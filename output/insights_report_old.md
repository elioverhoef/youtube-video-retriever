## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on the blood test data of supercentenarian Jirahiman, who lived to 116. The study covers biomarkers tracked between ages 112 and 116, revealing a complex picture of his health. While some markers like uric acid were close to optimal, many indicators related to liver function, red blood cells, and cholesterol were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. Notably, despite poor kidney function markers, Jirahiman's uric acid remained near optimal, potentially due to a low dietary intake of purines. His total protein appeared superficially good, but detailed analysis showed low albumin and high globulin, indicative of poor health. Markers of liver function (GOT, GPT, GGT, cholinesterase) were suboptimal, suggesting compromised liver health. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets were also suboptimal, further increasing his all-cause mortality risk. While his total cholesterol was low, in combination with low albumin, it was likely detrimental rather than beneficial. The analysis underscores the importance of comprehensive biomarker assessment, going beyond surface-level readings to understand the intricate relationships affecting health and longevity. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

This transcript explores the effects of trigonelline, derived from clover sprouts, on NAD+ levels. The experimenter doubled his intake of clover sprouts from an average of 12.1 grams per day to 27.1 grams per day, but surprisingly, his NAD+ levels decreased from 29.6 micromolar to 19 micromolar. This raises questions about the optimal dosage of trigonelline for boosting NAD+ and whether the initial increase was due to random variation or a residual effect of nicotinic acid. The experimenter considers coffee as a potential source of trigonelline but expresses reluctance due to the need to eliminate green tea to maintain caffeine neutrality. The overall findings suggest that a simple linear relationship between dietary trigonelline intake and NAD+ levels may not exist, and further research is needed to understand the complex interplay of dietary factors and NAD+ metabolism. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

This podcast features a detailed discussion with Michael Lustgarten, a scientist and biohacker dedicated to extending human lifespan. Lustgarten's approach involves meticulous tracking of diet, physical activity, sleep, and a wide array of biomarkers, including blood, epigenetic, and microbiome data. His primary goal is to optimize these factors to achieve "super longevity." The conversation highlights the importance of personalized health tracking, the limitations of traditional medical approaches, and the potential of emerging technologies like epigenetic clocks. Lustgarten's methods emphasize the interconnectedness of various health parameters and the need for a holistic, data-driven approach to health optimization. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Quick Reference

*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Maintain uric acid levels around 5.09 mg/dL (303 ¬µmol/L) for lowest all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Low total cholesterol (<160 mg/dL) may be detrimental if accompanied by low albumin (<38 g/L).
    *   Monitor liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT) and aim for AST/ALT ratio less than 1.83.
    *   Higher cholinesterase levels are associated with reduced all-cause mortality.
    *   Hematocrit levels around 43.5% are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

-   Doubling clover sprout intake (from 12.1g to 27.1g/day) resulted in a significant *decrease* in NAD+ levels (from 29.6 to 19 micromolar).
-   The initial NAD+ level of 29.6 micromolar after consuming 12.1g of clover sprouts might be due to random variation or a lingering effect of previous nicotinic acid supplementation.
-   The experimenter's baseline NAD+ range without precursors is 18.5 to 26.6 micromolar.
-   Coffee is being considered as an alternative source of trigonelline, but the experiment would require eliminating green tea consumption.
-   The optimal dosage of trigonelline for boosting NAD+ remains unclear. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

## Scientific Methods

*   **Study Type:** Observational, Case Study
    *   **Methodology:** Analysis of blood test data from a supercentenarian, Jirahiman, taken at three time points (111.5, 113.3, and 115.7 years old). Comparison of Jirahiman's biomarker levels with all-cause mortality data from various studies.
    *   **Key Findings:** Multiple biomarkers in Jirahiman were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, including markers of liver function, red blood cells, and cholesterol.
    *   **Limitations:** Case study of a single individual, limiting generalizability. Lack of dietary and lifestyle information.

*   **Study Type:** Observational
    *   **Methodology:** Examination of the relationship between total protein, albumin, globulin (gamma gap), and all-cause mortality in older adults (average age 94).
    *   **Key Findings:** Higher globulin levels (>3.2 g/dL) were associated with a significantly shorter survival time.
    *   **Limitations:** While the study population was elderly, the age gap with Jirahiman (20+ years) may affect the direct applicability of the findings.

*   **Study Type:** Observational
    *   **Methodology:** Assessment of the association between liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT) and all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Key Findings:** Higher levels of AST, ALT, and GGT were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. An AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.83 was associated with significantly higher mortality.
    *   **Limitations:** Observational studies cannot establish causality.

*   **Study Type:** Observational
    *   **Methodology:** Analysis of the age-related changes in cholinesterase levels and its association with all-cause mortality.
    *   **Key Findings:** Cholinesterase declines with age. Higher cholinesterase levels are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Limitations:** Observational study, causality not established.

*   **Study Type:** Observational
    *   **Methodology:** Investigation of the relationship between hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Key Findings:** Lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. Optimal hematocrit for lowest risk was around 43.5%.
    *   **Limitations:** Observational studies cannot prove causation.

*   **Study Type:** Observational
    *   **Methodology:** Evaluation of the association between total cholesterol and all-cause mortality risk in older adults (75-99 years) and the influence of albumin and HDL on this relationship.
    *   **Key Findings:** In this age group, higher total cholesterol (200-229 mg/dL) was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality. However, among individuals with total cholesterol <160 mg/dL, low albumin (<38 g/L) was associated with the highest mortality risk, while high albumin and high HDL were associated with the lowest risk.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size for the subgroup with total cholesterol <160 mg/dL was relatively small (n=393).
-   **Study Type:** Case Study/Self-Experimentation
    -   **Methodology:** The experimenter manipulated his diet by adding and increasing the intake of clover sprouts, a source of trigonelline. Blood intracellular NAD+ levels were measured using a commercial service (Jinfiniti).
    -   **Key Findings:** Increased clover sprout intake did not lead to a corresponding increase in NAD+ levels. Instead, a significant decrease was observed.
    -   **Limitations:** Single subject, uncontrolled variables, potential for bias, lack of a control group.

-   **Study Type:** Review
    -   **Methodology:** The experimenter refers to previous research he conducted and cites existing literature on the trigonelline content of various foods.
