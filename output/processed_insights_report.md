- **Finding**: Individuals over 50, particularly those with ancestry from the northwestern periphery of Eurasia, may benefit from reducing or eliminating consumption of grains, rice, corn, dairy, and legumes. Studies on fruit flies have shown that diet modification can impact lifespan and that even after 1000 generations of adaptation to a lab diet, reverting to an ancestral diet improved health in older fruit flies, suggesting a potential benefit of ancestral diets for aging populations.
    - Context: Based on the concept that humans, after their 50s, may no longer be adapted to agricultural foods due to the detuning of natural selection with age. This is supported by research on fruit flies, including work by Grant Rutledge and Dr. Rose's lab, showing improved health outcomes in fruit flies fed diets closer to their ancestral diets, even after extensive adaptation to a novel diet. Mathematical models by Larry Muller support the generalizability of these findings.
    - Timeframe: Ongoing, with benefits potentially realized quickly upon dietary adjustment, particularly in later stages of life.
    - Effects: Diet modification can impact lifespan, and reverting to an ancestral diet improved health in older fruit flies.
    - Limitations: Individual responses may vary based on specific genetic background and health status. Further research is needed to quantify the exact benefits and optimal dietary composition for different ancestries in humans. While the fruit fly studies provide valuable insights, direct applicability to humans is still under investigation.

- **Comprehensive Dietary Insight**: Wheat germ is the most concentrated dietary source of spermidine, containing 24.3 mg/100g. Consuming about 30g of wheat germ daily can provide approximately 12 mg of spermidine. Other notable dietary sources of spermidine include natto, green bell peppers, mushrooms, chicken liver, and grilled chicken. An intake of over 11.6 mg/day of spermidine is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk in humans, based on a 20-year observational study. Mushrooms are a significant source of both spermidine and ergothioneine, with white button mushrooms containing 630 mg/kg (dry weight) and great oyster mushrooms containing 1.3 g/kg (dry weight) of ergothioneine. Other foods containing ergothioneine include oats (2 mg/kg), kidney beans (2 mg/kg), oat bran (4+ mg/kg), chicken liver (40+ mg/kg), tempeh (201 mg/kg), garlic, and Mexican asparagus (green). Consuming mushrooms more frequently may lead to higher whole blood levels of ergothioneine. Mushroom intake has been observed to inversely correlate with levels of PCS and IS. Additionally, higher mushroom intake positively correlates with lower alkaline phosphatase, AST, CRP, LDL, and platelets, but higher homocysteine. A personal dietary practice includes consuming 166.5g/day of mushrooms, yielding 11.8mg/day of spermidine, and adjustments up to 231g per day have been made based on observed correlations with health markers. Lower intakes of onions and protein, along with increased intake of cardamom (2g/day), have been correlated with lower Serratia levels in the oral microbiome.
    - Context: Analysis of spermidine and ergothioneine content in various foods, observational studies on their health effects, and personal dietary practices.
    - Effects: Spermidine intake over 11.6 mg/day is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk. Mushroom consumption is associated with higher ergothioneine levels, lower PCS and IS, lower alkaline phosphatase, AST, CRP, LDL, and platelets, but higher homocysteine. Lower onion and protein intake, and higher cardamom intake, are correlated with lower Serratia levels.
    - Limitations: Lists of foods analyzed for spermidine and ergothioneine are not comprehensive. Individual absorption of spermidine may vary. Human studies on spermidine and ergothioneine are largely observational, not causal. Optimal dosages are not yet established. Dry weight measurements may not translate to typical consumption. Self-reported dietary data can be unreliable. Gut bacteria can degrade ergothioneine. Correlations based on personal data may not apply to the general population. Specific quantities for optimal effects are often not provided.
    - Confidence: Variable (1-4 stars)

- **Merged Insight**: Dietary interventions, particularly calorie restriction (CR), methionine restriction, and fasting, significantly impact lifespan and healthspan across various species, including mice, rats, and humans. CR, ranging from 12% to 50%, has consistently been shown to extend both median and maximum lifespan in mice, with a 40% CR demonstrating a 36% increase in median lifespan and improved physical activity in one study. In humans, a 12% CR over two years slowed the epigenetic pace of aging. Methionine restriction has also demonstrated lifespan extension in mice (6.6% increase in median lifespan), rats (29% increase in median survival), and a progeria mouse model (20% increase in median lifespan), often accompanied by increased levels of cholic acid, FGF21, and fecal and plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, a low AGE diet improved lifespan and insulin sensitivity in both mice and humans. Fasting, even without CR, can extend lifespan, with one or two days of fasting per week showing benefits in mice. Combining CR with time-restricted feeding, particularly when aligned with the circadian rhythm, further enhances lifespan extension. For instance, 30% CR with a 12 or 22-hour fast, with feeding restricted to the night (circadian alignment), increased median lifespan by 35% in male mice. A high polyamine diet has also been shown to extend the median lifespan in mice. However, the magnitude of these effects can vary depending on the specific protocol, the species, and even the strain of the animal studied. For example, severe CR (around 50%) has historically shown the largest lifespan extension in mice, but these results are difficult to replicate, and there are potential ethical concerns. Furthermore, while a ketogenic diet showed some lifespan extension in mice, the results were not as impressive as those seen with CR.
    - Context: Multiple studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, conducted on mice, rats, and humans, investigating the effects of various dietary interventions on lifespan and health-related markers.
    - Effects: CR extends lifespan and improves physical activity in mice; 12% CR slows epigenetic aging in humans; methionine restriction extends lifespan in mice, rats, and a progeria mouse model, increases cholic acid, FGF21, and SCFAs; low AGE diet improves lifespan and insulin sensitivity; fasting extends lifespan in mice; combining CR with time-restricted feeding enhances lifespan extension; high polyamine diet extends lifespan in mice; a 12-hour eating window is as effective as a 2-hour window for increasing lifespan when combined with 30% CR and circadian alignment; single-meal feeding without significant calorie restriction increased lifespan.
    - Limitations: Many studies were conducted on mice, and direct translation to humans requires further research. The magnitude of CR's effect varies by strain and is less pronounced in longer-lived animals. Specific dietary compositions beyond CR percentage are often not detailed. Long-term effects of methionine restriction on other health parameters are not fully explored. Some studies only looked at specific tissues or markers. The magnitude of CR effect doesn't fully replicate across studies, potentially due to strain differences, variations in restriction protocols and purified vs standard chow. Regression to the mean must be accounted for. Ethical concerns exist with severe CR. Human data on lifespan extension from dietary interventions is limited. Exact quantities of nutrients in diets not always discussed. Some studies involved only male animals, or only looked at specific health markers. The impact of the ketogenic diet was not as impressive as CR. Optimal taurine intake for humans is not defined. The p-value for maximum lifespan increase in the progeria mouse model with methionine restriction was not statistically significant. The single-meal feeding group on the NIA diet may have had a mild calorie restriction of about 6%.
    - Confidence: Generally high (4-5 stars) for the effects of CR and methionine restriction on lifespan in animal models, moderate (3-4 stars) for the effects of fasting and other specific dietary interventions, and lower (1-3 stars) for the speculative aspects of human application and the impact of interventions like taurine and ketogenic diets.

    - Context: Multiple studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, conducted on mice, rats, and humans, investigating the effects of various dietary interventions on lifespan and health-related markers.
    - Effects: CR extends lifespan and improves physical activity in mice; 12% CR slows epigenetic aging in humans; methionine restriction extends lifespan in mice, rats, and a progeria mouse model, increases cholic acid, FGF21, and SCFAs; low AGE diet improves lifespan and insulin sensitivity; fasting extends lifespan in mice; combining CR with time-restricted feeding enhances lifespan extension; high polyamine diet extends lifespan in mice; a 12-hour eating window is as effective as a 2-hour window for increasing lifespan when combined with 30% CR and circadian alignment; single-meal feeding without significant calorie restriction increased lifespan.
    - Limitations: Many studies were conducted on mice, and direct translation to humans requires further research. The magnitude of CR's effect varies by strain and is less pronounced in longer-lived animals. Specific dietary compositions beyond CR percentage are often not detailed. Long-term effects of methionine restriction on other health parameters are not fully explored. Some studies only looked at specific tissues or markers. The magnitude of CR effect doesn't fully replicate across studies, potentially due to strain differences, variations in restriction protocols and purified vs standard chow. Regression to the mean must be accounted for. Ethical concerns exist with severe CR. Human data on lifespan extension from dietary interventions is limited. Exact quantities of nutrients in diets not always discussed. Some studies involved only male animals, or only looked at specific health markers. The impact of the ketogenic diet was not as impressive as CR. Optimal taurine intake for humans is not defined. The p-value for maximum lifespan increase in the progeria mouse model with methionine restriction was not statistically significant. The single-meal feeding group on the NIA diet may have had a mild calorie restriction of about 6%.
    - Confidence: Generally high (4-5 stars) for the effects of CR and methionine restriction on lifespan in animal models, moderate (3-4 stars) for the effects of fasting and other specific dietary interventions, and lower (1-3 stars) for the speculative aspects of human application and the impact of interventions like taurine and ketogenic diets.

- **Finding**: Individuals over 50, particularly those with ancestry from the northwestern periphery of Eurasia, may benefit from reducing or eliminating consumption of grains, rice, corn, dairy, and legumes. Studies on fruit flies have shown that diet modification can impact lifespan and that even after 1000 generations of adaptation to a lab diet, reverting to an ancestral diet improved health in older fruit flies, suggesting a potential benefit of ancestral diets for aging populations.
    - Context: Based on the concept that humans, after their 50s, may no longer be adapted to agricultural foods due to the detuning of natural selection with age. This is supported by research on fruit flies, including work by Grant Rutledge and Dr. Rose's lab, showing improved health outcomes in fruit flies fed diets closer to their ancestral diets, even after extensive adaptation to a novel diet. Mathematical models by Larry Muller support the generalizability of these findings.
    - Timeframe: Ongoing, with benefits potentially realized quickly upon dietary adjustment, particularly in later stages of life.
    - Effects: Diet modification can impact lifespan, and reverting to an ancestral diet improved health in older fruit flies.
    - Limitations: Individual responses may vary based on specific genetic background and health status. Further research is needed to quantify the exact benefits and optimal dietary composition for different ancestries in humans. While the fruit fly studies provide valuable insights, direct applicability to humans is still under investigation.

- **Comprehensive Dietary Analysis**: This comprehensive analysis integrates dietary data primarily from a single individual's self-tracked records spanning several years, with additional insights from observational studies. Key findings include an average daily calorie intake ranging from 2092 to 2373 kcal, with the lowest recorded intake since tracking began being 2122 kcal/day. The individual maintained a macronutrient ratio of approximately 44% fat, 38% net carbs, and 18.6% protein, with adjustments made over time based on biomarker correlations. Notably, protein intake was consistent at around 100g/day (18-19% of total calories), while fat intake was reduced from 116g/day to as low as 82g/day due to observed correlations with elevated glucose and other negative biomarkers. Carbohydrate intake varied, with net carbs at 203-216g/day and a focus on maintaining high fiber intake (85-88g/day) to support gut health and SCFA production. Fructose intake was limited to 56-61g/day, primarily sourced from fruits and vegetables, due to its correlation with adverse blood biomarker changes. Cheat meals were minimal, comprising less than 1.2% of total caloric intake. Specific food items highlighted include increased intake of strawberries (up to 622g/day), watermelon (200g/day), and whole grains (154g/day), while reducing barley and date consumption. The diet also included a focus on increasing dietary cholesterol through egg consumption and monitoring the impact on blood biomarkers. Lower levels of specific diglycerides and triglycerides are associated with a higher healthy lifestyle score. Consistent whole-food diet is associated with younger biological age. Lower body weight is correlated with improved RHR and HRV. Higher calorie intake is associated with higher RHR and lower HRV, as well as being significantly correlated with higher RDW. Higher carbohydrate intake (both fructose and non-fructose) is associated with higher RHR. Higher monounsaturated fatty acid intake (>20g/day) is associated with lower RHR and higher HRV. A diet high in soluble fiber promotes short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, while the Western diet is associated with gut dysbiosis. Higher daily fat intake, especially saturated fat, is strongly correlated with increased plasma glucose levels, while higher fiber density is correlated with lower glucose levels. Yogurt consumption is associated with higher glucose and creatinine levels. Higher fat intake is correlated with lower CRP levels, and higher monounsaturated fatty acid intake may reduce hs-CRP levels. High intake of dietary CD38 inhibitors is correlated with both lower glucose levels and potentially undesirable reductions in platelet and red blood cell counts. Increasing calorie intake from 2080 kcal/day to 2150-2800 kcal/day may improve lymphocyte levels. Higher carbohydrate and fructose intake are correlated with lower HDL cholesterol, with an ideal fructose intake below 70g/day to achieve optimal HDL levels. Increased vegetable and sardine intake, along with lower beef intake and a diet higher in fiber and omega-3s and lower in protein, are correlated with higher eGFR.
    - Context: This analysis primarily draws from a single individual's detailed dietary tracking and biomarker data from 2015 to the present, supplemented with insights from various observational studies. The individual is a male diagnosed with hypothyroidism, aiming to optimize health and longevity through dietary modifications.
    - Effects: The dietary interventions and observations span from immediate effects (e.g., RHR, HRV) to long-term impacts on biomarkers and physiological parameters. Timeframes for observing effects vary from daily to over several years.
    - Limitations: The primary limitation is the reliance on self-reported data from a single individual, which may not be generalizable to the broader population. Additionally, many findings are correlational rather than causal, and individual responses to dietary changes may vary. Some data points have limited external validation, and certain analyses are based on a small number of data points or are yet to be conducted.
    - Confidence: Most insights are rated with a confidence of 2 or 3 out of 5 stars, indicating moderate confidence in the findings due to the limitations mentioned above. Some specific observations have a confidence rating of 1 or 4, and a few are not rated (N/A).

- **Finding**: A self-experiment involving saturated fat intake was conducted. Initially, saturated fat intake was increased to 25g/day for 3 weeks, primarily from coconut butter (increased from 16g/day to 26g/day). Subsequently, cocoa bean and coconut butter intake was reduced by about half, leading to a 12g reduction in total fat and an 8g reduction in saturated fat. This was implemented over approximately 30 days prior to the most recent blood test.
    - Context: Personal dietary intervention and observation aiming to assess the impact of saturated fat intake on health markers, including LDL cholesterol and potentially the epigenetic pace of aging.
    - Effects: The effect on the epigenetic pace of aging is yet to be determined.
    - Limitations: Self-experiment, observational data, short duration, individual results, no control group.

- **Comprehensive Dietary Analysis**: This comprehensive analysis integrates dietary data primarily from a single individual's self-tracked records spanning several years, with additional insights from observational studies. Key findings include an average daily calorie intake ranging from 2092 to 2373 kcal, with the lowest recorded intake since tracking began being 2122 kcal/day. The individual maintained a macronutrient ratio of approximately 44% fat, 38% net carbs, and 18.6% protein, with adjustments made over time based on biomarker correlations. Notably, protein intake was consistent at around 100g/day (18-19% of total calories), while fat intake was reduced from 116g/day to as low as 82g/day due to observed correlations with elevated glucose and other negative biomarkers. Carbohydrate intake varied, with net carbs at 203-216g/day and a focus on maintaining high fiber intake (85-88g/day) to support gut health and SCFA production. Fructose intake was limited to 56-61g/day, primarily sourced from fruits and vegetables, due to its correlation with adverse blood biomarker changes. Cheat meals were minimal, comprising less than 1.2% of total caloric intake. Specific food items highlighted include increased intake of strawberries (up to 622g/day), watermelon (200g/day), and whole grains (154g/day), while reducing barley and date consumption. The diet also included a focus on increasing dietary cholesterol through egg consumption and monitoring the impact on blood biomarkers. Lower levels of specific diglycerides and triglycerides are associated with a higher healthy lifestyle score. Consistent whole-food diet is associated with younger biological age. Lower body weight is correlated with improved RHR and HRV. Higher calorie intake is associated with higher RHR and lower HRV, as well as being significantly correlated with higher RDW. Higher carbohydrate intake (both fructose and non-fructose) is associated with higher RHR. Higher monounsaturated fatty acid intake (>20g/day) is associated with lower RHR and higher HRV. A diet high in soluble fiber promotes short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, while the Western diet is associated with gut dysbiosis. Higher daily fat intake, especially saturated fat, is strongly correlated with increased plasma glucose levels, while higher fiber density is correlated with lower glucose levels. Yogurt consumption is associated with higher glucose and creatinine levels. Higher fat intake is correlated with lower CRP levels, and higher monounsaturated fatty acid intake may reduce hs-CRP levels. High intake of dietary CD38 inhibitors is correlated with both lower glucose levels and potentially undesirable reductions in platelet and red blood cell counts. Increasing calorie intake from 2080 kcal/day to 2150-2800 kcal/day may improve lymphocyte levels. Higher carbohydrate and fructose intake are correlated with lower HDL cholesterol, with an ideal fructose intake below 70g/day to achieve optimal HDL levels. Increased vegetable and sardine intake, along with lower beef intake and a diet higher in fiber and omega-3s and lower in protein, are correlated with higher eGFR.
    - Context: This analysis primarily draws from a single individual's detailed dietary tracking and biomarker data from 2015 to the present, supplemented with insights from various observational studies.

- **Finding**: Trigonelline is found in high concentrations in fenugreek seeds and coffee beans, with wild fenugreek in India potentially containing up to 12% trigonelline. Consuming three to four cups of coffee per day leads to approximately 8-10 μM of trigonelline in plasma. To match the 1.7-1.8 grams of trigonelline used in mouse studies, approximately 13 grams of fenugreek extract would be needed.
    - Context: Expert opinion based on literature review and observational studies, highlighting natural sources and dosage of trigonelline.
    - Timeframe: Not specified.
    - Limitations: The exact amount of trigonelline needed from dietary sources to impact NAD+ levels and health outcomes is not yet known. The plasma concentration from coffee consumption may not be sufficient to significantly modulate NAD+ levels.

- **Summary Finding**: Dietary interventions involving parsley, dill, red/purple onions, alfalfa sprouts, crimson clover sprouts, chickpeas, and blackberries may influence NAD+ levels. Parsley (40g every other day) provides apigenin (4500mg/100g), dill (15g or more) and red/purple onions provide quercetin (55.5mg/100g in dill), both of which inhibit CD38, potentially increasing NAD+. Blackberries (41g daily) and parsley (17g daily) also contain cyanidin and apigenin respectively. Alfalfa sprouts (100-147g daily), crimson clover sprouts (121g daily initially, then increased to 271g daily), and chickpeas (average 243g daily or 20-25mg of trigonelline) are sources of trigonelline, which may also impact NAD+ levels, with usual dietary trigonelline intake estimated at around 70mg per day. Red clover seeds contain approximately 5x more trigonelline than alfalfa sprouts. One individual consumed 132g/day of alfalfa sprouts for 8 days, providing 24mg/day of trigonelline.
    - Context: Multiple observational studies and self-experiments exploring the impact of various foods and their constituents (apigenin, quercetin, trigonelline) on NAD+ levels and biological age. These include the consumption of parsley as a concentrated source of apigenin, dill as a source of quercetin, red/purple onions as a source of quercetin, alfalfa sprouts, crimson clover sprouts, and chickpeas as sources of trigonelline, and the intake of blackberries and parsley as sources of CD38 inhibitors.
    - Effects: Inhibition of CD38 by apigenin and quercetin is expected to increase NAD+ levels relatively rapidly. Trigonelline from food sources like alfalfa sprouts and chickpeas may also influence NAD+ levels, although the exact relationship and optimal dosage are still under investigation. Increasing crimson clover sprout intake from 121g to 271g daily resulted in a significant decrease in NAD+ levels in one individual. An increase in biological age was seen in one individual when consuming 120g/day of alfalfa sprouts, resulting in the subject increasing their intake to 147g/day in a follow-up test.
    - Limitations: Many studies are observational with single individuals, making it difficult to establish causality. The exact timeframe and magnitude of NAD+ increase from specific food intakes are often not detailed. Individual absorption, metabolism, and responses may vary. The trigonelline content in different foods can vary, and optimal dosages for impacting NAD+ levels are not yet determined. The relationship between trigonelline intake and NAD+ levels may be non-linear.

Alfalfa sprouts (100-147g daily), crimson clover sprouts (121g daily initially, then increased to 271g daily), and chickpeas (average 243g daily or 20-25mg of trigonelline) are sources of trigonelline, which may also impact NAD+ levels, with usual dietary trigonelline intake estimated at around 70mg per day. Red clover seeds contain approximately 5x more trigonelline than alfalfa sprouts. One individual consumed 132g/day of alfalfa sprouts for 8 days, providing 24mg/day of trigonelline.
    - Context: Multiple observational studies and self-experiments exploring the impact of various foods and their constituents (apigenin, quercetin, trigonelline) on NAD+ levels and biological age. These include the consumption of parsley as a concentrated source of apigenin, dill as a source of quercetin, red/purple onions as a source of quercetin, alfalfa sprouts, crimson clover sprouts, and chickpeas as sources of trigonelline, and the intake of blackberries and parsley as sources of CD38 inhibitors.
    - Effects: Inhibition of CD38 by apigenin and quercetin is expected to increase NAD+ levels relatively rapidly. Trigonelline from food sources like alfalfa sprouts and chickpeas may also influence NAD+ levels, although the exact relationship and optimal dosage are still under investigation. Increasing crimson clover sprout intake from 121g to 271g daily resulted in a significant decrease in NAD+ levels in one individual. An increase in biological age was seen in one individual when consuming 120g/day of alfalfa sprouts, resulting in the subject increasing their intake to 147g/day in a follow-up test.
    - Limitations: Many studies are observational with single individuals, making it difficult to establish causality. The exact timeframe and magnitude of NAD+ increase from specific food intakes are often not detailed. Individual absorption, metabolism, and responses may vary. The trigonelline content in different foods can vary, and optimal dosages for impacting NAD+ levels are not yet determined. The relationship between trigonelline intake and NAD+ levels may be non-linear.

- **Summary Finding**: Dietary interventions involving parsley, dill, red/purple onions, alfalfa sprouts, crimson clover sprouts, chickpeas, and blackberries may influence NAD+ levels. Parsley (40g every other day) provides apigenin (4500mg/100g), dill (15g or more) and red/purple onions provide quercetin (55.5mg/100g in dill), both of which inhibit CD38, potentially increasing NAD+. Blackberries (41g daily) and parsley (17g daily) also contain cyanidin and apigenin respectively. Alfalfa sprouts (100-147g daily), crimson clover sprouts (121g daily initially, then increased to 271g daily), and chickpeas (average 243g daily or 20-25mg of trigonelline) are sources of trigonelline, which may also impact NAD+ levels, with usual dietary trigonelline intake estimated at around 70mg per day.

- **Finding**: Several dietary factors are correlated with telomere length. Positive correlations were observed for cloves (r=0.7), broccoli, flaxseed (even after adjusting for calorie intake), and a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (maintained below 2:1). Conversely, higher calorie intake and higher parmesan cheese intake (even after adjusting for calorie intake) are negatively correlated with telomere length. Intakes of Brazil nuts, vitamin B1, cacao beans, and black pepper showed positive correlations with telomere length, but these were not significant after adjusting for calorie intake.
    - Context: Observational data and case studies from a single individual, including telomere length tests paired with detailed dietary records. Data collected over a year (2022-2023) with ongoing monitoring, including at least 15 telomere length tests and corresponding dietary intake averaged over periods between tests (e.g., 60 days). Specific correlation coefficients provided where available (cloves r=0.7, others P<0.05).
    - Effects: Observed changes in telomere length associated with various dietary components.
    - Timeframe: Ongoing; clove intake telomere length test update expected in September. Other factors are also being continuously monitored.
    - Limitations: All findings are based on correlational data from a single individual; causation has not been established. Potential for unmeasured confounding factors exists. Findings regarding Brazil nuts, vitamin B1, cacao beans, and black pepper are not significant after adjusting for calorie intake.

- **Finding**: The relationship between vitamin B6 intake and intracellular NAD+ levels is complex and potentially dose-dependent. While an increase in B6 intake from 3.2 mg/day to 11.3-15.6 mg/day was associated with a minor increase in NAD+ levels (from 25.6 µM to 30.1 µM) in one case, another case showed that increasing B6 intake from 3.2 mg/day to 11.3 mg/day and then further to 37.2 mg/day resulted in a decrease in NAD+ levels from 30.1 µM to 22.3 µM. Niacin intake, which remained relatively stable around 40mg per day, did not appear to correlate with NAD+ levels in these cases.
    - Context: Case studies and self-experiment (n=1 or 2), male individuals, age not specified. Diet tracked through weighing food and using an app, or self-reported. NAD+ levels measured via blood tests. Niacin intake was also tracked.
    - Effects: Variable effects of Vitamin B6 on NAD+ levels; no observed effect of stable Niacin intake on NAD+ levels.
    - Limitations: Single individual(s), observational and self-reported data, potential confounding factors not accounted for, no control groups.
    - Confidence: Mixed: 2 ⭐⭐ for the positive correlation at lower doses, 1 ⭐ for the negative correlation at higher doses

- **Protocol**: Combined Supplementation and Individual Compound Studies
    - Context: Data pooled from multiple RCTs and observational studies in mice and humans. Studies involved interventions with Glycine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Canagliflozin, and Alpha-ketoglutarate, either individually or in combination. Human studies with Glycine + NAC included older adults aged 61-80 years. Mouse studies varied in age at which supplementation began.
    - Effects: Glycine supplementation alone increased median lifespan by 4% in female mice and 6% in male mice, with a 6% increase in maximum lifespan for male mice. Glycine + NAC supplementation in older adults improved glutathione levels, reduced oxidative stress, genomic damage, inflammation, insulin resistance, and improved mitochondrial function, endothelial function, body composition, muscle strength, exercise capacity, cognition, cellular senescence, stem cell markers, mitophagy, and reduced blood pressure. In mice, Glycine + NAC extended median lifespan by 24% and restored glutathione in heart, liver, and kidney. Canagliflozin increased median lifespan by 14% in long-lived male mice. NAC alone increased median lifespan by 19.6% in one study but failed in a second. Alpha-ketoglutarate increased average and maximum lifespan in female mice but had no significant effect in male mice.
    - Limitations: Many studies were conducted only in mice. Human studies on Glycine + NAC had small sample sizes and lacked data on food intake and body weight. Canagliflozin's effect on lifespan was limited to male mice. NAC showed inconsistent results across studies. Alpha-ketoglutarate was less effective than FGF21 overexpression.

- **Protocol**: While no specific supplement protocols are explicitly mentioned, the potential for supplementation to influence various biomarkers and health outcomes is highlighted. This includes the possibility of increasing EPA and DHA levels through omega-3 supplementation to potentially reduce all-cause mortality risk, and a past instance of DHEA supplementation which may or may not have impacted current DHEA-sulfate levels. The transcript emphasizes the importance of dietary intake, particularly calcium, and correlations between dietary components, such as nutrients and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and telomere length are observed. The lack of specific supplement protocols makes it challenging to determine the precise effects of supplementation in this context.
    - Context: The context varies across the insights, ranging from a meta-analysis on EPA/DHA and mortality risk to personal records of DHEA supplementation and observations on dietary intake. Correlations between dietary components and telomere length are noted in one instance. Supplements are mentioned as a contributing factor but not elaborated upon.
    - Effects: The potential effects of supplementation include increased circulating EPA and DHA, potentially reducing all-cause mortality risk. Past DHEA supplementation may have influenced DHEA-sulfate levels, but the current impact is unknown. The effects of other potential supplement protocols are not applicable as they are not defined.
    - Limitations: Optimal dosage and form of omega-3 supplementation are not provided, and individual needs may vary. The relationship between past DHEA supplementation and current levels is unclear, as is whether current levels are suboptimal. For most insights, no specific supplement protocols or dosages are mentioned, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about their effects.
    - Confidence: Ranging from N/A to 3 ⭐⭐⭐, reflecting the varying levels of evidence and specificity in the individual insights.

- **Protocol**: A variety of supplements have been explored for their effects on NAD+ and homocysteine levels, primarily through case studies involving single individuals. Nicotinic Acid (Niacin) has shown to increase NAD+ levels at dosages of 50-60 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and when combined with Tryptophan, with varying degrees of effectiveness and potential impacts on epigenetic aging. Dosages of 27-45 mg/day were ineffective in other instances. NMN at 300 mg/day showed no significant change in NAD+ levels in one study, while 1000 mg/day increased NAD+ levels in another. Trigonelline gavage at 300 mg/kg significantly increased NAD+ levels in mice, but 51 mg/day or 500 mg/day showed no effect in humans. Methyl B12 supplementation, typically at 1000 mcg every three days or daily, has been used to manage homocysteine levels, with some individuals reporting a reduction in homocysteine. However, discontinuing B12 supplementation has also been considered due to correlations with negative changes in biomarkers. Other supplements like Vitamin B6, Serine, BCAAs, Glycine, Niacin (828 mg/day), and Tryptophan (2 g/day) have also been used with varying or no impact on homocysteine and NAD+ levels.
    - Context: The majority of the data comes from case studies involving single individuals, often the speaker, exploring the effects of various supplements on NAD+ and homocysteine levels. Some data points are derived from expert opinions or animal studies.
    - Effects: Nicotinic Acid (Niacin) can increase NAD+ levels at higher doses (50-60 mg/day and above), but lower doses (27-45 mg/day) may be ineffective. NMN effects on NAD+ varied between studies. Methyl B12 can reduce homocysteine levels in some individuals. Trigonelline increased NAD+ in mice but not humans at the tested dosages. Other supplements had varying or no impact.
    - Limitations: Most studies are based on single individuals, limiting generalizability. Many studies have short durations. Dosages and effects are often individual-specific. Some studies are observational or based on self-reported data. Confounding factors may exist in some cases.
    - Confidence: The confidence in the findings varies. Studies involving mice have a high confidence (4 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50). Studies involving single individuals generally have a confidence of 2-3 \u2b50, while those based on expert opinions or with less clear methodologies have a confidence of 1 \u2b50.

## Health Markers

- **Markers Overview**: Comprehensive analysis of Resting Heart Rate (RHR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR), and Body Weight, including their interrelationships and influencing factors.
    - Context: Data derived from a combination of large-scale studies and personal tracking over periods ranging from 42 days to multiple years (up to 6 years, 2018-2024). Measurements include daily tracking and periodic averages. RMSSD is used as a specific metric for HRV in some instances.
    - Effects: RHR generally increases with age until 50, then decreases; it's positively correlated with higher physical activity, body weight, and calorie intake, but negatively correlated with monounsaturated and omega-6 fatty acid intake. A lower RHR (around 45 bpm) is associated with lower all-cause mortality. HRV declines with age but increases with monounsaturated fatty acid, omega-6 fatty acid, and protein intake; it decreases with higher physical activity, body weight, calorie intake, fructose, saturated fatty acid, and fiber intake. Higher HRV indicates better cardiovascular health and is inversely correlated with body weight and previous day's ADHR. ADHR is used as a physical activity index, with higher values correlated with higher next-day RHR and lower next-day HRV. Body weight is significantly correlated with RHR and HRV, with lower body weight associated with improved RHR and HRV. Melatonin supplementation in the middle of the night resulted in an increase in HRV (RMSSD) of 2.2 ms and a decrease in RHR of 1.1 bpm over 162 days.
    - Limitations: Some data relies on personal tracking, which may have individual variability. The specific impact of various factors can fluctuate daily. The exact mechanisms underlying some correlations are not fully detailed.
    - Confidence: Ranges from 2-7 stars, with most insights rated 3-4 stars. Higher confidence (4 stars) is associated with large-scale studies, while personal data-driven insights typically have 3 stars. Insights related to melatonin supplementation are rated 2 stars.

- **Marker**: Summary of Oxidative Stress Markers: Cystine, Cysteine, Methionine Sulfoxide, and Their Ratios
    - Context: In April 2023, the speaker's cystine level was 0.05 micromolar (50 nanomolar), cysteine level was 9.5 micromolar, and cystine/cysteine ratio was 0.06, all considered baseline and relatively low. The speaker's methionine sulfoxide level was 0.79 micromolar, relatively higher than cystine and considered a baseline that should ideally be reduced. Generally, the cystine/cysteine ratio increases with age, indicating increased oxidative stress. Similarly, methionine sulfoxide levels are higher in older individuals (e.g., centenarians compared to their offspring), suggesting the methionine sulfoxide/methionine ratio likely also increases with age, further indicating increased oxidative stress during aging.
    - Effects: The goal is to avoid an age-related increase in the cystine/cysteine ratio and to reduce the methionine sulfoxide level.
    - Limitations: Changes in methionine sulfoxide/methionine ratio over time need to be assessed based on baseline data.

- **Summary**: Studies on mice have demonstrated significant impacts of dietary modifications on various health markers. Low-methionine diets (ranging from 0.15% to 0.17%) led to a significant increase in fecal short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate), a two-fold increase in plasma FGF21, an increase in liver cholic acid levels, and a significant reduction in body weight compared to normal (0.86%) and high (2.58%) methionine diets. Methionine restriction also significantly increased median and maximum survival in both male and female mice. Separately, a low Advanced Glycation End-product (AGE) diet resulted in 50% lower insulin levels compared to a regular AGE diet and lower body weight despite similar food intake, with the difference in body weight becoming statistically significant at 96 weeks.
    - Context: Multiple studies involving dietary modifications in mice, primarily focusing on low-methionine and low-AGE diets.
    - Effects: Low-methionine diets increase fecal SCFAs, plasma FGF21, liver cholic acid, and lifespan, while reducing body weight. Low-AGE diets reduce insulin levels and body weight.
    - Limitations: The studies are primarily conducted on mice, and the direct applicability to humans is not specified. Timeframes varied across studies, and some were not specified.

- **Comprehensive Insight**: Glycine and NAC supplementation consistently demonstrates positive effects across multiple health markers in older adults, including improved cognition, cellular senescence, stem cell markers, insulin resistance, exercise capacity, and reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by multiple RCTs with a 16-24 week timeframe. Additionally, Glutathione (GSH) levels, which decline by approximately 50% during aging (from 21 to 61+ years), are restored to youthful levels with glycine + NAC supplementation in older adults over 16-24 weeks and in specific tissues of old mice. Observational studies further suggest a correlation between higher glycine and glutathione levels and longevity, with centenarians exhibiting about 50% higher blood glutathione levels compared to 67-year-olds and long-lived individuals (average age 97) having 10% higher blood glycine levels than their offspring (average age 67).
    - Context: RCTs in older adults and observational studies in humans and mice.
    - Effects: Glycine + NAC supplementation improves cognition, cellular senescence, stem cell markers, insulin resistance, exercise capacity, and reduces oxidative stress. It also restores glutathione levels. Higher glycine and glutathione levels are associated with longevity.
    - Limitations: The GSH/GSSG ratio, a direct indicator of oxidative stress, could not be directly measured due to the unavailability of individual GSH and GSSG tests in the US. Some data is from observational studies and animal models, which may not directly translate to human outcomes.

- **Marker**: DunedinPACE (Epigenetic Pace of Aging)
    - Context: DunedinPACE is a biomarker measuring the rate of epigenetic aging. A lower number indicates a slower pace of aging. The speaker's personal data, tracked over multiple tests (14 tests from 2022 to 2024), shows a relatively stable DunedinPACE (0.84 in 2022, 0.80 in 2023, 0.81 in 2024), with a current average of 0.787 over the past six months (five tests). This contrasts with the general population, where DunedinPACE typically increases with chronological age, based on cross-sectional data from TrueDiagnostic. The difference between the speaker's 2022 and 2023 averages is nearly statistically significant (p=0.052). One test result showed a DunedinPACE of 0.98 after taking 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid, suggesting a potentially negative effect of high-dose nicotinic acid. Another test result indicated a faster aging rate (0.98) with 67 µM NAD and a slower aging rate (0.75) with 22 µM NAD. The average over three tests, excluding the high NAD outlier, was 0.777.
    - Effects: The speaker's DunedinPACE has remained relatively stable or shown a slight decrease over time, indicating a slower rate of epigenetic aging compared to the general population trend. High-dose nicotinic acid may negatively impact DunedinPACE.
    - Limitations: The speaker's data is a case study of a single individual. Population data from TrueDiagnostic may be subject to healthy user bias. The effect of nicotinic acid is based on a single observation.

    - Change: Speaker: 0.84 (2022), 0.80 (2023), 0.81 (2024), 0.787 (average over the past six months). Population: Increases with chronological age. Case study: 0.98 with 67 µM NAD, 0.75 with 22 µM NAD, average of 0.777 over three tests (excluding outlier).
    - Timeframe: Speaker: 2022-2024. Population: Cross-sectional. Case study: Several months in 2023.

- **Comprehensive Insight**: Glycine and NAC supplementation consistently demonstrates positive effects across multiple health markers in older adults, including improved cognition, cellular senescence, stem cell markers, insulin resistance, exercise capacity, and reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by multiple RCTs with a 16-24 week timeframe. Additionally, Glutathione (GSH) levels, which decline by approximately 50% during aging (from 21 to 61+ years), are restored to youthful levels with glycine + NAC supplementation in older adults over 16-24 weeks and in specific tissues of old mice. Observational studies further suggest a correlation between higher glycine and glutathione levels and longevity, with centenarians exhibiting about 50% higher blood glutathione levels compared to 67-year-olds and long-lived individuals (average age 97) having 10% higher blood glycine levels than their offspring (average age 67).
    - Context: RCTs in older adults and observational studies in humans and mice.
    - Effects: Glycine + NAC supplementation improves cognition, cellular senescence, stem cell markers, insulin resistance, exercise capacity, and reduces oxidative stress. It also restores glutathione levels. Higher glycine and glutathione levels are associated with longevity.
    - Limitations: The GSH/GSSG ratio, a direct indicator of oxidative stress, could not be directly measured due to the unavailability of individual GSH and GSSG tests in the US. Some data is from observational studies and animal models, which may not directly translate to human outcomes.
    - Confidence: Mostly 3-4 stars

- **Marker**: DunedinPACE (Epigenetic Pace of Aging)
    - Context: DunedinPACE is a biomarker measuring the rate of epigenetic aging. A lower number indicates a slower pace of aging. The speaker's personal data, tracked over multiple tests (14 tests from 2022 to 2024), shows a relatively stable DunedinPACE (0.84 in 2022, 0.80 in 2023, 0.81 in 2024), with a current average of 0.787 over the past six months (five tests). This contrasts with the general population, where DunedinPACE typically increases with chronological age, based on cross-sectional data from TrueDiagnostic. The difference between the speaker's 2022 and 2023 averages is nearly statistically significant (p=0.052). One test result showed a DunedinPACE of 0.98 after taking 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid, suggesting a potentially negative effect of high-dose nicotinic acid. Another test result indicated a faster aging rate (0.98) with 67 µM NAD and a slower aging rate (0.75) with 22 µM NAD. The average over three tests, excluding the high NAD outlier, was 0.777.
    - Effects: The speaker's DunedinPACE has remained relatively stable or shown a slight decrease over time, indicating a slower rate of epigenetic aging compared to the general population trend. High-dose nicotinic acid may negatively impact DunedinPACE.
    - Limitations: The speaker's data is a case study of a single individual. Population data from TrueDiagnostic may be subject to healthy user bias. The effect of nicotinic acid is based on a single observation.

- **Collection**: A comprehensive overview of various health markers, their changes, optimal ranges, and associations with aging, mortality, and other health outcomes.
    - Context: The data presented comes from a variety of sources, including large-scale observational studies, longitudinal studies like the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), clinical trials, and personal data from individuals tracking their health metrics. Some data is derived from specific populations, such as centenarians or individuals with coronary artery disease, while other data is drawn from the general population. Specific interventions mentioned include dietary changes, tree planting initiatives, and the use of near-infrared (NIR) light therapy
    - Effects: Numerous health markers are associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease risk, and other health outcomes. Lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Triglycerides, and Glucose are generally associated with better health outcomes. Conversely, higher levels of Albumin, Lymphocytes, and in some cases, HDL Cholesterol are associated with positive outcomes. Biological age, as measured by Levine's Phenotypic Age and Aging.ai, is consistently lower than chronological age in individuals who track these markers. Interventions such as dietary changes (e.g., yogurt consumption, modified fat and protein intake), increased physical activity, and environmental factors (e.g., greenspace exposure) can influence these markers. Specific triglycerides, cholesterol esters and lifestyle also plays role in health and longevity. Rapamycin may reduce CRP levels in humans. The Horvath clock (epigenetic age) can be improved by lifestyle changes
    - Limitations: Much of the data is observational, making it difficult to establish causality. Some data is based on personal tracking, which may not be generalizable to the broader population. The effects of some markers may vary depending on age, sex, and underlying health conditions. Some associations, such as those between HDL and mortality, may be complex and not always consistent across studies. Optimal ranges for some markers may need further refinement. Further research is needed to confirm and better define the relationships observed.
    - Confidence: Most insights are presented with a confidence rating of 3 or 4 stars, indicating moderate to high confidence in the findings. However, some insights have lower confidence (2 stars) or no confidence rating (N/A), suggesting areas where further research is needed or where the findings are more speculative.

- **Marker**: FGF21 levels
    - Change: 5-10 fold increase in FGF21 transgenic mice; approximately doubled (156 to 358.5 pg/mL) from age 5 to 80 in humans; higher in obese individuals (positive correlation with BMI)
    - Context: Genetic engineering of C57 black 6j mice; observational study across a wide age range in humans; observational study in healthy controls and type 2 diabetics
    - Timeframe: Lifespan for mice; cross-sectional for human studies
    - Effects: Increased levels observed in genetically engineered mice, aging humans, and obese individuals
    - Limitations: Observational studies in humans limit causal inference
    - Confidence: 3-4 stars

- **Marker**: Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
    - Context: MCV is a marker of red blood cell size, which tends to increase with age. A centenarian woman had a high MCV of 100.8 fL, while values around 88 fL are found in biological youth. Data from 36,000 subjects suggests a reference range of 89.2-91.6 for lower all-cause mortality, with Paul Saladino's level at 83.7. One individual observed a decrease in MCV from 94.7 fL to 93.5 fL, potentially linked to increased cocoa bean intake.
    - Effects: Higher MCV values are associated with increased mortality risk, while lower levels in the youthful range are associated with lower all-cause mortality. Increased cocoa bean intake may be significantly correlated with lower MCV, potentially contributing to more youthful values.
    - Limitations: Timeframes for changes and associations varied across observations, ranging from a single measurement to 49 days and recent changes. One observation was specific to a centenarian woman, which may not generalize to the broader population. The link between cocoa bean intake and MCV is based on observation and correlation, not necessarily causation.
    - Confidence: 2-4 (Varied across individual insights)

    - Change: Varied: 100.8 fL (high in centenarian), decrease from 94.7 fL to 93.5 fL, moved towards youthful values, lower levels associated with lower mortality.

- **Marker**: Liver enzymes ALT and AST
    - Context: Liver enzymes, with lower levels of AST and ALT generally considered favorable within the healthy range. Data derived from personal (N=1) analysis spanning 3+ years, supplemented by observations over shorter durations (49 and 63 days).
    - Effects: Lower levels of AST were associated with increased intake of strawberries, mushrooms, and cocoa beans. The combined levels of ALT and AST improved (moved in the right direction relative to initial higher values) over 49 days, potentially linked to increased peanut intake, which is inversely correlated with the sum of ALT and AST.
    - Limitations: Single individual (N=1) data analysis, making it difficult to generalize findings to a broader population.

- **Marker**: Homocysteine
    - Context: Homocysteine is an amino acid that increases with age and is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. It serves as an indicator of methylation status and cardiovascular health.
    - Effects: Increased to 11 µmol/L (average of previous 15 tests was 10.4 µmol/L) over 49 days despite increasing dietary methyl donors. Decreased from 10.5 µmol/L to 9.6 µmol/L over a 49-day period after the introduction of oranges (proline betaine) and chickpeas (trigonelline). Lower levels were associated with higher carrot intake, while higher levels were associated with higher mushroom intake over 63 days. Increased to the highest level in 3 years over 42 days; negatively correlated with B12 intake (r = -0.65, p < 0.05, n = 20) and date intake (r = -0.85, n = 13). Reduced by approximately 20% with methyl B12 supplementation. Increased from 10 to 10.8 µmol/L after at least 39 days of 2g/day glycine supplementation. Not impacted by BCAA supplementation over 14 days. Currently trending upwards, with a goal to lower by limiting omega-6 intake and monitoring the effect of B12 removal. Serine and Vitamin B6 supplementation were implemented to potentially reduce homocysteine levels.
    - Limitations: Some interventions, like increased carrot intake, were not followed due to other concerns (beta-carotene). The effect of serine and Vitamin B6 supplementation is yet to be measured. BCAA supplementation did not show an impact on homocysteine levels.

- **Collection**: A comprehensive overview of various health markers, their changes, optimal ranges, and associations with aging, mortality, and other health outcomes.
    - Context: The data presented comes from a variety of sources, including large-scale observational studies, longitudinal studies like the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), clinical trials, and personal data from individuals tracking their health metrics. Some data is derived from specific populations, such as centenarians or individuals with coronary artery disease, while other data is drawn from the general population. Specific interventions mentioned include dietary changes, tree planting initiatives, and the use of near-infrared (NIR) light therapy
    - Effects: Numerous health markers are associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease risk, and other health outcomes. Lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Triglycerides, and Glucose are generally associated with better health outcomes. Conversely, higher levels of Albumin, Lymphocytes, and in some cases, HDL Cholesterol are associated with positive outcomes. Biological age, as measured by Levine's Phenotypic Age and Aging.ai, is consistently lower than chronological age in individuals who track these markers. Interventions such as dietary changes (e.g., yogurt consumption, modified fat and protein intake), increased physical activity, and environmental factors (e.g., greenspace exposure) can influence these markers. Specific triglycerides, cholesterol esters and lifestyle also plays role in health and longevity. Rapamycin may reduce CRP levels in humans. The Horvath clock (epigenetic age) can be improved by lifestyle changes
    - Limitations: Much of the data is observational, making it difficult to establish causality. Some data is based on personal tracking, which may not be generalizable to the broader population. The effects of some markers may vary depending on age, sex, and underlying health conditions. Some associations, such as those between HDL and mortality, may be complex and not always consistent across studies. Optimal ranges for some markers may need further refinement. Further research is needed to confirm and better define the relationships observed.
    - Confidence: Most insights are presented with a confidence rating of 3 or 4 stars, indicating moderate to high confidence in the findings. However, some insights have lower confidence (2 stars) or no confidence rating (N/A), suggesting areas where further research is needed or where the findings are more speculative.

Observed in personal data (speaker taking 137.5 mcg/day levothyroxine), large observational studies (83,000+ individuals and multiple other studies), and personal experiments with selenium supplementation (400 mcg/day).
    - Effects: Decreases with age from approximately 0.35-0.38 in youth to 0.31-0.32 by age 90, and further to 0.2 in centenarians. A ratio below 0.45 is associated with increased mortality risk. In centenarians, a ratio of 0.18 was associated with shorter survival compared to 0.24. Free T4 decreases from approximately 13.25-13.5 pmol/L in youth to 12.5 pmol/L around age 50-60, then increases to around original levels by age 90. The speaker's ratio decreased from 0.3 in October 2022 to 0.18 in April 2024 over an 18-month period and is the lowest over 5 tests in 2024. Attempts to increase the ratio with increased selenium showed mixed results: one instance showed an increase from 1.64 to 2.92 over two weeks potentially due to Brazil nut intake, while another ongoing experiment has shown no change yet.
    - Limitations: Some insights are based on personal data (n=1) and ongoing experiments. Observational studies may have confounding factors. Different measurement units (e.g., ratio vs pmol/L) and different ratios (T3/T4 vs Free T3/Free T4) are used across studies, which may complicate direct comparisons.
    - Confidence: Weighted Average: ~2.8 Stars. Individual confidences: 4 stars (personal data), 3 stars (large observational study, multiple observational studies), 2 stars (current ratio, selenium intervention, short-term selenium impact).
    - Timeframe: Observations span from two weeks to decades, including an 18-month period for personal data and ongoing experiments.

- **Marker**: NAD+
    - Context: Various studies and self-experiments investigating the effects of different interventions on NAD+ levels, both in vitro and in vivo, including human cell cultures, mice, rats, and human subjects. Interventions included trigonelline, apigenin, quercetin, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract, NMN, nicotinic acid, vitamin B6, tryptophan, and dietary sources like clover sprouts and other trigonelline-rich foods. Measurements were taken in various tissues including muscle cells, liver, kidney, blood, and urine.
    - Effects: NAD+ levels have been shown to increase dose-dependently with trigonelline supplementation in human muscle cells in vitro. In vivo studies in mice showed significant increases in NAD+ in liver, muscle, kidney, and blood after trigonelline gavage, alongside increased plasma and urine trigonelline levels. Apigenin and quercetin increased intracellular NAD+ levels and decreased CD38 activity in vitro. A four-fold increase in liver NAD+ was observed in rats with grape seed proanthocyanidin extract. Human studies showed mixed results with various interventions: NMN supplementation increased intracellular NAD+; nicotinic acid showed increases in some cases but not others, with one instance of levels returning to baseline after cessation; vitamin B6 showed both increases and decreases in NAD+ levels depending on dosage; and some studies showed no change or even decreases in NAD+ with trigonelline, niacin combined with tryptophan, or grape seed powder. High doses of clover sprouts decreased NAD+ levels after an initial increase at a lower dose. One individual reported a negative outcome on the Dunedin Pace of Aging test with niacin and tryptophan supplementation despite low baseline NAD+ levels.
    - Limitations: Many studies are in vitro or in animal models, with limited human data. Several findings are from self-experiments with single individuals, which may not be generalizable. Some studies lack specific timeframes or dosage details. Different methodologies for measuring NAD+ and varying baseline levels may contribute to inconsistent results. The bioavailability and metabolism of the interventions may vary across individuals and species.
    - Confidence: Ranges from 1 to 4 ⭐, with most studies rated at 2 or 3 ⭐. Higher confidence (4 ⭐) for in vivo mouse studies with trigonelline and in vitro studies with trigonelline on human muscle cells.
