- **Finding**: Calorie restriction (CR) and fasting, particularly when aligned with circadian rhythms, significantly extend lifespan and improve healthspan in mice. CR ranging from 20% to 40% has been shown to increase both median and maximum lifespan, with a 40% CR also improving physical activity. A 20% CR extended average lifespan in female mice from 25 to 36 months and maximum lifespan from 33 to 45 months. Fasting alone, even without CR, such as one day per week, can extend lifespan, and two days of fasting per week with moderate CR shows comparable results. Combining CR with fasting yields further benefits: 30% CR with a 22-hour fast increased median lifespan by 20%, while aligning feeding with the night (circadian alignment) during a 12 or 22-hour fast increased it by 35%. However, spreading 30% CR across nine meals without prolonged fasting only increased median lifespan by 10%, and consuming all food within a 2-hour window decreased it by 9%. A low Advanced Glycation End-product (AGE) diet has also been shown to increase both average and maximal lifespan, reduce body weight without reducing food intake, and improve metabolism in male mice. Conversely, a high AGE diet shortened the lifespan of calorie-restricted mice. Severe CR (around 50%) historically showed the largest lifespan extension, but such studies are difficult to replicate and raise ethical concerns.
    - Context: Multiple studies on C57 black 6J mice, including both male and female subjects, examining the effects of varying degrees of calorie restriction, fasting durations, and dietary AGE content on lifespan and health markers. Some studies compared ad libitum feeding to different CR and fasting protocols, while others focused on the impact of low vs. high AGE diets.
    - Effects: Observed improvements in median and maximum lifespan, physical activity, and metabolic health. Effects on lifespan were noted across various CR levels and fasting durations, with the most significant increases observed when CR was combined with circadian-aligned fasting. Low AGE diets improved lifespan and metabolic markers, while high AGE diets negatively impacted lifespan in CR mice.
    - Limitations: Majority of studies were conducted on mice, limiting direct translation to humans. Some studies only included male mice, and the severity of CR in some older studies raises ethical concerns and makes replication difficult.

- **Finding**: Methionine restriction extends both median and maximum lifespan in mice and rats, including a progeria mouse model.
    - Context: Controlled diet studies in male and female mice and rats. In mice, the control group received 0.43% methionine, while the restricted group received 0.15% methionine (65% reduction). In rats, the control group received 0.86% methionine, while the restricted group received 0.17% methionine (80% reduction). One study involved a progeria mouse model (G609G). Methionine restriction also increased cholic acid levels in the liver in one mouse study.
    - Effects: In mice, methionine restriction increased median lifespan by 6.6% in one study and 7% in another. In the progeria mouse model, median lifespan increased by 20%. In rats, median lifespan increased by 29% and maximum lifespan increased by 12%. Maximum lifespan also increased in mice, although the increase was not statistically significant in the progeria model (p=0.08).
    - Limitations: Mouse and rat studies; direct translation to humans is unknown. Some studies only looked at liver levels of cholic acid. Long-term effects on other health parameters were not fully explored in all studies.

- **Protocol**: Supplementation with Nicotinic Acid (NA), Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), and Trigonelline to affect NAD+ levels.
    - Context: The majority of these insights are derived from case studies involving a single individual (male) aiming to optimize NAD+ levels. Different dosages and durations of supplementation were explored for each substance. NAD+ levels were measured using intracellular blood tests.
    - Effects: Nicotinic Acid (NA) showed varied effects on NAD+ levels depending on dosage. Doses of 50-60 mg/day and 600 mg/day consistently increased NAD+ levels, with one instance reaching 67 micromolar at 600 mg/day. However, at 60 mg/day, NA achieved a similar increase (38 micromolar) to 1000 mg/day of NMN. Lower doses of NA (27-45 mg/day) showed no increase. NMN at 300 mg/day did not significantly change NAD+ levels, but 1000 mg/day increased levels from ~25 to 39.3 micromolar. Trigonelline, at 51 mg/day (with 45 mg/day NA) and 500 mg/day, did not increase NAD+ levels.
    - Limitations: All studies are based on single individuals, limiting generalizability. Many are self-reported with varying dosages and durations. The effects of higher doses may have negative effects (e.g. worst epigenetic pace of aging with 600 mg/day of NA). The effect of trigonelline alone was not assessed.

- **Marker**: Albumin
    - Change: Declines with age, with levels decreasing from 4.2 in younger groups to 3.2 in supercentenarians. Maintained at high youthful levels, targeting 4.8-4.9 g/dL may be beneficial.
    - Context: General population, with data from 1.7 million subjects and analysis of individuals aged 85+, including centenarians and supercentenarians. Observational studies show an association between albumin levels and mortality risk. Albumin is an important protein that reflects long-term health status and is malleable with diet.
    - Effects: Higher albumin levels are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk. Youthful levels (46 g/L or 4.6 g/dL) are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Optimal range may be ≥ 4.4-4.5 g/L.
    - Limitations: Some data is from observational studies, which show associations but not necessarily causation.
    - Confidence: 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Tags: #albumin #aging #mortality #longevity #healthmarker #diet #risk #reduction
    - Timeframe: Lifetime, with ongoing monitoring and adjustment.

- **Marker**: Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
    - Change: Levels above 48 U/L may indicate higher LPS levels or other issues. Levels of 34 U/L from a single blood test are not associated with increased all-cause mortality. Optimal levels are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
    - Context: ALP in the blood can dephosphorylate and inactivate LPS. A meta-analysis of 9 million people found the lowest all-cause mortality risk at around 48 U/L. Levels below 48 U/L not associated with increased all-cause mortality.
    - Timeframe: Not specified for optimal levels, single blood test for 34 U/L.

- **Marker**: HDL and Total Cholesterol
    - Change: HDL increased from an average of 44.7 mg/dL (43 tests) to ≥50 mg/dL (12 consecutive tests), with a current value of 63 mg/dL. Total cholesterol is at 133 mg/dL (most recent test). HDL has ranged from 34 to 56 mg/dL over 32 tests in 6 years.
    - Context: HDL increase observed after implementation of unspecified interventions. Total cholesterol of 133 mg/dL is associated with >2-fold increased all-cause mortality risk in the general population but potentially mitigated by high albumin and HDL in this individual. HDL is slightly below the "youthful" phenotype threshold (47 mg/dL) when combined with low total cholesterol and high albumin. HDL levels above 50 mg/dL are associated with lower hs-CRP in a self-experiment where HDL was significantly negatively correlated with hs-CRP.
    - Timeframe: HDL improvement observed over approximately 2 years. Total cholesterol is a single measurement. HDL and hs-CRP correlation measured over 32 blood tests spanning 6 years.
    - Confidence: 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (HDL increase) | 3 ⭐⭐⭐ (Total cholesterol, HDL/hs-CRP correlation, youthful phenotype)

- **Marker**: Biological Age Assessments
    - Context: Multiple biological age assessments were conducted using Levine's Phenotypic Age model and Aging.ai 3.0, both derived from blood test biomarkers. Levine's model incorporates chronological age and 9 biomarkers, while Aging.ai 3.0 uses 19 biomarkers without chronological age. PhenoAge calculations are consistently lower than chronological age, indicating a favorable biological age.
    - Effects: Levine's Phenotypic Age showed a statistically significant reduction from an average of 35.6 years (2020-2021) to 34.0 years in 2022 (p=0.04), with a most recent measurement of 32.2 years. The average reduction in 2022 was 15.2 years relative to chronological age. Aging.ai 3.0 showed a stable average of around 30 years, with a most recent measurement of 28 years and an average of 28.5 years in 2022. PhenoAge consistently indicated a biological age approximately 15-17 years younger than chronological age, although one test showed a worsening of ~5 years compared to the previous average.
    - Limitations: While both models indicate a lower biological age, the specific calculations and included biomarkers differ. Results can vary between tests.
    - Confidence: 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Levine's and Aging.ai); 3 ⭐⭐⭐ (PhenoAge, longitudinal data); 2 ⭐⭐ (Speaker's data)
    - Tags: #healthmarker #biologicalage #phenotypicage #levine #agingai #longitudinal #phenoage #aging #biomarker #health-marker #biological-age #worsening #stable #reduction

- **Marker**: Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL)
    - Change: Generally declines with age in various populations, but individual tracking has shown potential for increase. In one case, LTL increased from an average of 7.04 kilobases in 2022 (3 tests) to 7.14 kilobases in 2023 (7 tests), a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05). However, recent tests for this individual (3 of the last 5) showed declines to 7.06-7.08 kb. The overall average was 7.05 kb in 2022 (3 tests), 7.13 kb in 2023 (8 tests), and 7.12 kb in 2024 (data up to May).
    - Context: Observational studies in European, US, and Israeli cohorts, as well as individual self-experimentation using blood samples measured via "a simple true diagnostic test". The goal in individual tracking is to approach youthful levels (around 7.75 kb).
    - Timeframe: Measured across the lifespan in observational studies. Individual data spans from 2022 to May 28, 2024, with ongoing monitoring. An update is expected in September.

- **Marker**: Cholesterol and All-Cause Mortality
    - Context: General population and observational studies on older adults, including centenarians and supercentenarians.
    - Effects: HDL Cholesterol declines with age. Levels less than 45 mg/dL in men and 55 mg/dL in women are associated with increased all-cause mortality. HDL remained relatively stable (around 50s) until 105, then decreased to 44-45 in semi-supercentenarians and supercentenarians. This decrease from 50s to 40s is associated with a small increase in mortality risk in women but not men. The lowest risk for all-cause mortality was observed with total cholesterol between 210-240 mg/dL in older adults (75-99 years). A significantly increased risk was found with total cholesterol around 160 mg/dL in centenarians, with an average of 153 mg/dL measured at ages 111.5, 113.3, and 115.7. However, high albumin and HDL mitigate this risk.
    - Limitations: Some data is from observational studies, and the timeframe for the HDL decrease to 44-45 was not specified.
    - Confidence: 3.5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Tags: #HDL #aging #mortality #cholesterol #albumin #totalcholesterol
    - Change: HDL Cholesterol declines with age, particularly after 105. Total Cholesterol levels associated with lowest mortality risk are higher in older adults, but low levels in centenarians may increase risk if not mitigated by high albumin and HDL.

Levels consistently below 0.3 mg/L or 0.3 mg/dL have been observed in multiple individuals. Elevated hs-CRP levels can indicate inflammation, potentially due to infection or microbial burden. One individual aimed to decrease their hs-CRP level from 1.01 mg/L to 0.27 mg/L by increasing HDL levels. Another individual's CRP decreased with higher saturated fat intake. CRP levels tend to increase with age, with a more than fivefold increase in men and a threefold increase in women.
    - Limitations: The timeframe for some data points is not specified. The precise duration of consistently low measurements is not always clear. For some individuals, only a single measurement or a general trend is reported.

    - Context: LPS is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. LBP circulates in the blood and binds to LPS.
    - Timeframe: Not specified, but LPS can be acutely elevated after events like ultra-endurance exercise or a high-fat meal.
    - Limitations: Measurement of LPS can be challenging due to variability in the assay and binding to lipoproteins.
    - Confidence: 2 ⭐⭐

- **Marker**: NAD+ (Intracellular)
    - Context: Self-experiments involving the consumption of trigonelline-rich foods, including clover sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, green peas, snow peas, and fenugreek seeds. One experiment involved consuming 121g of clover sprouts daily for 9 days, another involved 271g of clover sprouts daily for 11 days, and a third involved increased trigonelline intake through diet for 49 days.
    - Effects: Consuming 121g of clover sprouts daily for 9 days resulted in an increase in intracellular NAD+ from a baseline of 18.5-26.6 µM to 29.6 µM. However, a higher dose of 271g of clover sprouts daily for 11 days resulted in a decrease to 19 µM. Results from a 49-day dietary intervention are pending.
    - Limitations: Results are based on self-experiments and may not be generalizable. Long-term effects are unknown.
    - Confidence: 2 ⭐⭐
