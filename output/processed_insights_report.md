    - Timeframe: Long-term trend over 9 years.
    - Confidence: 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #RDW #red-blood-cells #aging #mortality

- **Marker**: Lymphocytes
    - Change: Significant age-related decline over 9 years in the speaker's data.
    - Context: Speaker's personal data, despite efforts to maintain youthful levels.
    - Timeframe: Long-term trend over 9 years.
    - Confidence: 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #lymphocytes #aging #decline

- **Marker**: Blood lead levels
    - Change: One standard deviation increase in blood lead levels.
    - Context: Associated with a nearly 5-year older biological age.
    - Timeframe: Not specified
    - Confidence: 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #biomarker #aging #lead

- **Marker**: All-cause mortality
    - Change: 48% increased risk in women, 22% in men
    - Context: Associated with relatively higher blood lead levels.
    - Timeframe: Median follow-up of 7 years (first study), 19 years (second study)
    - Confidence: 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #mortality #lead

- **Marker**: All-cause mortality
    - Change: Significantly increased risk for blood lead levels > 8 µg/dL
    - Context: Used as an index of daily physical activity; no significant change observed between test periods.
    - Timeframe: 49 days
    - Confidence: 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #ADHR #activity #physicalactivity
    - **Marker**: Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR)
    - Change**: Decreased from 57 bpm (Test 1, 42 days) to 56.2 bpm (Test 2, 49 days) - not statistically significant.

- **Marker**: Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
    - Change: Not quantified, but stated to be low.
    - Context: The speaker hypothesizes that low NAD levels may be limiting DHEA production.
    - Timeframe: Single blood test.
    - Confidence: 2 ⭐⭐ | Tags: #dhea #hormones #nad #aging
    - **Marker**: DHEA Sulfate

- **Marker**: Creatinine
    - Change: Relatively stable across age groups, slightly increasing and then decreasing, but remaining within the reference range.
    - Context: Observational study; stable levels may be due to counteracting effects of decreased kidney function and decreased muscle mass.
    - Timeframe: Not specified.
    - Confidence: 2 ⭐⭐ | Tags: #creatinine #kidneyfunction #musclemass #aging

- **Marker**: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
    - Change: Decreased from 30.1 µM to 22.3 µM after increasing average daily vitamin B6 intake from 11.3 mg/day to 37.2 mg/day. Other measured levels were 25.6 µM and 25.3 µM while intaking 3.2 mg/day of vitamin B6.
    - Context: Self-experiment with one participant. NAD levels were measured using blood tests from Infinity.
    - Timeframe: 32 days for the period of 37.2 mg/day vitamin B6 intake.
    - Confidence: 1 ⭐ | Tags: #health-marker #NAD #aging #biomarker
    - **Marker**: NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
    - Change**: 3.23 years younger in the treatment group compared to controls. 1.96 years younger within the treatment group, but this was not statistically significant.
