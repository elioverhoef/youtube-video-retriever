## Executive Summary

This transcript analyzes the blood test data of supercentenarian Jirahiman, focusing on the last four years of his life (age 112-116). While his uric acid levels were close to optimal for longevity, most other biomarkers indicated a decline in health. Notably, his liver function markers (GOT, GPT, gamma-GTP, and cholinesterase) were suboptimal, suggesting compromised liver health. His hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet levels were also low, associated with increased all-cause mortality. Total cholesterol was low, which, combined with low albumin, pointed to higher mortality risk rather than youthful lipid profiles. Despite these negative indicators, Jirahiman's glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, white blood cells, and initial CRP levels were in the healthy range, highlighting their potential importance for longevity. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

This transcript explores the impact of trigonelline-rich foods, specifically clover sprouts, on NAD+ levels. The presenter conducts a self-experiment, increasing his intake of clover sprouts significantly between two tests. Surprisingly, the higher intake leads to a substantial decrease in NAD+ levels compared to the initial test, which showed a potential increase. This raises questions about the optimal dosage of trigonelline for NAD+ optimization and whether the initial increase was merely random variation or influenced by residual nicotinic acid intake. The presenter also discusses the limitations of self-experimentation and the need for further research, potentially involving coffee, another trigonelline source. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

This transcript features an in-depth discussion with Dr. Michael Lustgarten, a scientist focused on longevity and biohacking. He outlines his personal journey towards optimizing health markers and potentially extending lifespan beyond current records. His approach involves meticulous tracking of diet, fitness, sleep, and a wide array of biomarkers, including blood, epigenetic, and microbiome data. Key findings include the significant impact of dietary composition on biomarker profiles, the importance of personalized exercise titration guided by wearable data, and the challenges of optimizing sleep despite rigorous tracking and interventions. Dr. Lustgarten's strategy emphasizes a holistic, data-driven methodology, aiming to minimize negative correlations and maximize positive ones across all measured health parameters. This approach reveals the malleability of many biomarkers and underscores the importance of individualized health optimization. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Quick Reference

*   **Low total cholesterol (153 mg/dL) + low albumin (3.3 g/L) = high mortality risk.**
*   **Suboptimal liver function:** Elevated GOT (29), GPT (14.7), gamma-GTP (41), and low cholinesterase (199 IU/L).
*   **Low hemoglobin (12.1 g/dL), hematocrit (37.7%), and platelets (173.7k/µL) = increased mortality risk.**
*   **Near-optimal uric acid (4.43 mg/dL) may be a positive longevity factor.**
*   **Good glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, WBC, and initial CRP may be crucial for longevity despite other declining markers.** _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

*   Increased clover sprout intake from 121g/day to 271g/day resulted in decreased NAD+ levels (29.6 µM to 19 µM).
*   The potential NAD+ increase from lower clover sprout intake (121g/day) might be due to random variation or residual nicotinic acid.
*   Baseline NAD+ range without precursors (nicotinic acid or NMN) is 18.5-26.6 µM over 7 tests.
*   Complete removal of nicotinic acid for 9 days prior to the second test resulted in one of the lowest NAD+ measurements (19 µM).
*   Coffee is considered a potential source of trigonelline for future experiments, but would require eliminating green tea to maintain caffeine neutrality. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

-   **Diet:** ~40% fat (including fiber), ~40% net carbs, ~18% protein for optimal biomarker profile.
-   **Exercise:** 80-minute workouts, compound movements, calisthenics, low-intensity cardio, titrated based on HRV and resting heart rate.
-   **Sleep:** Strict sleep hygiene, early eating window (1 PM or 3 PM), blackout curtains, earplugs, but deep sleep optimization remains a challenge.
-   **Body Weight:** Aiming for 6% body fat (currently 8-9%), potentially contributing to improvements in epigenetic age (DunedinPACE).
-   **Key Biomarker:** Lipoprotein(a) reduced by 50% through dietary adjustments.
-   **Epigenetics:**  DunedinPACE improved with body fat reduction; Horvath clock near chronological age, once as high as 56.
-   **Hormones:** Monitoring DHEA-sulfate, aiming to reverse age-related decline.
-   **Data Tracking:** Uses a spreadsheet to track blood test results, dietary intake, fitness metrics, and sleep data since 2015.
-   **Methodology:** Calculate correlations between diet and biomarkers after each blood test, then adjust diet to move biomarkers in a favorable direction.
-   **Philosophy:** Track, test, and track. Don't rely on hope, but on your own data. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_

Optimal biomarker profile associated with ~40% fat (including fiber as short-chain fatty acids), ~40% net carbs, and ~18% protein.
High fat intake (>40%) associated with negative shifts in multiple biomarkers.
Dietary changes can significantly alter Lipoprotein(a) levels, a biomarker previously thought to be primarily genetically determined.

<summary><h2>Supplements</h2></summary>

Nicotinic acid (a form of Vitamin B3) was removed completely for 9 days prior to the second NAD+ test. Average intake of 20mg/day of nicotinic acid was recorded in the onee period prior to testing, for the first test.
 No specific supplement protocol mentioned in the transcript. Emphasis is placed on dietary interventions.
