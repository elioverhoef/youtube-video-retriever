## Executive Summary

This transcript analyzes the blood test data of supercentenarian Jirahiman, focusing on biomarkers tracked between ages 112 and 116. The analysis reveals a complex picture: while some markers like uric acid were near optimal, many others, including liver function markers, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and total cholesterol, indicated elevated all-cause mortality risk. Notably, Jirahiman's low total cholesterol, combined with low albumin, suggests increased risk rather than a youthful profile. However, his good glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, and some inflammatory markers may have played a protective role, highlighting their potential importance for longevity. The analysis largely relies on observational studies comparing Jirahiman's data to established all-cause mortality risk associations. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

This transcript details a personal experiment aimed at increasing Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) levels through dietary intake of trigonelline-rich foods, specifically clover sprouts. The experiment involves self-testing NAD+ levels after consuming varying amounts of clover sprouts over several days. The main finding is that doubling the intake of clover sprouts from 12.1g to 27.1g per day did not increase, but rather decreased NAD+ levels from 29.6 µM to 19 µM. This unexpected result raises questions about the optimal dose of trigonelline for boosting NAD+ and suggests that a lower dose might be more effective or that the initial increase might have been due to random variation or residual effects of prior nicotinic acid supplementation. The individual is a slow caffeine metabolizer and is considering a future experiment with coffee, another source of trigonelline. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

This transcript features Dr. Michael Lustgarten, a scientist with a personal mission to achieve exceptional longevity, meticulously tracking and optimizing his health. He employs a comprehensive approach involving diet, exercise, sleep, and biomarker monitoring, including advanced metrics like epigenetics and oral microbiome. His dietary strategy focuses on macronutrient balance tailored to his individual biomarker responses, while his fitness regimen emphasizes compound movements, flexibility, and careful monitoring of recovery metrics. Notably, he uses his biomarker data to fine-tune his lifestyle, adjusting his diet and exercise based on correlative data. He identifies sleep optimization as crucial but challenging, despite implementing rigorous sleep hygiene practices. He regrets not tracking hormone levels earlier, especially DHEA sulfate, which shows a declining trend. His approach highlights the potential for individual malleability in biomarkers, even those considered genetically determined, like lipoprotein(a). _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Quick Reference

*   **Elevated Mortality Risk:** Low albumin, low total cholesterol, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, low platelets, high AST/ALT ratio, high gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and low cholinesterase.
*   **Near Optimal:** Uric acid levels were close to optimal for lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Potential Protective Factors:** Good glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, and some inflammatory markers (from Part 1) may have mitigated some risks.
*   **Liver Function:** Four markers (GOT, GPT, GGT, cholinesterase) collectively suggested suboptimal liver health.
*   **Kidney Function:** Suboptimal kidney function was noted in Part 1, potentially linked to uric acid levels. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

*   **Clover sprout intake (27.1g/day) decreased NAD+ levels to 19 µM.**
*   **Lower dose of clover sprouts (12.1g/day) potentially increased NAD+ to 29.6 µM, but this could be due to other factors.**
*   **Nicotinic acid was completely removed 9 days before the second test to eliminate its potential influence.**
*   **Coffee is being considered as an alternative source of trigonelline for a future experiment.** _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

*   **Finding:** Consuming 27.1g of clover sprouts daily for 11 days resulted in a decrease in NAD+ levels to 19 µM.
    *   **Context:** This was part of a self-experiment to test the effects of trigonelline-rich foods on NAD+ levels. The individual's baseline NAD+ range without precursors is 18.5-26.6 µM.
    *   **Confidence:** 2⭐⭐ | Tags: #diet #NAD+ #trigonelline #clover sprouts #self-experiment
*   **Finding:** Consuming 12.1g of clover sprouts daily for 9 days potentially increased NAD+ levels to 29.6 µM.
    *   **Context:** This was an earlier part of the same self-experiment. However, the individual had also been consuming 20mg/day of nicotinic acid, which could have influenced the results.
    *   **Confidence:** 2⭐⭐ | Tags: #diet #NAD+ #trigonelline #clover sprouts #nicotinic acid #self-experiment
*   **Finding:**  There is a hypothesis that lower doses of trigonelline may be more effective for increasing NAD+ levels, but this is not yet confirmed.
    *   **Context:** Based on the contradictory results of the two clover sprout experiments. It suggests that higher amounts are not necessarily better.
    *   **Confidence:** 1⭐ | Tags: #diet #NAD+ #trigonelline #dosage #hypothesis
*   **Finding:** Coffee is a potential source of trigonelline, but the experimenter is hesitant due to being a slow caffeine metabolizer and needing to eliminate green tea intake.
    *   **Context:** Coffee is being considered for future experiments based on the list of foods high in trigonelline.
    *   **Confidence:** 1⭐ | Tags: #diet #NAD+ #trigonelline #coffee #caffeine #green tea
*   **Finding:** No specific dietary data is available for Jirahiman.
*   **Context:** A hypothesis is presented that Jirahiman may have had a relatively low intake of dietary precursors that can be degraded to form uric acid. This could explain why his uric acid was not correspondingly elevated despite signs of suboptimal kidney function in Part 1 of the series.
*   **Limitations:** No published studies exist on Jirahiman's diet to verify this hypothesis.
*   **Confidence:** 1⭐ (Expert Opinion, based on hypothesis) | Tags: #diet #uricacid #kidneyfunction #hypothesis

## Scientific Methods

*   **Study Type:** Observational
*   **Methodology:** Jirahiman's blood test data (3 data points at ages 111.5, 113.3, and 115.7) was compared to data from various observational studies, predominantly those reporting hazard ratios for all-cause mortality based on biomarker levels. The largest and most representative studies for each biomarker were selected.
*   **Key Findings:** Jirahiman's biomarker profile showed a mix of near-optimal (uric acid) and suboptimal (liver function markers, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, total cholesterol) values associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Limitations:** Observational studies can demonstrate associations but not causation. The analysis relies on comparing Jirahiman's data to averages from other populations, which may not perfectly reflect his individual physiology.
*   **Confidence:** 3⭐⭐⭐ (Mainly observational studies) | Tags: #observational #biomarkers #allcausemortality #methodology
*   **Study Type:** Case Study
    - **Methodology:** Continuous self-tracking of diet (since 2015), fitness metrics (since \~2018), sleep, and blood biomarkers (since 2008, more frequently in recent years). Calculation of correlations between dietary components (macro and micronutrients, individual foods) and blood biomarkers after each test. Adjustment of diet to optimize biomarker profile based on correlation data.
    - **Key Findings:** Identification of individual-specific dietary composition associated with optimal biomarker profile. Demonstration of biomarker malleability, including lipoprotein(a).
    - **Limitations:** Single-subject study, potential for confounding factors, reliance on correlation rather than causation.
    - **Confidence:** 3⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #casestudy #self-experimentation #biomarkers #correlation #diet #longitudinal
*   **Study Type:** Case Study (Self-Experimentation)
    *   **Methodology:** The individual measured their intracellular NAD+ levels using blood tests after consuming different amounts of clover sprouts for a set number of days. They controlled for other potential NAD+ influencing factors like nicotinic acid supplementation.
    *   **Key Findings:** Increased intake of clover sprouts did not lead to increased NAD+ levels.
    *   **Limitations:** Single subject, potential for random variation, difficulty in isolating the effect of clover sprouts from other dietary factors, no control group. The experiment lacks a standardized protocol for measuring and controlling dietary intake.
