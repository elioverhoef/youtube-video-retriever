## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the blood biomarkers of supercentenarian Jirahiman, focusing on data from ages 112-116. While his uric acid levels were near optimal, most other markers, including liver function markers, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and total cholesterol, indicated increased all-cause mortality risk. Notably, his low total cholesterol, combined with low albumin, suggests a higher risk rather than a youthful profile. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting biomarkers in extreme aging and suggest that certain markers, like glucose, HbA1c, HDL, and triglycerides (covered in Part 1), might play crucial roles in longevity despite unfavorable levels in other areas. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

The transcript explores the impact of trigonelline-rich foods, specifically clover sprouts, on NAD+ levels. The experimenter doubled the intake of clover sprouts from 12.1g/day to 27.1g/day but observed a decrease in NAD+ levels from 29.6 µM to 19 µM. This raises questions about the optimal dosage of trigonelline for NAD+ increase and suggests that a lower dose might be more effective, or the initial increase was due to random variation or residual effects of prior nicotinic acid supplementation. The experimenter also considers coffee as a potential source of trigonelline but expresses hesitation due to the need to eliminate green tea to maintain caffeine neutrality. The experiment highlights the complexity of NAD+ metabolism and the need for further research to understand the effects of dietary trigonelline. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

Michael Lustgarten, a scientist and longevity enthusiast, has meticulously tracked his health and biological data since 2008, with the goal of living longer than anyone in history. His approach, summarized as "Conquer Aging or Die Trying," involves optimizing diet, physical activity, sleep, and body weight to influence a wide range of biomarkers, including epigenetic clocks. He uses a data-driven, iterative method to adjust his lifestyle, aiming for a holistic improvement in health markers rather than focusing on isolated parameters. His current diet is approximately 40% fat, 40% net carbs, and 18% protein. He is also aiming for a body fat percentage of around 6%. He uses fitness metrics to optimize training intensity and frequency. He prioritizes sleep hygiene, aiming for consistent sleep times, a dark, quiet environment, and an early eating window. His most surprising finding was the malleability of lipoprotein(a), which he significantly reduced through dietary changes. He believes that all biomarkers are malleable and aims to optimize them through a personalized, data-driven approach. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Quick Reference

-   **Low total cholesterol (153 mg/dL) combined with low albumin (3.3 g/dL) in Jirahiman was associated with increased mortality risk.**
-   **Jirahiman's liver function was likely suboptimal,** evidenced by elevated GOT, GPT, and GGT, alongside low cholinesterase.
-   **Hematocrit (37.7%) and hemoglobin (12.1 g/dL) were suboptimal,** indicating increased mortality risk.
-   **Uric acid levels (4.43 mg/dL) were close to optimal,** despite potential kidney dysfunction.
-   **Platelet count (173.7k/µL) was low,** correlating with increased mortality risk. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

*   **Clover sprouts** at 12.1g/day showed a potential (but not confirmed) increase in NAD+ levels to 29.6 µM.
*   **Doubling clover sprout intake** to 27.1g/day resulted in a significant decrease in NAD+ levels to 19 µM.
*   **Nicotinic acid** was removed 9 days before the second test to eliminate its potential impact on NAD+ levels.
*   **Coffee** is considered a potential source of trigonelline for future experiments but requires eliminating green tea intake.
*   Measuring NAD+ levels can be done via blood testing. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_
