## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the blood biomarkers of supercentenarian Jirahiman Kimura over the last four years of his life (age 112-116). While Jirahiman's uric acid levels were close to optimal, most other markers indicated increased all-cause mortality risk. Notably, his liver function markers (GOT, GPT, gamma-GTP, cholinesterase) were suboptimal, and his hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts were low. His total cholesterol was also low, which, combined with low albumin, suggests increased mortality risk rather than a youthful profile. Overall, the data paints a picture of declining health in Jirahiman's final years, despite his exceptional longevity. However, a few biomarkers like glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, and WBC from part one were in a good range, potentially highlighting their importance for longevity. _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

This transcript explores the impact of trigonelline, found in foods like crimson clover sprouts, on NAD+ levels. The experimenter increased his intake of clover sprouts to see if it would boost his NAD+ levels. However, contrary to the initial hypothesis, doubling the intake of clover sprouts from 12.1g to 27.1g per day resulted in a significant decrease in NAD+ levels, from 29.6 micromolar to 19 micromolar. This raises questions about the optimal dose of trigonelline and whether the initial slight increase was due to random variation or a residual effect of prior nicotinic acid intake. The experimenter also considers coffee as a potential source of trigonelline but expresses concerns due to his slow caffeine metabolism and the need to eliminate green tea from his diet for the experiment. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

Michael Lustgarten, a scientist with a background in nutrition, exercise physiology, and sarcopenia, has embarked on a personal mission to achieve super longevity, aiming to live longer than anyone in history. He meticulously tracks and optimizes his health through diet, physical activity, sleep, and body weight, alongside detailed biomarker monitoring. Over eight years, he has developed a comprehensive data-driven approach, adjusting his lifestyle based on correlative data from over 25 biomarkers, including a standard Chem panel, CBC, hs-CRP, epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE), telomere length, and oral microbiome. He also tracks fitness metrics (HRV, RHR, sleep) to optimize training and recovery. His diet, optimized through years of data analysis, consists of approximately 40% fat, 40% net carbs, and 18% protein, and he aims for a body fat percentage of around 6%. He is continuously refining his approach, aiming for an optimal balance that supports multiple health markers simultaneously. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Quick Reference

*   **Low total cholesterol (153 mg/dL) combined with low albumin (3.3 g/dL) is associated with increased mortality risk.**
*   **Suboptimal liver function was indicated by elevated GOT, GPT, gamma-GTP, and low cholinesterase.**
*   **Low hemoglobin (12.1 g/dL), hematocrit (37.7%), and platelets (173.7k/µL) suggest an aged phenotype and increased mortality risk.**
*   **Uric acid levels (4.43 mg/dL) were close to optimal for minimizing all-cause mortality.**
*   **Elevated globulin (3.73 g/dL) with low albumin is a negative health indicator.** _(Source: (Part_II)_Supercentenarian_(112_-_116y)_Blood_Test_Analysis)_

-   Increased clover sprout intake (27.1g/day) significantly reduced NAD+ levels (19 micromolar).
-   The optimal dose of trigonelline for increasing NAD+ levels remains unclear.
-   Coffee is a potential source of trigonelline but requires eliminating green tea to maintain caffeine neutrality.
-   The initial slight increase in NAD+ levels (29.6 micromolar) might be due to random variation or residual effects of nicotinic acid.
-   Baseline NAD+ range without precursors is 18.5-26.6 micromolar. _(Source: 2x_Trigonelline_Increase_Impact_on_NAD)_

*   **Diet:** 40% fat, 40% net carbs, 18% protein, aiming for the lowest body fat percentage possible (currently around 8-9%, with a goal of 6%).
*   **Exercise:** 80-minute workouts focusing on compound movements, calisthenics, taekwondo, mobility, balance, and flexibility, guided by HRV and RHR data to avoid overtraining.
*   **Sleep:** Consistent bedtime, blacked-out room, earplugs, limited eating window ending 6+ hours before bed to improve sleep quality.
*   **Key Biomarker:** DunedinPACE has shown improvement, potentially linked to body weight and body fat reduction.
*   **Primary Goal:** Achieve optimal balance across all tracked biomarkers, not just focusing on one or two at the expense of others.
*   **Methodology:** Continuous tracking and adjustment based on correlative data, aiming to follow all positive and minimize all negative correlations without focusing on any single intervention in isolation. _(Source: @everythingepigenetics_Podcast_Dr._Michael_Lustgarten)_


## Diet Insights

-   Finding: Increasing crimson clover sprout intake to 27.1g daily for 11 days resulted in a decrease in NAD+ levels to 19 micromolar.
    -   Context: The subject more than doubled the clover sprout intake to investigate the dose-response relationship with NAD+ levels.
    -   Timeframe: 11 days.
    -   Limitations: The reason for the decrease is unclear; a lower dose of trigonelline might be optimal.

    *   **Limitations:** Highly individualized; may not be directly applicable to others without similar data tracking and analysis. Represents correlative data, not necessarily causative.
    *   **Confidence:** 3 ⭐⭐⭐ | Tags: #diet #macronutrients #biomarkers #longevity #personalizednutrition
*   **Finding:** 40% fat, 40% net carbs, 18% protein.
    *   **Context:**  This specific macronutrient ratio is associated with the best overall biomarker profile for Michael. Fiber is included in the fat category as it's converted to short-chain fatty acids.
    *   **Timeframe:** Ongoing, with continuous adjustments based on data.
    *   **Limitations:** Individual results may vary. High fat intake (above 40%) has been associated with negative changes in other biomarkers for Michael.

-   Finding: Consuming 12.1g of crimson clover sprouts daily for 9 days potentially increased NAD+ levels to 29.6 micromolar.
    -   Context: This was part of a series of experiments to increase NAD+ levels through trigonelline-rich foods. The subject had a baseline NAD+ range of 18.5-26.6 micromolar without NAD+ precursors.
    -   Timeframe: 9 days.
    -   Limitations: The increase could be random variation or influenced by prior nicotinic acid intake (20mg/day).

- Finding: It is hypothesized that Jirahiman may have had a relatively low intake of dietary precursors that can be degraded to form uric acid.
    - Context: Jirahiman's uric acid was close to optimal despite potential kidney dysfunction, which usually leads to uric acid accumulation. Study on over 5,000 participants.
    - Timeframe: Not specified, assumed to be habitual diet.
    - Limitations: No published studies on Jirahiman's actual dietary intake exist to verify this hypothesis.
    - Confidence: 1 ⭐ | Tags: #diet #uricacid #kidneyfunction #purines

## Supplements

-   Protocol: Nicotinic acid (NAD+ precursor)
    -   Effects: Potentially contributed to the initial slight increase in NAD+ levels in the first experiment.
    -   Context: The subject had been consuming 20mg of nicotinic acid daily before the first experiment but eliminated it 4 days prior to testing.
    -   Limitations: It's possible that the residual effect of nicotinic acid influenced the NAD+ levels in the first test.

*   **Study Type:** Case Study/N-of-1 Experiment
    *   **Methodology:** Michael collects comprehensive data on his diet, fitness, sleep, and biomarkers. He calculates correlations between dietary components (macro and micronutrients, individual foods) and biomarkers after each blood test. He then adjusts his diet to follow all positive correlations and minimize negative ones, aiming for a net positive effect on his overall biomarker profile.
    *   **Key Findings:** This method has allowed him to identify a specific dietary composition and lifestyle factors associated with his most youthful biomarker profile. He has observed improvements in DunedinPACE, potentially linked to body weight and body fat reduction.
    *   **Limitations:** Results are specific to one individual. The approach is complex and requires significant effort and dedication. Correlation does not equal causation.
