Mean corpuscular body also on the list how does that change with age and also again a lot a lot of these biomarkers aren't well studied in terms of aging in terms of sample size that have looked sample sizes that have looked at that in studies so this is a relatively small sample but it has some it has some weight but before i go there to note the mean corpuscular volume is basically how swollen your red blood cells are they filled with fluid or are they smaller and have less fluid in them so the reference range is somewhat large 79 to 97% and what this data is presented in two ways so this is data from the baltimore longitudinal study in aging where they tracked subjects longitudinally repeated measures over time up to for 40 years or more so they had a small group of people who had multi measurements for up to four years 25 22 and 37 people what we're tracking them there is strength in the data because you're looking at the same person over time repeatedly and that ilustrate that you know why that's important in a minute so we're looking at the data longitudinally you see that the mcv and i mean compressed mean corpuscular volume it increases from 8.8 all the way up to 90 to 44 in old now looking at the data cross sectionally so just groups of young middle-aged year old that were not tracked longitudinally we see basically similar data mc the increases during aging so in looking at mortality risk in a relatively big study 36,000 subjects mortality risk for men and women lower mcd's which are found in biological youth are indeed associated with a lower risk of death for all causes and we see that here for the men lower ncv is as the reference and then higher mcd's are associated with a higher all cause mortality risk and similar findings for the women so for mcv lowers better so next on the list red blood cell distribution width which most people at least thought for me when i first got my blood testing we go to the dock you get your physical you get your rtw just gloss over it because it's nobody ever talks about clearly based on it being identified as one of the biomarkers on you know it's important for calculating biological age it's important so what is it so it's essentially the range of the distribution of your red blood cells in terms of are they you know filled excessively filled with fluid or not so in this case you have a low rtw because all the cells are approximately same the same size so the the standard deviation of the mcv which is how the rdw calculated is relatively small but when you have red blood cell populations that are very big and very small you have a larger range and that results in a larger rdw percent so what's optimal well it increases during the aging you see that here with the rdw percentage versus age lots of data points these are individual subject data so it's a big big sample size you can see that the rdw increases during age what about mortality risk so this is a data from about 30,000 subjects and all cause mortality risk on the y-axis and so we can see that the lowest risk of death for all causes is for rdw less than 12% and as you go higher each of these each of these plots are higher values of nc nc b so at least in terms of all cosmetologist in this study lowers better but we can go even bigger than this sample size of 30,000 subjects for mcb in this case they looked at more than 240,000 subjects but the same trend was identified using our d double use of less than rtw percentages of less than 12.5 as the reference you can see that higher rd w's is significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality but 240,000 subjects isn't the biggest study that's up to this there's actually study that looked at more than three million subjects and for that the lowest risk of death for all causes was for eight point one to 12.5% for the rdw whereas risks significantly increased above thirteen point one percent so for the rdw it would seem that lower is better so have some data that is moderately correlated with rdw whether it's a playable to everyone i don't know for me this may be a part of the story and how many calories i eat per day is moderately strong correlated without correlation coefficient zero point five with the rdw so because lower so higher calorie based on this point it would suggest that higher calorie intake would be associated with a higher rtw which is going in the wrong direction so i try to shoot for values twelve point five or less at least based on the last slide and to get there if you bring the plot forward it's somewhere in the 2400 to 2500 calorie range so right now i currently average somewhere in the load 2500 and my goal is to get it somewhere closer to here but one step at a time alright so this doesn't tell you what you know calories can come from anything so what what could be driving this what should i cut that in my calories you know what food groups should i cut and identified a moderate and strong correlation between my average daily fructose intake with the rdw so the higher my fruit taste fructose intake the higher my rtw of these based on this is plot so i don't drink sugary drinks or sodas that's almost well i should say not never but it's almost never so most of my fructose is coming from fruit and vegetables mostly from fruit though so nonetheless with the goal of if this correlation is in fact driving changes in rdw if i reduce my or keep my fructose levels relatively lower i'd expect to see lower rdw so with that in mind i've been shooting for the left side of this in terms of fructose intake so somewhere around 70 or even or even less
