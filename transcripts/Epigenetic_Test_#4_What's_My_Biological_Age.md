Epigenetic test number four what's my biological age in this video we'll go through data for three epigenetic tests hannum dunedin pace and horvath and these data were generated using true diagnostic so if you're interested in measuring your own epigenetic age there'll be a true diagnostic discount link in the video's description so a first question that we can ask is how good are these tests now in an earlier video for each epigenetic test i presented data for their correlations with chronological age and their associations with all cause mortality risk and if you missed that that data will be in the right corner in this video we'll focus on my data including what's good but also what's bad so let's start off by taking a look at data for hannah's epigenetic test so hannah's test is also known as extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or eea and this is a marker of immune system aging so for this most recent test in january of 2023 we can see that my hannum epigenetic age was 38.79 years years which is 11 years younger than my chronological now note that this is only data for one test how does this data for this one test compare with the previous three tests and that's what we can see here so for the first two tests i was 12 years younger than my chronological my worst data to date was on test number three ten years younger than my chronological and for a four test average for hannah's test of 38.3 years which is 10 to 12 years younger than my chronological age so this is relatively good news all right so next up let's take a look at the next epigenetic test dunedin pace now dunedin pace stands for the pace of aging calculated from the epigenome and dunedin is the dunedin study that these data were generated in so the dunedin is a city in new zealand so in the speedometer in front of us we can see two values 0.6 and 1.4 0.6 would be the slowest epigenetic aging rate and what that means is for that every one year of chronological age at genetic age increases by only 0.6 years conversely the fastest epigenetic rate would be 1.4 which means for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years so a faster epigenetic rate relatively older biological age so what's my data for test number four my dunedin pace value was 0.78 which means that for every one year of chronological age i'm epigenetically aging based on this metric by only 0.78 years now i do have room for improvement as knowing that 0.6 is the lowest so work in progress now just like we did for hanum how does this test compare with the previous three tests and that's what we can see here so for test one and two my dunedin pace value was relatively the same as test number four with values of 0.8 and 0.82 and then my worst data was also for test number three fourth dunedin pace as it was 0.89 going in the wrong direction relative to test one two and four so collectively these four tests yield a four test average of 0.82 for dunedin pace so for every one year of chronological age 0.82 years of epigenetic aging so then a next question that we can ask is how do these data compare with the epigenetic leaderboard so that is a real thing and for those who missed it i just took a little bit of a snapshot here and i'll put a link in the video's description description for people who may not have seen it so true diagnostic has ranked uh people based on their epigenetic age using the need and pace and it includes more than uh 1 750 people to date and there's supposedly an update i shouldn't say supposedly i've been told there's an update coming on march march 1st so i'm looking forward to that now just as a quick snapshot too of the leader the leaders on the leaderboard we can see that we've got rankings on the left and then the person's name so note that the rankings aren't sorted from one and down all the way to the 20 that were listed on the website and we'll see why in a second so then going forward we've got chronological age baseline dunedin pace value and then the percent improvement from baseline now note that the epigenetic or this epigenetic leaderboard was in intended as a list for dunedin pace improvement so you can see that the gray column highlighted the people on this list have the best improvement for their dunedin pace relative to baseline but a good thing about this or a great thing about this uh epigenetic leaderboard is that there's also the pace of aging over that with the average value over three tests and we can sort it uh based on that column two so when i sort it based on the average of three tests which i think is more relevant than looking at a percent improvement from baseline even though that's important don't get me wrong i'm just more interested in what is the closest to the truth story and we can get there by looking at the average of many tests rather than the improvement from one test so when i sort sort it by that uh standard we can see that jamari and richard who was seventh in terms of his improvement from baseline is actually first for his pace of aging average over three tests within uh the need and pace value of 0.696 so he's aging about 0.7 years for every one year of chronological age so remember that my data was 0.82 my average four test average was for donated pace was 0.82 which if it holds up on this epigenetic leaderboard based on you know knowing that they're going to update in a few days i may be in fifth place or somewhere around there based on the slowest dunedin pace remember so when the danita pace is smaller that's a slower epigenetic aging and if it's a higher number it's a faster epigenetic aging rate so again i'm very interested to see how the march 1st update comes and if i even make the rankings at all maybe there are people many people below me who have a faster average dunedin pace all right so now for the bad news which is my horvath data so so horvath's test or more specifically it's which is more specifically known as intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or iea is a marker of cell intrinsic aging so for this most recent test january of 2023 we can see that my horvath epigenetic age was 54.81 years which is five years older you can see the red arrow going in the wrong direction so how does this test compare with the previous three tests and we can see a similar trend for all of my horvath data for test number one six years older than my chronological age test number two four years older test number three my worst data seven years older to get a four test average for horvath of 54.9 years which is four to seven years older than micronological age so then the big question should be how can i reduce or that's epigenetic age and as we all know or many may know on this channel i track diet i also track supplements so with the next test i'll have five data points and then i can start looking for correlations to see what i can possibly do to improve my horvath's epigenetic age value but more specifically i've been taking 300 milligrams per day of nmn with the goal of increasing nad so what will that affect my horvath epigenetic age or even the other epigenetic age tests and we'll know uh in march as i'm going to send blood for analysis for epigenetic age on on march 6th and i'm also going to get a full blood panel to see how everything else looks on the same day all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch with links that'll be in the video's description including links for nad quantification discount links for green tea epigenetic testing is covered in this video oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatronic brand that link and all the other links for the discounts will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
