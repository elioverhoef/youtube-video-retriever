All right so let's start with albumin um and i'm going to go through every one of the nine variables uh on the list and i want to mention that obviously for the for the sake of time there's no possible way i can go through every study for each variable so for the point of brevity i i'm going to focus on the uh biggest studies that have uh uh enrolled the largest amounts of subjects these would have more uh statistical power to identify meaningful correlations and associations when compared with studies that may have a few hundred or or or a few thousand subjects for example here in the in this album in study this is a sample size that included more than one million subjects so okay uh the reference range for albumin is 35 to 50 grams per liter but what's optimal um so higher albumin levels are associated with biological youth and we can see that here so we're looking at abundant levels on the y-axis versus age and uh we can see the female plot and then we can see the male plot so males tend to have a higher abdomen up until about 60 or 65 um uh than females so what about risk of death uh for all causes actually before we go there so yeah and then going forward you can see that albumin very clearly decreases um with age for both sexes so what about all-cause mortality all-cause mortality risk so this is again a big study uh 1.7 million subjects and we're looking at female mortality ratios on on this side and then male mortality ratios on that side uh and then the x axis goes from higher albumin levels to lower abdomen levels so how we translate this is higher album in here so it would be greater than uh 45 i have it as i have it in milligrams for decimeter i didn't convert it back but it's the same so uh 4.5 milligrams per deciliter or 45 grams per liter in men and for women greater than 44 um would be associated with the lowest risk of death for all causes and then each of these different data points uh are for different age groups uh so men less than 50 men or women less than 50 50 to 69 years old and greater than 70. So what we can see is that as albumin levels decrease risk of death raw causes increases for both sexes so can albumin levels be optimized so uh i first started tracking all of my blood stuff 15 years ago and at that time it was only about once a year i didn't really understand the importance of uh testing more off more often back then so based on those approximately once a year measurements for for about 10 years in my 30s my average abdomen level was 4.74 milligrams per deciliter which translates into uh 47 uh it's it's just the unit difference but yeah it's 47 uh grams per deciliter so already i don't you know whatever i was doing at that time uh you know i was already off the chart uh you know higher levels being associated with biological youth when i should have been somewhere around here so whatever i was doing at that time it was definitely on the right track i should say i don't have longevity dna the longest person and long-sleeved man in my family is currently my dad who's 78 before that it was his dad was 67 so i don't have longevity dna i wouldn't attribute this to genetics so then in 2015 i started tracking more often i started dietary tracking and blood testing four to six times a year so i have 23 data points now for abdomen in the last five years and what we can see is that i've been able to increase my admin levels from the 4.74 to 4.93 and using using t-test these values are significantly different so now i'm even higher off the chart than it was before when i should be somewhere here and there should have been some age-related degrees so i've been able to resist the age-related decline in avenue one way i'm doing that is through diet and when looking at correlations between my diet with uh albumin the strongest correlation is for beta-carotene and so each data point corresponds to obviously albumin levels but then as i mentioned i tracked my diet so i can look for correlations between my diet with the biomarker in this case being the abdomen so the correlation for beta-carotene with abdomen uh is moderately strong about 0.6 remember a correlation of 1 or negative one cl as close to those extremes as possible is close to as linear as is a linear correlation but it it increases in strength as you get closer to one so uh granted it's not perfect but it's a moderately strong correlation so uh i shoot for about five which is biological youth and to get there if you just look go across you can see that uh based on the plot around 60 000 micrograms or 60 milligrams of beta-carotene should get me there now i don't supplement with beta-carotene um i for me primary sources of beta-carotene are carrots orange sweet potatoes red bell peppers spinach and parsley so i eat a ton of that stuff to get enough beta-carotene to potentially keep my albumin levels high
