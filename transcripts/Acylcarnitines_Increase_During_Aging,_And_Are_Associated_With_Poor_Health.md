Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and we can see that mitochondrial dysfunction is included as one of the 12 hallmarks with that in mind outside of a muscle biopsy can we evaluate mitochondrial function so in today's video we'll see that circulating levels of asil carnitines can be used as an index of mitochondrial function so first what are asil carnitines so the simple definition is that they are fatty acids bound to carnitine and we can see that represented here now there are many different asoc carnitine short chain medium chain dicarboxy etc just to illustrate one of them we'll go to the longchain ac asil carnitine group and i've circled the carnitine part of the aso carnitine and then that's bound in this case to palmitate the six c16 16 carbon fatty acid fa palmitate and then together that makes palmoil carnitine now i mentioned circulating levels of asoc carnitines can be used as an index of mitochondrial function so why is that within the mitochondria if there is a an a blockage to beta oxidation that leads to an accumulation of asoc carnitines but also fatty acids which together contribute to lipotoxicity in tissues such as the heart liver skeletal muscle and brain and then lipotoxicity that lipotoxicity as induced by asoc carnitines and fatty acids induces an alteration in mitochondrial morphology so alterations in size and shape bioenergetic dysfunction so it decreased ability to make atp induction of the permeability transition port the mitochondrial per permeability transition port so more stuff leaking in and out of mitochondria and it induces oxidative stress so with that in mind which asoc carnitines are related to health and aging and potentially more important more importantly can we track and optimize asoc carnitines so let's get into the data so first asoc carnitines are associated with an increased incident risk for having a major cardiovascular event and major adverse cardiovascular events or mace were defined as having a non-fatal stroke or mardial inunction so stroke or heart attack that didn't kill the person peripheral vascular surgical procedures and cardiovascular death and then in this study they used principal component analysis on 49 metabolites which group the metabolites statistically group the metabolites into seven principal component containing factors and then in a study of 85 year old 85y olds which metabolite containing factors were associated with having a major adverse cardiovascular event 3.5 years later and that's what we can see here so first we've got the hr hazard ratio next to that we've got the 95% confidence interval and remember that when the data in parenthesis is completely above one or below one we have a significant association and that's true for the two of the seven principal component or metabolite containing factors the first would be factor 7 which with a 2.18 uh hazard ratio so almost doubling of the the risk for having a major cardiovascular event if and that's in association with factor 7 which contained primarily the amino acid alanine ala but this is an asal carnitin focused video so you can guess what was also associated with having a major cardiovascular event and that was factor one which had there there was a 77% increased risk of having a major cardiovascular event for relatively higher levels of the metabolites that were found in factor 1 which were medium and longchain asoc carnitines c2 c6 c8 those fatty acids bound to carnitine now i should mention just to just a nitpick they the authors of this study define that group as medium and longchain asoc carnitines but c2 or acetal carnitine c6 hexo carnitine these are short chain fatty acids so technically that group description should be short medium and long chain asoc carnitines and one could even get more nitpicky and say that they they include unsaturated asoc carnitines too the 141 121 those are uns unsaturated fatty acid containing asoc carnitines all right so asoc carnitines are also higher in alzheimer's disease patients when compared with health healthy controls and that's we can see here so we've got eight different asoc carnitines and these data are in controls and alzheimer's disease patients ad and for each of these uh circulating asoc carnitines these are plasma levels of asoc carnitines we can see that each was significantly higher in the ad patients when compared with healthy controls now note that almost all of these asoc carnitines were also high associated with having a higher uh mace risk for having a higher risk of having a major cardiovascular event and that's without with the exception of the c18 asoc carnitine so the other seven in this study were also associated with having a higher risk of having a major cardiovascular vent and that's potentially important because replication across studies suggests that these specific asoc carnitines may be related to poor health so some of these asoc carnitines are also associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and that's what we can see in this paper the association between plasma metabolites and future risk of all cause mortality and i should mention that all the papers mentioned in the video will be in the video's description so if you're interested in uh checking out the paper for yourself it'll be in the video's description all right so then in this study they identified three asoc carnitines on the left c14 c16 and c18 the unsaturated versions of those fatty acids in association with all cause mortality risk now this study included two different studies so an internal replication the first included uh the mdccc study which had about 3,800 people an average age of 58 years and then a 22-year followup so starting with the initial assessment of metabolite levels how was that associated with all cause mortality risk 22 years later and then the findings for that study were replicated or attempted for replication in the mpp reexamination study which included a smaller sample size of about 1500 people they had an average age of seven years and 11year followup and then we put a red line at that hazard ratio of zero and we can see that for each of these three asoc carnitines they were significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk for both studies thereby highlighting or potentially highlighting their importance as markers of poor health especially when considering that they were associated with having a major adverse cardiovascular event too so how did these asoc carnitines the ones that were associated with having a cardiovascular event are higher in alzheimer's disease patients and all cause mortality how do they change during aging and that's potentially important because are these asoc carnitines markers of just a pathological state or do they also increase during aging which if that's the case then the age related changes are potentially related to the underlying path pathology that's related to uh having a major cardiovascular event and or alzheimer's disease so first in terms of age related changes let's take a look at one of the three that's above there the c181 uh carnitine and these are age related changes within the 45 to 85 year age range and for both studies the mdccc and the mpp reexamination we can see that there was a an increase for the c181 asoc carnitine in increase during aging all right so what about the uh other asoc carnitines how do they change during aging and that's what we see here we've got 14 asoc carnitines that were associated with having a cardiovascular event alzheimer's disease or all cause mortality on the left and then we've got data for people that had an average age of 97 years almost close to centenarian status you know so you got to be older than 100 to be a centenarian or defined as a centenarian their offspring plus spouses with an average age of 67 years and then when analyzing these data only one was not measured and that's the c181 which i just highlighted increases during aging from the 45 to 85 year age range unfortunately in this study it wasn't measured though and then of the 14 asoc carnitines on this list only one wasn't significantly higher in the older age group and that's the c18 to octa dinal carnitine that wasn't significantly different between the different age groups but then for the other 12 asoc carnitines we can see that each was significantly higher in the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds and that's because we can see that the p value and false discovery rate are both less than 0.05 so that's a potentially important finding because the having the the asoc carnitines that were associated with having a major cardiovascular event associated with alzheimer's disease or higher an alzheimer's disease and or all cause mortality those asoc carnitines also increase during aging so with that in mind can we track and potentially optimize levels of these asoc carnitines so asoc carnitines can be tracked using an atome metabolomic kit and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me talk about this kit in many videos so far i've used it to uh measure levels of torine and polyes which increase lifespan and rodents it includes curine and tryptophan as markers of the day noel nad synthesis pathway epa and dha the fish oil fatty acids which decline during aging and lower levels are associated with an increased alca mortality risk ces or cholesterol esters which are associated with epigenetic age it includes metabolites related to oxidative stress and now in this video asoc carnitines and it includes 38 asil carnitines so beyond just the the the metabolites that i've listed there that i have videos on the channel and i'll put some of those in the right corner this kit includes more than 600 metabolites so i've got more videos coming to go through almost all of them and if you're interested in using your using it yourself that link will be in the video's description or a discount link will be in the video's description all right so what's my data so putting up the 14 asoc carnitines which is what we can see on the left i have data so far for three tests and i'm waiting on results for test number four which then brings us to what's optimal well when considering that these asoc carnitines increase during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased risk for having a major cardiovascular event are higher an alzheimer's disease or are associated with increase all cause mortality risk i think it makes the most sense to try to avoid an age related increase for these asoc carnitines all asoc carnitines are not the same for how they change during aging or for their potential effects on health i'll also have that in upcoming videos so stay tuned so in terms of how i'm doing i'm taking the sum of these asoc carnitines and once i get to five tests i'm going to include them in my big picture biomarker list which includes the standard chem panel and then start to look at correlations with diet with the goal of keeping them towards the low end of my range so how am i doing so far with that and it's only three tests so far so i wouldn't take this data very seriously as i don't know if my dietary and supplement interventions or just normal test test to test variability is what's impacting these data but for the first test that was my best test so far based on keeping them relatively low at 15.2 micromolar as the sum but then for the next two tests they were a little bit higher 17 and 18.8 micromolar so again the goal is to keep these relatively low for the last do test they went in the wrong direction all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics ned quantification green tea epigenetic and tiir testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing which includes apo that's not included in the iolo kit so they're complimentary tests die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer
