By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In earlier videos we took a look at blood test data from jarahiman kamira a super centenarian who lived until he was 116 years old but note that jarahiman's data is just n of one what does centenarian blood test data look like in a relatively large cohort so in today's video we're going to take a take a look at blood test data from the hainan centenarian study which included 1754 subjects that had a median age of a hundred years as shown there and note that in terms of the gender distribution in this study 28 of the except more than 1700 people were men and 72 were women and this isn't an uncommon finding in centenarian studies as many studies have shown that women are far more likely to reach and status and beyond when compared with men all right so what about the blood test data so uh 16 blood test variables were uh published in the paper and in the interest of time in part one we're going to split this data up into two uh two parts so in part one we're going to go over the first half so eight biomarkers and especially all of these data that i'm going to present in the video are what's good and in the second half of this series i'm going to present data for the other eight biomarkers and we'll see what's good and what may be bad for the these centenarians for this more than 1700 uh people who had a median age of 100 years old all right so jumping right into it first let's start with fpg which stands for fasting plasma glucose and the data in the paper was presented in millimoles per liter so to convert that into milligrams per deciliter because not everyone's blood test data is presented in millimoles per liter some people have it in that other people like me have their data presented in milligrams per deciliter so we've got both values there so in this study how does glucose change with aging so that's what's presented here in this study of almost 12.5 million people so we can clearly see that blood glucose levels increase during aging for both men and green and women in red so what about the centenary and median data of 83 milligrams per deciliter well we can see that it's indicative of youth as it's at the far left side of the graph well what about all cause mortality risk so there's a j j shaped curve for all-cause mortality risk for its association with blood glucose levels and we can note that the centenarian data is within the lowest range for all cost mortality which is 80 to 94 milligrams per deciliter and note that as blood glucose levels increase during aging correspondingly we can see that all cause mortality risk increases for higher relatively higher levels of glucose so in terms of what's good uh to start we can see that these centenarians have relatively youthful and healthy levels of glucose so second up is total protein so how does total protein change during aging that's what's presented here and note that the units for this data is in grams per deciliter whereas in the centenarian study it was in grams per liter so to convert the units we would divide grams per liter by 10 to get 7.03 grams per deciliter so total protein declines during aging from values of about 7.4 in both men in green and women in blue towards values that are in the 6.6 to 6.8 range for men and women respectively so when plotting the centenary and median data for total protein of 7.03 grams per deciliter we can see that that would put them in the 60 to 70 year old range which is 30 to 40 years younger than expected based on their chronological age with a median age of 100 years now note that total protein includes albumin plus globulin and albumin data was presented in the paper as shown there so let's put that data into perspective so here we're looking at serum levels of albumin on the y-axis plotted against age and in this study of more than a million people the age range went up to a hundred years so we can clearly see that albumin levels decline during aging for both men and women with peak values in men of around 46 grams per liter and for women uh around 45 grams per liter so when putting the centenarian median albumin on this plot of 40.5 we can see that they've got a 20-year younger albumin levels when than expected based on their chronological age so they've got the albumin levels of about an 80-year-old so in terms of what's good from these data we can conclude that they've got relatively youthful levels of total protein and albumin what about the association for all-cause mortality risk with album and that's what's shown here so the hazard ratio for all caused mortality on the y-axis plotted against the albumin concentration on the x so first note that lowest all-cause mortality risk is when albumin is 46 grams per liter in this study of more than 425 000 people and i'll have all the papers referenced in this video in the video's description so putting the and median data on this plot we can see that their 40.5 is a little bit far from lowest all-cause mortality risk as there's a signific they have a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on their albumen data but note that for their chronological age of 100 years we'd expect to see albumin levels of 36. So when we put that data on the all-cause mortality plot the centenary and median value of 40.5 is 75 would impact in part a 75 lower all-cause mortality risk when compared with their age expected albumin level of 36 so from these data we can conclude that they not only have relatively youthful levels of albumin they also have a reduced significantly reduced age-expected all-cause mortality risk acm risk for albumin now note that we can rearrange the total protein equation to calculate the globulin concentration which equals total protein minus albumin and it's been referred to as the gamma gap so total protein minus ab albumin not only equals globulin but it's also referred to as the gamma gap uh so what how how can we put this globulin data of 29.8 grams per liter into perspective and it presented this data before in the jarahimon video so if you missed it he'll here be a good chance to catch up on that data so here we're looking at survival probability on the y-axis so baseline levels of the gamma gap or globulin levels were assessed at baseline and then survival was evaluated up to five years after the baseline visit and we can assess median survival by looking at the uh 50 percent uh survivor right there uh for both people who had a gamma gap less than 3.2 grams per deciliter which is indicated in blue and greater than 3.2 grams per deciliter which is indicated in red and again to convert the globulin data of 29.8 grams per liter to grams per deciliter we divide the grams per liter by 10 to get 2.98 now note that this study was in 94 year olds which is relatively close to the centenarian median age of 100 years old all right so when going back to the 50 survival when looking at people who had a relatively high gamma gap when compared with people who had a relatively lower gamma gap less than 3.2 in the blue line these two survival was significantly improved and people who had a lower gamma gap when compared with people who had a gamma gap that was greater than 3.2 and you can see that based on the log rank p value of less that p value less than 0.27 so from this by putting the centenary and median gamma gap or globulin data onto these curves they had a 2.98 grams per liter value which would put them on the blue curve which had a significantly improved survival when compared with relatively higher globulin levels so in terms of what's good we conclude from this data that they had relatively healthy levels of globulin all right so moving right along scr and that stands for serum levels of creatinine and uh creatinine is generally measured as a as an indicator of kidney function with one measure of kidney function being uh the egfr the estimated glomerular filtration rate so those values uh serum creatinine in this case was used to derive the egfr which we can see is 59.8 so close to 60. So let's put that data into perspective so here we're looking at the gfr estimate or egfr plotted against age and we can see that egfr declines during aging for both men in green and women in blue from values of about 125 in youth the two values for egfr approaching 50 in people older older than or about 95 years old so when putting the centenary and median gf egfr data onto this plot we can see that that would put them for someone who was about 65 years old which is 35 years younger when uh compared with their age expected egfr but note that creatinine may not be a good marker of kidney function in people older older than 65 and for that analysis i'll link to the video right there in the right corner so note that blood levels of uric acid and urea can further contribute to kidney function assessment so first let's have a look at the uric acid data that was presented in this in this video and that was indicated by sua or serum levels of uric acid so let's put that data for uric acid into perspective so here we're looking at the all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the uric acid concentration on the x and we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with a uric acid levels of 303 micromolar so what about the centenarian data how does that uh fit onto this plot well the centenary median uric acid level was 326 micromolar which is very close to the lowest risk for all-cause mortality based on this plot so from this we can conclude that they have close to optimal uric acid levels so in terms of what's good they had these centenarians of more than 700 1700 people have younger than expected kidney function and relatively healthy levels of uric acid all right so what about serum levels of urea so uh here's a plot for blood urea nitrogen which is the same measurement that was reported in the paper for serum urea and how it changes during aging and we can clearly see that a blood urea nitrogen bond increases during aging for both again men in green and women in blue so to put the centenarian data input into perspective with their blood urine nitrogen of 16 milligrams per deciliter that would put them in the 60 to 70 year old age range which is 30 to 40 years younger than what you would expect bond levels to be based on their chronological age so what about all-cause mortality risk and blood urea nitrogen levels and that's what's presented here so first note that lowest all-cause mortality risk at the bottom of that u curve is present when blood urine nitrogen levels are 5.26 millimolar or 14.7 milligrams per deciliter so the centenarian data is very close to that as you can see with their value of 16 milligrams per deciliter so they've got close to optimal bun so in terms of what's good these centenarians have younger than expected and relatively healthy levels of bun and note that collectively these three markers creatinine uric acid and urea suggest good kidney function in this centenarian cohort all right so two more biomarkers uh in this video uh triglycerides tgs let's put that data into into perspective so this is data for meta-analysis of 61 studies that included more than 700 000 people and we're looking at all-cause mortality risk plotted against the triglyceride concentration on the x-axis and what we can see first is that triglycerides as triglycerides increase all-cause mortality risk also increases as indicated by the red line and note that triglycerides of 90 or 1 millimolar is associated with the lowest risk for all-cause mortality all the way to the left now note that the centenarian data for median levels of triglycerides was 1.1 millimolar which is very close to the lowest risk on this plot of one millimolar so in terms of what's good these centenarians have relatively healthy levels of triglycerides and as i mentioned in the jarahimon video relatively low levels of triglycerides may be a hallmark of longevity so here's data for 11 centenarian studies you can see by the average age for the participants in these studies was at least 100 years old in each of these 11 studies and i'll put the link for all of these 11 studies which is on a link on my website that included all these 11 studies so if you're interested in that check out the video's description so note that in nine of these studies and note that this study that we're going over now in the video is not included on this on this list so this would be uh study number 12. In these 11 studies nine of these 11 studies triglycerides were lower than 101 milligrams per deciliter so now this is 10 of 12 centinarian studies where triglycerides are relatively low so less than about 101 milligrams per deciliter which suggests that the relatively low triglycerides may be a hallmark of longevity all right and then last but not least hdl so we can see their data here 1.4 millimolar 50 54 milligrams per deciliter let's put that data into perspective so first age-related changes for hdl we can see that hdl peaks and youth for both women and men for women about 64 for men with a peak of about 56 and then hdl declines during aging during aging pretty steadily for women as shown there by the red line and then for men the uh there's also a decline for about 10 years after which it's relatively stable but you can see it's at a lower level uh hdl's at a lower level almost exclusively for the duration of the lifespan when compared with women so the centenarian median hdl was 54 milligrams per deciliter so let's put that data into perspective on this graph so for women we can see that it would be for an hdl expected a value of about uh uh someone who is 74 years old so that's 26 years younger than expected based on chronological age and a hdl of 54 would be even younger for men we can see that it would put we would expect to see that value for a man that was 18 or 28 years old as indicated by the two black dots so from the from these data we can see that there's a 26 to 82 year younger hdl than expected based on a 100 year chronological age what about all-cause mortality risk and that's what's shown here so we can see that based on the centenary median hdl of 54 milligrams per deciliter that would put them right at the bottom of that all-cost mortality risk so lowest risk for all-cause mortality based on their hdl data so in terms of what's good these centenarians have relatively youthful and healthy levels of hdl all right that's the first eight biomarkers that were presented in this paper uh stay tuned for part two the other eight biomarkers uh which will be coming soon that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
