## Transcript

The best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age is the horvath clock and that's what we'll see here on the y-axis we've got dna and age otherwise known as dna methylation age or epigenetic age for the horvath test plotted against chronological age on the x-axis from birth up to about a hundred years old and note that this is a multi-cell and tissue clock and visually we can see that there is a linear correlation between horvath's epigenetic age with chronological age numerically we can see that that correlation is very strong with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and note that a correlation coefficient of 1.0 is perfectly linear so this is close to as good as it can get for the horvath correlation with chronological age but the horvath clock may not be the best for evaluating the epigenetic rate of aging and in contrast dunedin pace is potentially the best epigenetic clock for predicting the epigenetic rate of aging and i covered that in an earlier video if you missed it i'll put it in the right corner so with these two clocks in mind for epigenetic test number four in 2023 and note that this is july 5th data this is the most recent data that i have for these two tests i sent blood in august but i'm still waiting on those results what's my epigenetic age using the horvath clock and epigenetic pace of aging using dunedin pace so to answer that i sent blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own discount link in the video's description so let's start with the bad news which was dunedin pace and we can see that my dunedin pace for this test was 0.98 and what that means is for every one year of chronological aging one year of epigenetic aging now the best dunedin pace would be 0.6 so i've clearly got room for improvement based on this test but on the bright side 2023's average dunedin pace over four tests is not significantly different from 2022 data which is what we'll see here on the y-axis we've got dunedin pays values in 2022 on the left and for 2023 on the right over three tests in 2022 average studying and pace was 0.84 and thus far in 2023 it's 0.83 and that includes that most recent this most recent test of 0.98 now rather than looking at averages between years when using a two sample t-test to evaluate if they are statistically different or not we can see that the p-value is greater than 0.005 at 0.45 so 2023 data is not different from 2022 although i do have a few more tests left in 2023 to potentially make improvement now what could have caused this result if not if i'm not trying to learn from a quote unquote bad result i'm destined to repeat it again and more often so what could have caused this result now i also sent blood for nad analysis on july 5th the same day as this test and i sent that blood to jinfinity also there's a discount link for measuring your own nad levels so if you want to do that check out the video's description nad levels for the 7-5 test july 5th was 67.4 micromolar this is my highest nad level to date and that's in comparison with my baseline nad of 20 to 25 micromolar so how did i achieve that nad result well for those who are familiar with the channel i supplemented with 654 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid for nine consecutive days before this test which then raises the question is too much nice and bad for dunedin pace or more specifically is dunedin pace significantly correlated with niacin intake so i track diet every day as i use a food scale and also chronometer so we can take a look at the average daily niacin intake that corresponds or that's correlated with studying in pace over those seven tests so on the y-axis we've got the native pace plotted against the average daily niacin intake and note that if there are 60 days in between tests this is the 60 day average that corresponds to the latter test the test number two so for this plot we can see a significant positive correlation in other words a relatively higher niacin intake is significantly correlated with the need and pace and i should mention i looked for i looked at correlations for macros and micros so there were about 40 comparisons only two were nominally significant significant with a p-value less than 0.05 and niacin was one of them now as a criticism we can clearly see that there's one data point that's far away from the rest so whether this is an outlier whether it's a real effect whether this is a random variation in the dunedin pace test i don't know but these are what the correlations show so far it also raises the question is nad at 67 micromolar too high and potentially bad for dunedin pace i only have four blood test measurements for nad on the same day as epigenetic testing so i'm not going to run those correlations yet but i will keep an eye on that going forward and if there is a correlation between nad levels in dunedin pace it opens the idea and the question of what's optimal what's an optimal nad clearly above 20 to 25 micro molar it might not be 67 micro molar maybe it's 40 micromolar so using objective biomarkers outside of just nad to determine what may be optimal for nad levels now i mentioned there were two nutrients that were significantly correlated with donate and pace vitamin b6 was the other and that's we can see here average daily vitamin b6 intake their correlation its correlation with dunedin pace over those seven tests and we can see that significant positive correlation in other words the higher my daily vitamin b6 intake has been that's significantly correlated with an older dunedin pace but again we can see that that one data point to the far right is driving most of the correlation now i can more directly test the correlation by removing that from the stack which i have uh not for test number five but for test number six i can take it out and it was in the approach to try to reduce homocysteine and i'll have an update on whether or not that worked in an upcoming video all right moving forward what's my horvath epigenetic age as i mentioned earlier horvath's epigenetic test also known as intrinsic is the best for predicting chronological age for the july 5th test test number four in 2023 it was 52.49 years which is two years older than my chronological of 50.4 years and we can see i've got a red arrow there this is clearly going in the wrong direction so superficially this is also bad news but let's take a look at year-over-year changes for horvath's test and that's what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got intrinsic age otherwise known as the horvath test with data for 2022 on the left and 2023 on the right so over three tests in 2022 average horvath age was 55 years in 2023 over four tests it's 52.8 years and when using a two sample t-test we can see that it's just outside of statistically significant for 2023 versus 2022 with a p-value of 0.06 in other words there's a close to significant two-year reduction for horvath epigenetic age in 2023 versus 2022 so potentially some progress now it then raises the question which factors are significantly correlated with horvath's epigenetic age and if i know that i'm hopeful that i can reduce horvath's epigenetic age not just the 52 but maybe 50 48 and getting it even lower than my chronological age so the strongest correlation in my data is with body weight and that's what we'll see here with horvath's epigenetic age data plotted on the y-axis against my average daily body weight on the x and just like the dietary data note this is this is not my average body weight on the day of the test but my average body weight in between to in between tests so if there's 60 days in between tests that 60-day average body weight corresponds to the latter blood test and here we can see that significant positive correlation in other words as my body weight is higher that's significantly correlated with an older horvath epigenetic age and conversely a lower body weight is significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age which then opens up the question what will horvath's age look like as i'm able or as i reduce body weight further towards 144 and potentially even lower so we'll have to stay tuned for that in upcoming videos all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to buy aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any dequantification at home metabolomics or a microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with cyphox health which includes apob diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatron brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
