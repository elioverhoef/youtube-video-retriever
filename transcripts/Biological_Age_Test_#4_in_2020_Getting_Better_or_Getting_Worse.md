# Biological Age Test #4 in 2020: Getting Better or Getting Worse?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

What's up everybody so on tuesday i got my blood drawn again in order to measure biological age for the fourth time uh this year so before we get into that data let's just do a quick quick recap of my three previous tests so far in 2020 and then i'll provide a good segue uh into what my data was for the other day so my first measurement in 2020 was in february and we can see that my phenotypic age was about 14 years younger than my chronological age around 33 32.75 years now it's important to note that this data had a respiratory infection at that time so i expected it to be sub-optimal or not as young as it possibly could be so i didn't really change much i just recovered and retested again in march and we can see that just by recovering uh that reduced my biological age by about a year uh we can see that my white blood cells which were at 5.8 in february came down to 4.7 which is what you would expect with a recovery from respiratory infection also my lymphocytes went back up evidently respiratory infections reduced my percentage of lymphocytes so by recovering i was able to go back up a little bit but uh notice that i didn't do anything purposefully to lower my creatinine but whatever i did at that time lowered it from 1.08 milligrams per deciliter to 0.97 which is going in the right direction higher levels of creatinine are creatine increases with age and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so lower is better although i didn't do anything purposefully in the march blood test to improve that now i suffer from grasp and pollen allergies from late may to early august so i expected worse data in june when i tested last month and it's exactly what i got a phenotypic age of about 34 years so still 13 years younger than my chronological age and my worst uh reading uh to date uh for 2020. So glucose and creatinine have been going in the wrong direction for about a year and a half so uh in order to improve on the june blood test independent of you know the effect of my uh allergies on my uh biological age uh glucose and creatinine have been going in the wrong direction so i've been focused lately on trying to improve those so that i can reduce my biological age even if i've got allergy uh allergies negatively impacting my data so first what's impacting my glucose level so as everybody probably knows uh every time i blood test that blood test correlates with an average dietary period because i track my dietary data every day so if a given blood test is say three months uh two blood tests or three months apart i have three months of dietary data that would correspond to the next blood test so by doing that i can then start to look at correlations between my diet with that blood blood test results and with enough diet blood test result data i can investigate correlations so this is data for the last five years and what we can see is that my average daily fat intake is strongly correlated with my plasma plasma glucose level so this is the uh this is data 23 data points and we can see that the correlation coefficient is 0.72 which is technically strong and the p-value is statistically significant so higher fat intake daily fat intake higher levels of plasma glucose or at least that's the correlation so if i cut my fat intake will it affect the other phenotypic age variable so i investigated those correlations and there were non-significant correlations between my daily fat intake with rdw alkaline phosphatase and albumin however higher fat intake was also positively correlated with creatinine and white blood cell counts so higher fat daily fat intake higher creatinine and white blood cells which is going in the wrong direction lower levels of creatinine and white blood cells are found in youth and are associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk however uh uh actually going in the other direction a higher daily fat intake is negatively correlated with a uh lower lymphocyte a percentage of lymphocytes so that's actually going in the wrong direction because a higher level of lymphocyte percentage is found in youth and having more lymphocytes is is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk and similarly a higher my for me a higher daily fat intake is correlated with lower levels of crp so when considering cumulatively that my daily fat intake was uh correlated with three things going in the wrong direction but two things uh not going in the wrong direction i decided to cut my fat intake and see what that would do my total fat intake and see what that would do to my uh glucose creatinine and all the biomarkers so within my fat intake it the percentage of calories from saturated fat was significantly correlated with plasma glucose and that's important because daily fat intake can you know consists of monounsaturated polyunsaturated omega-3 omega-6 so of all the fats uh saturated fat was significantly correlated with plasma glucose so a higher saturated fat intake daily saturated fat intake higher plasma glucose at least that's the correlation so my primary sources of saturated fat are coconut butter and cocoa beans so i reduced my intake of these foods now i should also mention that i get about 11 grams of saturated fat from plain full fat yogurt every day but i didn't want to cut that because of a potential effect on my red blood cell counts and i'll get into that a little bit later so just to show how much that i uh that i cut of the cocoa beans and coconut butter we can see that my average what i've got listed here is my average dietary intake for the blood test previous to the one that i took a couple days ago and what we can see is that i cut my cacao my cocoa bean intake by about half 47 similarly i cut my coconut butter intake by about half i cut my uh total fat intake by which doesn't seem like much 12 grams and i cut my saturated fat by about eight grams 22 cut now based on cutting my uh total daily fat intake which was around 93 grams on my last measurement uh when you look at the trend line for the correlation between plasma glucose with my daily fat intake that correlates with a uh 92 grams a day of a daily fat intake correlates with about a 91 uh plasma glucose level so by cutting it my daily fat intake to around 80 uh grams per day um including the cuts from saturated fat i expected to see plasma glucose levels you know in the high 80s somewhere around 88 that's assuming causation i understand that that's you know why i do these experiments because with enough data but i'll have a hypothesis and test the hypothesis and if it doesn't work while the correlations will you know self-adjust based on how the data went and then i'll be able to find what really does cause things to change in my body based on diet or other other variables um so i expect to see glucose levels around in the high 80s and did i make any other diet did i make it sorry did i make any other dietary changes and i did so let's take a look at that so a higher diet dietary fiber intake per 100 100 calories otherwise known as dietary fiber density is significantly correlated with lower plasma glucose and that's what we can see here so glucose plotted on the y-axis against fiber density grams of fiber per 100 calories on the x-axis what we can see is that as the fiber density increases the plasma glucose level my plasma glucose level decreases and uh it's close to a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.62 and it's this is a statistically significant correlation so i also saw significant correlations for vitamin c uh potential renal acid low p rao and the potassium to sodium ratio with glucose so in other words higher levels of vitamin c were correlated with lower glucose a more negative potential renal acid load pural was correlated with lower glucose and a higher potassium k to na ratio was associated with lower glucose so when considering that broccoli uh positively positively affects each of these variables i added 300 grams of broccoli around 300 grams of broccoli per day so those who follow me uh probably know that i eat you know large quantities of vegetables so some might say how are you going to add 300 if you're already eating a lot of broccoli so this is my dietary intake of broccoli over the last two years uh broken down by uh average dietary period that corresponds to each blood test and while i was eating you know significant significant average daily amounts of broccoli every day up until about the last uh eight months or so i started to cut it down on purpose to try to see what effect that would have on my biomarkers so as you know just looking at the last blood test on june 23rd uh where i you know only took in an average of 19 grams broccoli per day on my for my latest blood test i averaged 295 grams of broccoli a day for the you know 30 ish uh a day period that preceded my blood test now so uh i've increased my broccoli intake relative to the to the last blood test and did that affect these other variables that were correlated with my glucose levels including vitamin c the potassium to sodium ratio and potential renal acid load peril so uh we can see that i increased my vitamin c intake about 150 milligrams per day uh my potassium the sodium ratio went up by one one unit and my p route went more negative so each of these changes because they were correlated with plasma levels of glucose i expected to see lower levels of glucose in addition to the changes in the fat intake so what was the impact now that i've shown you all the things that i did what was the impact on my blood test the other day well highly unexpected result my phenotypic age first of all uh 37.65 so even though it's nine and a third years younger than my chronological age this is my worst reading in seven tests i didn't expect this value at all going completely in the wrong direction so the impact of the dietary changes that i made on uh creatinine and glucose it didn't do anything creatine is still too high compared to where i'd like it to be and my glucose levels at 99 that's the second 99 i've gotten in my past uh actually in 2020 and that's definitely going in the wrong direction but also crp 1.01 milligrams per liter i mean this is two and a half fold elevated compared to my nine measurements of crp that i have since 2018 now one reason for that is definitely seasonal allergies you can see here i've highlighted or i've arrowed dates in june and july when i blood tested so with the exception of july 2019 we can see that my crp at you know 0.67 0.53 1.01 uh it's always significantly higher than any other time uh with the exception of that one blood test in 2019 but even if i take that july 2019 blood test into account my average value in june's and july from 2018 2019 2020 is still about double compared to non june and july measurements so definitely seasonal seasonal allergies are playing a role there but there are other factors that i'm not going to get into in this video or other factors that i think are contributing but i won't i'll save that for another video also my mcv and rdw are definitely going in the wrong direction uh the lower lower levels of both mcv and rdw are associated with biological youth and lower risk of all-cause mortality risk i have a video on that i'll link that in the right corner so that's the bad news the good news is even when i average my four biological age measurements over 2020 cumulatively that's 34 years which is still 13 years younger than my chronological age which isn't terrible um but i i want it to be as young as possible and also in in comparison my average phenotypic age in 2019 was 33.44 years so um even though 2020 uh you know i still have a couple more measurements to go in 2020 at worst if i am able to maintain a 34 biological age in 2020 that means over one year one year will have passed chronologically but i may have only aged around you know 0.5 to 0.6 years which that's pretty good um nonetheless i'm determined to improve on my data especially this blood test uh which again was completely unexpected so what will i try next to go to get it going in the right direction i'm only going to focus on a little bit uh you know i've already bombarded everybody with data in this uh video so i'll save uh some of the other data for another video but uh i didn't want to cut my yogurt intake but let's have a look at some data so i'm still interested in reducing my glucose and creatinine levels first so um i didn't eat yogurt up until around a year-ish ago and um so i didn't eat it at all wasn't in my diet uh for four years so this is data since 2015 and what we can see is that my glucose levels without yogurt listed versus with yogurt in the six measurements with it so when looking at the average value without yogurt i'm around 87 milligrams per deciliter for glucose but with yogurt my glucose levels are significantly higher around 95. So a similar trend is also going on for creatinine so and that's what i've plotted here and all of the data that i have blood test data that corresponds to dietary intake without yogurt and then in the six blood test blood tests that i have that i have eaten yogurt during those dietary periods that correspond to blood test data and what we can see here too is that without yogurt is my creatinine levels are significantly lower than when i have yogurt in my diet and again having lower glucose levels and having lower creatinine at least where i am now uh would be associated with a lower biological age and potentially lower risk of all-cause mortality and all the other good stuff that goes with that so um why haven't i cut jorgen then what what's going on there so um for some reason for whatever reason uh my red blood cells are strongly correlated with my average daily yoga intake so again this is data from 2015 to 2020 and this is uh 23 data points so 23 blood tests that correspond to 23 dietary intake so i've plotted red blood cells on the y-axis against yogurt intake on the x-axis and so first this correlation in the right side here again it's strong it's 0.90 and again a correlation of one or negative one as close as you can get to those values is as good as it gets and that's why it's a highly significant correlation here with the p-value that you can see so first without yoga in my diet you can see they're all lined up on the y-axis so my range without it was somewhere around 4.45 to 4.8 and that's 17 measurements where i couldn't get it higher than 14.8 no matter what my best efforts were and i tried a lot of different things over the four-year period to try to get it to go up but then what you can see too is that once i added yogurt in these six measurements since uh even with the yogurt intake somewhere in the uh 240 to 250 range and then higher amounts around 450 so so literally about a pound of plain full fat yogurt every day um my red blood cells were never less than five now um why is that important so red blood cell counts higher red blood cell counts are found in youth and they decline during aging and red blood cells carry oxygen so if you have less red blood cells you're going to have less hemoglobin less hemoglobin to carry oxygen your your cells may be self-optimal in in being able to get oxygen then and in that case you know you're you're going to make energy inefficiently because you don't have oxygen which is you know it's more efficient to to go through beta oxidation so um red blood cells in youth in men uh in the young men it's about 4.8 and then they declined to about 3.9 for nine-year-olds and older and for women uh red blood cells declined from about 4.3 to uh values around also 3.9 and 90 year olds older so that my you know that i could get without yogurt values as high as 4.8 was okay but for me i want to have red blood cells higher than five i've had red blood cell counts higher than five in the past from you know about 15 years ago um my my data for red blood cells so i wanted to get them back to where they where they should be so um what am i going to do so if i cut my yogurt intake from about 440 grams per day to 300 by extrapolating based on the trend line i should be able to if this correlation is causal we don't know that but uh if i cut it to 300 grams a day by extrapolating on the trend line i should be able to get a red blood cell count around five uh thereby enabling me to keep my red blood cells as close to biological youth as possible and if yogurt actually is involved in some cause whatever it may be if it's a saturated fat in yogurt that is indeed causing higher levels of glucose and creatinine for me um by reducing it by my intake by about a third that may also reduce my my glucose and creatinine levels which is what i want so lower glucose and creatinine while keeping my red blood cell counts high so again what about crp mcv and rdw everything that went in the wrong direction on my last blood test again i bombarded you guys enough with data for today that'll be uh another video and that's all i've got uh you can find me lots of places online have a great day
