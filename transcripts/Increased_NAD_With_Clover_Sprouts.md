# Increased NAD With Clover Sprouts

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Trigonelline as shown here is otherwise known as one methyl nicotinic acid in other words it's nicotinic acid a form of nasin with an attached methyl group trigonelline increases ned in mice and if you miss that video i'll put it in the right corner but what about in people so to address that let's take a look at which foods are trigonelline rich but first i want to give a thanks or say thanks and give a shout out to peter morell who pointed me to studies showing that clover seeds are one of the richest sources of trigonelline and that's what we can see here with trigonelline content on the y- ais per gram seed in various foods now for the last video in this series i tried increasing nad by adding alfalfa sprouts into my diet more specifically 132 gram per day for 8 days as alfalfa sprouts as we can see on the chart have about 10 micromolar teline per gram seed but if you missed that video it didn't move the needle in terms of a relatively big increase or any increase for nad so here we are still trying to increase uh nad through diet now if you notice there are two foods that are actually a lot higher than alfalfa for trig trigonelline content and that's coffee and i'm not opposed to doing a coffee experiment uh but just not yet and then also clover seeds more specifically crimson clover seeds or red clover seeds as shown here which have five times higher trigonelline versus alfalfa so with that in mind i added clover sprouts into the diet and took alfalfa sprouts out of the diet with an almost equal replacement 1205 gram of clover sprouts per day and note that i don't know if the sprouts have as much trigonelline as the seeds as there's no publish published data but i'm assuming that what's in the seed should be in the sprout so i did that experiment for 9 days so then can further increasing trigonelline or dietary trigonelline as there are no supplements currently that we can take to potentially increase nad can that impact blood intracellular levels of nad so for an april first test asent blood to g infinity for nad analysis and if you want to measure your own nad levels there's a discount link in the video's description so for this test ned was 29.6 micromolar and this is a potential ned increase albeit small but still in the right direction and a potential increase so how do we know that that's the case so for that let's take a look at all nad test results from january of 2023 through uh april of 2024 that's what we can see here so i have 17 tests over that period now without any precursors including nicotinic acid or nmn nad levels blood intracellular nad levels have never been higher than 26.6 micromolar and you can see that my range is 18 a2 to 26.6 micromolar and that's over these seven tests in contrast when i've had ned precursors in the approach ned has always been greater than 26 micromolar and that includes 1,000 mg of nmn with 39 micromolar for nad 61 micromolar nad for 2,000 milligrams of nmn with 12 mig of b6 and you may think that b6 may not be an ned precursor but it declines during aging and it's a required co-actor in the day noovo ned synthesis pathway which converts tryp thean into ned so i got a small increase there 30 micromolar and then nicotinic acid with or without tryptophan 59 and 67 micromolar and then lowd dose nicotinic acid so you can see the higher dose nicotinic acid was 600 mig per day i cut that 10x so even at uh 10 times lower nicotinic acid intake 60 mig per day increased nad to 38 micromolar and then 3 days before testing so no nicotinic acid for 2 days and then nicotinic acid on that third day prior to testing that's got a small bump outside of that 26.6 microl range without any precursors at 26.8 but there's one exception to this rule and that was at lowd dose nmn 300 milligram per day 25.3 micromolar didn't move the needle in terms of nad so i would need a lot more nmn to get a big boost for nad now for the most recent test we can see that 29.6 micromolar is outside side of my uh range without any precursors with the highest level being 26.6 micromolar that's why i suggest that uh or that's why this data suggests that i did get a small but potential uh increase for nad with the addition of clover sprouts into the diet so to add some context for 9 days before testing before the april 1 test my average daily intake of trigonelline not just from clover sprouts but from all other sources as there are a few other sources but the do predominant amount of trigonelline came from clover sprouts as you can see 110 of the 138 milligram per day average came from clover sprouts now to put that into perspective we can take a look at the march 4th test where i averaged 51 migs of trigonelline per day half of that came from alala sprouts if you missed that video i'll put the nad playlist that contains it in the right corner so that was one week before testing now there is a potential confounder in these data and that's lowd dose nicotinic acid which i haven't stopped taking completely during these two periods and that's because i may see some benefit from lowd dose nicotinic acid and helping with exercise uh recovery in terms of the effect on heart rate variability and resting heart rate so for the march test i supplemented with an average of 45 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day but that didn't move the needle as you can see uh nad was 26.3 micromolar which suggests that in my case at least 60 mig of nicotinic acid per day on its own without alfalfa or clover sprouts may be uh uh necessary to move the needle in terms of increasing nad so how much nicotinic acid did i supplement with prior to the april test so only 20 milligrams per day on average and no nicotinic acid for 4 days before testing and we know that 3 days before testing i barely got a bump to 26.8 with nicenic acid nonetheless 20 mig is a very low dose relative to where it was for the march test so that suggests that this was a clover sprout induced small bump about 10% increase for n which isn't very much i'm hoping for a much larger gain so with that in mind if i increase clover sprouts if i double their intake to 250 gams per day will that further increase ned if it doesn't and it stays about where it was then this is just probably test the test variability uh and not impacted by clover sprouts and their trigonelline content at all but then additionally i'm not is interested in nad as a part of this experiment what's the effect on other biomarkers so i don't yet know uh if clover sprouts will make a dent on other biomarkers will the net effect be positive will i get an increase in nad and other biomarkers go in the wrong direction i don't yet know that so that test is scheduled for april 29th coming up in about a week and in in addition on that day i'll send blood for metabolomics where i can quantify plasma levels of trigonelline so we can compare against other periods where i didn't have a relatively high dietary intake to see how that affects plasma levels and i'll also take a look at epigenetics as trigonelline can act as a potential meth methyl donor so maybe that'll impact horvath and d and pace so stay tuned for that data coming sometime in may and early june all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for any quantification epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sci fox health which includes apob and also grim age green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
