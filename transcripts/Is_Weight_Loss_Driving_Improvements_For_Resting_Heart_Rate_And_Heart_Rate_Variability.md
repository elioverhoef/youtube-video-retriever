# Is Weight Loss Driving Improvements For Resting Heart Rate And Heart Rate Variability?

## Transcript

In my last video i talked about optimal ranges for resting heart rate and heart rate variability and presented some of my own data and progress for the past two years for those variables but i didn't talk much about how i've been able to make progress over the past two years now consistent exercise training would be expected to improve resting heart rate and heart rate variability but what about other factors so i've left up my uh resting heart rate data from the last video just for reference and i added a little bit more data i included my july data whereas before i did not include that data so why is that data there well uh it's possible that weight loss may be driving my improvements for resting heart rate variability why would i think that so here's a plot of my average monthly body weight for the same uh period so from august 2018 through july 2020 so body weight on the y-axis plotted against time and there's it the plots look almost identical so we can see that i've reduced my body weight then it went back up then it went back down consistently and that trend is almost perfectly represented in my resting heart rate data with the exception of uh you know my last few months of resting heart rate data with a small uptick in the resting heart rate so from this it would seem that body weight may be driving the improvements that i see i've seen in resting heart rate and heart rate variability over the past two years so let's look at some correlations let's investigate a little further so first let's look at a correlation between a resting heart rate against body weight so this is now individual data so each day for the past uh you know two plus two years since august 2018 through july of 2020 with wrestling heart rate plotted on the y-axis against body weight and what we can see by the black trend line is that there's a decent correlation on the border of of moderate with a correlation coefficient of 0.4 between my body weight with resting heart rate so um the percentage of the variance that's explained uh by body weight uh the percentage of the variance in resting heart that's explained by body weight is uh 16 which isn't much but it's it's it's a decent amount and then this correlation between body weight uh with resting heart rate is highly significant statistically significant with a p-value of 8.4 times 10 to the negative 29. So what about heart rate variability's correlation with body weight so we see that here heart rate variability plotted on the y-axis against body weight and the higher my body weight the worse my heart rate variability conver conversely uh the lower my body weight the higher my heart rate variability and uh we can see that by the red trend line now again this is a you know a weak correlation but it's highly significant uh statistically significant uh so just to go over that real quick the correlation coefficient between body weight with my heart rate variability is 0.25 six six percent of the variability in in hrv is explained by body weight and then the p-value highly significant 8.8 times 10 to the negative 12. So it looks like body weight may be driving a decent amount of my progress in wrestling heart rate and heart rate variability now one component of body weight maintenance is calorie intake now i haven't done more exercise over the past two years i've been consistent you know three to four times a week with my strength training and flexibility training and you know 15 to 20 miles of walking or biking so i haven't increased my uh amount of exercise um but i have purposely cut my calorie intake during that time with the goal of getting uh leaner or as lean as i possibly can thereby resulting in in this uh eight pound weight loss over the last two years so is calorie intake is my daily calorie intake correlated with rest heart rate heart rate heart rate variability let's have a look at that data so um first we're looking at a plot of wrestling heart rate on the y-axis against my daily calorie intake and for those who don't know i track my calorie intake every day i weigh all my food and then i log the amounts of food into an online app that tells me my macros and micros i then log that data into an excel file so i have all that data and i forgot to mention about my body weight i weigh myself at the same time in the morning after using the toilet every every day so i log all of the all of these data all right so back to the plot so resting heart rate versus daily calorie intake and we can see actually a moderate strength correlation here so the higher my calorie intake black trend line the worse or higher my resting heart rate so that correlation is 0.54 29 of the variability in resting heart rate can be explained by by daily calorie intake and this uh correlation is the most significant of all the correlations that i've shown so far with a p-value of 1.6 times 10 to the negative 55. So what about heart rate variability and its correlation with daily calorie intake so a weaker correlation but still significant nonetheless um and again you can see that the higher my daily calorie intake the lower of my heart rate variability conversely the lower my daily calorie intake the higher my heart rate variability so uh the correlation here is 0.14 2 of the variability in hrv can be explained by my daily calorie intake and that p value for this correlation is significant 8.8 times 10 to the negative five so if you're looking to improve your resting heart rate and heart rate variability obviously you want to have a consistent exercise program but also uh monitoring your calories reducing them by a small amount for a long period of time thereby resulting in weight loss to improve body composition may help or at least based on my data it may help so that's all i've got for more info you can find me lots of places online have a great day
