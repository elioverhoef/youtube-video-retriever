# CD38 gets in the way of NR and NMN for increasing NAD+

Nad levels decrease during aging and a major reason for that is because of cd38 which directly degrades nad well can we bypass cd 38's effects on nad by supplementing with nicotinamide riboside nr or nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn so while we think that well nr is converted to nmn which is converted into nad so by supplementing with nr or nmn one would expect higher levels of nad well maybe not so why maybe not because cd 38 degrades and are so mice that were ejected into the abdominal cavity so ip injection uh and then nr levels were uh uh followed over time uh in this case shown in the y on the x-axis you know 30 minutes after injection 75 minutes and 150 minutes after injection with nr and what we can see is that in the wild type animals which have cd38 nr levels rapidly decline in contrast cb38 knockout animals mice that do not have cd38 anywhere in their body we can see that nr uh levels are stable over time so that suggests or strongly suggests that cd38 degrades nr well in that situation it isn't just nr that's getting degraded the nmn and nad are also uh lower in animals that have cd38 so um what about nmn what if we just give nmn uh supplement supplementation to uh to mice what happens so it's a similar story to the nr uh in our story where we can see that uh the wild type animals have a rapid decline in nmn levels in uh in contrast to the cd-38 knockout animals which have higher levels of nmn when compared with the wild type so cd38 degrades nmn so for maximal efficiency of nr and nmn supplementation on nad levels having low levels of cd38 is going to be important now if everything i just showed was a major part of the story why is it that when considering that cd38 degrades an r why wasn't nad reduced or why wasn't there no change at worst no change for nad levels in this nr supplementation study and i've shown the important data from that study here where a thousand milligrams a day of nr increased nad levels however in two other studies nr supplementation did not increase nad so first and left they supplemented uh subjects with 2000 milligrams a day of nr but nad levels were not different when compared with uh placebo similarly in the uh image to the right adding a thousand milligrams or supplementing with a thousand milligrams a day of nr didn't change nad levels either so what's different between these three studies why would it work in one situation but not in two others so the bmi in the first study was 24 which is considered uh normal weight uh normal weight is considered a bmi of less than 25. In contrast in the study to left the bmi was 30 which is defined as obese and similarly also obese in the other study 33 so for whatever reason nr supplementation did not work in the ob subjects uh when compared with the normal weight or lean subjects so what does obesity have to do with the nad story so first what we're looking at is serum endotoxin activity uh sorted by bmi so the white bars are in normal weight with an average bmi of 23 kilograms per meter squared and the the gray bars the shaded bars the subjects had a bmi of 30 which is defined as obese and what we can see is that the obese subjects had significantly higher levels of endotoxins so what is endotoxin why is that important what does that have to do with this cd38 and nad story so first endotoxin which is also known as lipopolysaccharide or lps is found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and just to illustrate what that means and where it is so uh this is the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria and then this is the outer membrane and you can see that the shapes the blue shapes are like a polysaccharide a metabolite that's anchored to the outer membrane of bacteria so what does lps have to do with the cd 38 story well in macrophages that are exposed to lps uh after 24 hours we can see a five-fold increase in this is cd38 gene expression so gene expression in macrophages is five-fold increase uh following exposure to lps for 24 hours and after 48 hours that the macrophages are exposed to lps it's the cd38 gene expression is seven-fold increase now i didn't show it here but also uh cd38 gene expression doesn't just increase but cd 38 is then released from the macrophages in response to lps so then higher higher systemic levels of cd38 can go and inhibit nad metabolism anywhere which is a bad thing so with all these data i just showed you with obesity there's increased circulating lps and then potentially when considering the link between lps and cd38 gene expression increased cd38 would that explain why there was no effect of nr supplementation on nad levels in the two studies that had obese subjects so what does this have to do with aging uh we all care about aging i care about aging so what does it have to do with aging well lps increases during aging uh first in mice we're looking at plasma endotoxin levels which is again lps in young mice ym versus adult mice and the young mice are four months so maximum lifespan of mice is 40 months so this is 1 12 of the lifespan so this is like uh data in 12 year olds and the adult mice were 18 months of age again 18 divided by 40 is is uh in equivalent terms for a human 120 year lifespan is about a 54-year-old subject so we're comparing 12-year-olds with 54 you know around middle-aged and we can see around a two-fold increase in the middle-aged uh mice when compared with uh young some similarly lps increases during aging in people so we're looking at plasma endo toxin levels in young 26 year olds versus older adults 74 year olds and again about a two-fold increase in old versus young so when considering these data age-related increase for lps potentially increase cd38 expression would we then have a decreased efficacy for nr and nmn supplementation on nad levels so when considering the effects of lps on cd38 which interventions reduce lps and uh i'm just going to show data for cr calorie restriction here because that's the gold standard for lifespan extension uh animals mice that are uh calorie restricted don't have a maximum of 40 months they live 50 months so you know a 25 lifespan increase or around or around that so uh one mechanism for that lifespan extension may involve that uh calorie restricted mycr have lower levels of serum endotoxin as shown here so when compared with the ad-lib mice meaning they eat as much as they want animals they ate or mice that ate 40 percent fewer calories had about half the serum endotoxin levels so with this in mind cr decreases lps potentially having low cd38 levels would that lead to maximize nad levels in calorie-restricted mice in humans so i couldn't find any randomized controlled trials using calorie restriction and then measurement of nad but in in uh you know yeast and worms and other model organisms calorie restricted as calorie restriction is well documented to increase nad so i'd posit that one mechanism for that may involve calorie restrictions ability to reduce systemic levels of lps now when considering that the lpsc 38 story another interesting hypothesis is that calorie restriction plus nr or nmn would we get further increased nad and or maximized nad as high as the system could get for that so that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
