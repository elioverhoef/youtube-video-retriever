# Biohacking The Oral Microbiome: Test #2

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In part one of optimizing the oral microbiome we saw that i was using a homemade mouthwash as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome so what does that mouthwash include well it includes 11 grams each of xylitol and sodium bicarbonate three drops of peppermint oil 4 grams of potassium nitrate and all of that together as a prebiotic mixture in one liter of water so why are each of these components there well xylitol has been shown to inhibit the growth of a bacterium that's related to cavity formation streptococcus mutants or s mutants sodium bicarbonate is there because it alkalinizes the mouth and note that cavities form at an acidic ph so having bicarbonate there would be expected to remove acid from the mouth peppermint oil has been shown to limit growth of p gingivalis and then potassium nitrate which was the newest addition i've used this mouthwash for a while but prior to this test i included potassium nitrate this was a new addition i expected that it would increase nitrate reducing bacteria in the mouth which may also limit growth of bacteria that have been linked with poor oral and systemic health so we can see that visually here so an increase in oral nitrate has been shown to increase health-associated oral bacteria including nessaria and rothia while decreasing levels of bacteria in the mouth that are related to bad breath or halitosis period periodontal disease and carries or cavity formation so that's what i expected to see now in part two in today's video we'll see was my salivary microbiome composition improved relative to test number one and there are three questions involved in that question first were levels of nitrate reducing bacteria increase second beyond levels of nitrate reducing bacteria were levels of other oral health related bacteria improved and third beyond the mouth were levels of oral bacteria that have been linked with adverse systemic health reduced and to answer these questions i sent another saliva sample to bristle and if you're interested in quantifying your own oral microbiome or salivary microbiome you can use my discount link conquer age of conquer aging 15 and that link will be in the video's description all right so for test number two the first question up is word levels of nitrate reducing bacteria increased and that's what we can see here we've got seven bacterial species that have been shown to have nitrate reducing ability so for the first test we can see that the relative abundance the sum of all of these bacteria in my saliva sample was 53 so in other words 53.1 percent so in other words of all of my bacteria just these seven species were 53 so based on having nitrate in the mouthwash i expected to see an increase in these nitrate reducing bacteria but that's not the case in fact it looks like well not it looks like it went down to 46 percent so now these aren't the only species that are related to nitrate reduction and in fact there are up to 30 or more bacteria and you can see the paper link that i've got there rossier uh 2020 and that link is in the video's description too if you're interested in checking out which bacteria besides the one on this short list so when i sum all of the 30 bacteria that have been shown to have nitrate reducing ability that comes to 78 for test number one and then about 69 for test number two so in other words no matter how you cut it nitrate levels nitrate reducing bacteria were not increased despite having four grams per liter of potassium nitrate in the mouthwash so then the question is why so i'm already on a high nitrate diet which may have saturated oral nitrate levels which would be then expected to limit any further growth of nitrate reducing bacteria in my saliva so that's uh so we can see that here by looking at the foods that i commonly consume that have nitrate and you can see the nitrate content there is milligrams of nitrate per 100 grams of each of these foods and because i track my diet every day i know my average intake for at least the one week period before test number two so we can see my average daily intake for each of those foods there and then we can calculate my average daily nitrate from each of these foods by multiplying the nitrate content by my average intake for each of these foods as shown in the right column so then when taking the sum of nitrate for all of these foods that comes out to about 1700 milligrams of nitrate dietary nitrate per day so is how do i know that's high or low or or its status well an acceptable daily intake for nitrate has been reported as 3.7 milligrams of nitrate per kilograms of body weight per day so my current body weight is 69.1 kilograms or 152 pounds and we're multiplying 69.1 kilograms by 3.7 milligrams of nitrate per kilogram body weight we get an acceptable daily intake for nitrate of 256 milligrams per day so my current intake of 1700 milligrams per day is six to seven times higher so that's why we can see i'm already on a high nitrate diet which may have saturated oral nitrate levels so should i remove kno3 or potassium nitrate from the mouthwash so before making that uh decision let's take a look at the rest of my oral oral microbiome composition so outside of nitrate reducing bacteria were levels of other salivary bacteria affected and for that we're going to take a look at bristles definition of beneficial bacteria we can see that one of them does include nysaria nasseria mucosa the second bacterium on the list but the rest are not related to this area or rothia so for the first test i had 21.4 percent of quote-unquote beneficial bacteria bacteria that have been linked with oral health but for the second test i had a similar amount 21.1 percent so to answer the question were levels of oral health bacteria related oral health related bacteria increased the answer is no so from this we can see that having potassium nitrate in this prebiotic mouthwash didn't only uh it didn't increase nitrate reducing bacteria but it also didn't increase levels of other oral health related bacteria so what about levels of bacteria that have been shown to be associated with poor oral health were they reduced as a result of having nitrate in the mouthwash so here we're going to start off with bacteria that have been linked with gum inflammation so for test number one i had 3.8 percent of all of my bacteria were related to gum gum inflammation and for test number two there was some improvement so reduction to 1.8 percent now if i'm going to make further improvements where would that be so we can see that the majority of that 1.8 percent comes from two bacterium so fusobacterium nucleatum is shown with the red arrow and then also another red air with tantarella forsythia so when you sum those two that's one point five percent so if i can reduce those i should be able to reduce that 1.8 percent of of bacteria that are related to gum inflammation to maybe even lower somewhere around point three percent all right so what about levels of bad breath related bacteria were they reduced as a result of the prebiotic mouthwash so we can see here bacteria related to halitosis so for the first test i had 5.5 of all bacteria that were related to or that have been shown to be related to halitosis and for test number two essentially the same or at best a minor reduction 5.2 percent so once again if i'm going to make improvements we can see those two bacteria pop up again fusobacteria nucleatum and tannerelophores cyphia so 1.5 percent of that 5.2 if i can somehow reduce those bacteria would make a bigger dent in bad bad breath related bacteria all right what about levels of tooth decay related bacteria were they reduced so for that we go to a different picture and we can see uh we're looking at dental caries or cavities and bacteria that have been shown to be related to cavity formation and for both tests for the first test i had zero percent which is good news for the second test i had a small but still approximately zero uh increase for one of these bacteria nonetheless we can see i have zero percent of all of my bacteria related to cavity formation or carries so what about levels of bacteria that have been linked with other poor oral health related conditions were they reduced one of those conditions is primary endodontic infection which is infection of the dental root inside the tooth and we can see that for both tests i had a lot of those bacteria so without going through each one by taking the sum for the first test 2.9 percent for the second test there was some improvement 1.7 percent now if i'm going to make further improvements just like the for the for some of the other conditions we saw those two bacteria and once again we can see those two bacteria again fusobacteria nucleatum and tannerella forsythia 1.5 percent of the 1.7 so if i can reduce those two levels of those two bacterium it would make a big dent or it should make a big dent for overall reducing that 1.7 to 1.5 all right also periodontal disease for test number one i had 0.7 test number two it actually went in the wrong direction 1.2 percent and but once again we can see that tannerella forsythia popping up 0.8 of the 1.2 percent comes from that bacterium alone so for a summary for the bacteria that have been linked with conditions in the mouth we can see i had decreased levels of nitrate reducing bacteria so i put that in red going in the wrong direction and then for green going in the right direction levels of bacteria related to gum inflammation so decreased and levels of bacteria related to primary endodontic infection unchanged were levels of beneficial bacteria and i put that in black because it's it's really not known what the optimal percentage should be is it 21 should be 24 or higher who knows nonetheless i put halitosis in red because who wants to have relatively high levels of bad breath related bacteria in their mouth i don't and unchanged were dental care is at zero before and a zero again which is good news and then increased in red going in the wrong direction are bacteria related to periodontal disease so if we if we take the net picture we can see i've got three green three red and one that didn't change essentially a neutral effect of my prebiotic mouthwash on conditions related to inside the mouth so what about levels of salivary bacteria that have been linked with adverse health conditions outside the mouth were they reduced as a result of having nitrate in the mouthwash so first let's take a look at bacteria related to atherosclerotic plaque oral salivary bacteria for the first test i had 2.3 percent and then there was a reduction 2.9 percent so once again though if i'm going to further reduce that 0.9 percent we can see that tantarella forsythia again pops up 0.8 of the 0.9 just comes from that one bacterium bacteria oral bacteria that have been linked with pneumonia i had 0.3 percent for the first test 0.8 uh eight percent for the second so that's going in the wrong direction uh so i've got to keep an eye on that oral bacteria salivary bacteria that have been linked with rheumatoid arthritis so i had 0.8 for the first test point a for the second test so no no change there but again note that if i'm going to make improvements to reduce that 0.8 tannerel forsythia once again all of that point eight percent for the second test comes exclusively from that one bacterium and then sjogren's syndrome i've got a bunch of bacteria related to that but still relatively low levels 0.2 percent test number one to point two on test number two and then uh lupus so that's an autoimmune disease i've got a bunch of bacteria that are related to that unfortunately and it actually went up from point seven percent on the first test to 2.3 percent on the second test and i don't have a strategy to go after that yet uh i think the better strategy is to go after those two bacterium that have been popping up in all these adverse health both inside the mouth and outside the mouth related conditions so in taking the sum from each of these bacteria that have been linked with adverse health related conditions outside the mouth that sum is 4.3 for test number one and there was some improvement at 3.4 percent uh for test number two so but note that these these aren't a major changes these are very small changes for each respective condition so i think it's fair to say that it looks like having four grams of nitrate four grams per liter of nitrate uh in my prebiotic mouthwash didn't have a major impact on salivary bacterial composition so to answer that question should i remove it from the mouthwash i'm going to cut it in half and that would be the first step before actually removing it uh cut it in half see how the how the overall microbiome composition looks for my saliva for the next test so then the big question uh becomes how can how else can i improve my salivary microbiome and as as noted you know i've been indicating these two bacterium that have been popping up everywhere so what reduces levels of these two bacterium so first uh beta karyophylline which is found in clove oil has been shown to reduce tannerella forsythia growth so on the y-axis we're looking at growth of tannerella forsythia against the concentration of beta-cario filene which again is found in clove oil so when compared with controls we can see that a relatively low amount of beta karyophiline leads to an 80 reduction in tannerella forsythia growth so that's good news now beta karyophylene and clove oil each have been shown to also reduce levels of that other bacterium that popped up in a whole bunch of different places fusobacterium nucleatums growth and we can see that here so first we're looking at the mic and the mbc so what is that so first the mic is the minimum inhibitory concentration that's the minimum amount of either beta karyophylline or clove oil that inhibits growth of this bacterium and the mbc is the minimum bactericidal concentration so how little of each of these two components beta karyophylline and clove oil do you need to completely kill off this bacterium so we can see that beta carriophylline first has some ability to both inhibit growth and to kill levels of fusobacterium nucleatum but note that when you look at the data for clove oil 0.1 and 0.2 far lower amounts of clove oil can both inhibit and kill off fusobacterium nucleatum so from when considering both of these data for these two different bacteria and components of clove oil or clove oil itself may impact that for the next test i'm going to include that in my prebiotic mixture but note that these are in vitro studies there's no data or rcts looking at this in vivo so whether it will work or not that's unknown but i can do that experiment by again testing my salivary microbiome with bristle so for the next test besides reducing my potassium nitrate levels in the prebiotic mixture to 2 grams per liter so cutting it in half i'm going to add three drops of clove oil an equivalent amount the the same amount that i've got for peppermint oil and again even how much of an amount very debatable but all i can do is test and evaluate the data for my salivary microbiome once i get it to see if it made an effect or not so stay tuned for test number three to see how the story goes all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon now before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links uh
