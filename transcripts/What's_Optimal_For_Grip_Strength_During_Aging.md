# What's Optimal For Grip Strength During Aging?

## Transcript

Grip strength declines during aging and that's what we'll see here with data for men on the left and for women on the right on the yaxis we've got average levels of grip strength plotted against age on the x and then starting with the data from men we can see that grip strength peaks around 35 to 40 years at around 50 kg for men in women grip strength peaks a little bit later 40 to 45 years and that's around 33 kg but then we can see for both men and women grip strength declines during aging now in terms of defining what's optimal for a given biomarker how it changes during aging is one part of the story the other part is all cause mortality risk so what's optimal for grip strength in terms of all cause mortality risk and that's we'll see here with the hazard ratio for all cause mortality or risk of death for all causes plotted on the y-axis plotted against grip strength in kilogram on the a this is a meta analysis of 42 studies that included more than 3 million people so in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one remember when the confidence interval the 95% conf confidence interval those are the dash black lines are completely below one or completely above one we have a significant association so we can see that that's true for all levels of grip strength as grip strength increases such that the 95% confidence interval is completely below that hazard ratio of one for all values of grip strength greater than around 9 kg now in terms of the maximal effect that's greater than 54 kgrs and from this plot we can see that a relatively higher grip strength is significantly associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk more specifically the highest grip strength was significantly associated with a 65% reduced risk of death for all causes now in terms of what's optimal now we can answer that question so greater than 50 kg for men and at least greater than 33 kg for women and then avoiding the age related decline now the good news is that grip strength can be tracked and potentially optimized and the gold standard for clinically measuring grip strength is shown here this is the jamar dynamometer or the g jamar grip strength meter but this is a $300 device or more so are there are other grip strength meters as effective or and more affordable so one option is the can memory eh11 dynamometer as shown there and the the importance of that grip strength meter is that it's strongly correlated with the jamar dynamometer or the gold standard grip strength meter and that's what we'll see here so on the y- axis we've got the best camry measurement and on the x we've got the best jamar measurement and then we can see that there's a significant positive correlation between these two grip grip strength meters with a correlation coefficient in that green rectangle of 0.94 note that a perfectly linear correlation is 1.0 so 0.94 is pretty close as good as it can get but note that these data are in 42y olds what about at older ages so to date as far as i know there's at least one study that's looked at that as shown here with an average age of 66 years old in the study where they combin the jamar and the camry grip strength meters and then we can see the correlation at the far right so when looking at the average or max value for the dominant hand we can see that the correlation between these two grip strength meters was strong so anything defined at as greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation so the correlation when looking at the dominant hand for average or maximal values was 0.821 and 0.81 so strong correlations but the best way to use the camry if one's going to get that uh instead of the gold standard jamar is to take the average value or the maximum value for six times as shown there and the correlation was a bit stronger at 0 uh 855 and 0.852 so if you're looking to get the biggest bank for the buck testing six times is the way to go so from both of these studies we can see that the camry grip strength meter is significantly correlated with the gold standard grip strength meter in both young and older adults so at this point in the video i would then ask what's my data and then show my data as i'd been tracking it for for many months so i should say that i do have the camry and i haven't started tracking it yet that's going to start next week so stay tuned for a future update video where we'll see what's my data in terms of grip strength and how well i'm able to resist age related changes or not in the next few months all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sidef fox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chron meter or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
