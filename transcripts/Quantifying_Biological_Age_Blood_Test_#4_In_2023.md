## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the fourth time in 2023 and with that in mind what's my biological age so we can see that data here this is using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and if you have blood test data and you want to calculate your own biological age using levine's test the pheno wage link will be in the video's description so when entering these data including albumin creatinine glucose etc i get a biological age of 34.5 years which is about 16 years younger than my chronological now note that for the 11th consecutive test quests high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 milligrams per liter further reducing my biological age but that's the limit of their detection it's not higher than 0.3 milligrams per liter and rather than looking at data on a spreadsheet all blood test data screenshots of the lab report are included later in the video now note that this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 as i now have 26 blood tests over that time period and that's we can see here so from 2018 to 2019 i tested three times with an average biological age of 36.1 years then over 2020 to 2021 i tested 12 times with an average of 35.6 in both 2020 and 2021 over seven tests in 2022 i significantly reduced that to 33.8 years and if you missed those videos there some of them will be in the right corner and thus far over the first four tests in 2023 i'm on par or a little bit below where i was for 2022 with an average in 2023 of 33.6 years now i compared 2020 to 2023 data using a two sample t-test so when we look at the 12 tests over 2020 to 2021 versus or compared with 2022 to 2023 the 11 tests so far over those two years that's a significant reduction the the last 11 tests are significantly reduced when compared with the 12 tests from 2020 to 2021 you can see the p-value is less than 0.05 now fina wage levine's test isn't the only metric that i use to assess biological age i also use aging.ai so what's my aging.ai age so aging.ei is also free to use and it includes 19 biomarkers which we can see here so if anyone wants to double check the numbers you can enter it here using the north american data set so when entering these data i get a biological age of 31 years which is about 19 years younger than my chronological and just like we did for levine's test for more context let's have a look at previous data for aging.ai age which is what we can see here and so for aging.ai i have 41 blood tests since 2009. So from 2009 to 2013 i wasn't measuring very often only three times over a five year span and we can see that my average aging.ai age was 32 years over those three tests so then in 2016 in 2016 i started testing more often and from 2016 to 2022 i tested 34 times with an average aging.ai age of 29.8 years all right so what about 2023 so thus far over the first four tests with the latest test in gold my average aging.aih is also 29.8 years in other words my aging.aih has been stable the average aging.ai age has been stable for the past eight years so what may be contributing to these biological age reductions diet and or supplements and that will be in the next video that i'll release on wednesday july july 19th of 2023 but for now let's dig into the full blood test report which is what we can see here so a couple of highlights quest a flag my total white blood cells as low at 3.6 um about 3.6 000 white blood cells per microliter and that's because their reference range is 3 3.8 to 10.8 000 white blood cells per microliter but note that the reference range is generally not what's optimal for health and potentially longevity the reference range is just basically the normal distribution within a population it isn't intended to assess all cause mortality risk or at least not yet hopefully that'll change at some point in the future so to illustrate that point let's take a look at a study for white blood cell count in terms of survival rate plotted against years after the baseline white blood cell assessment so first when starting with 3 500 to 6000 white blood cells per microliter and when looking at median survival that's 0.05 survival that's a survival rate of 0.05 that's the time when half the population has died and half is still alive and i've said that so many times in animal studies so it's rare that we see this in a human study so when looking at media and survival we can see that those in the 3 500 to 6000 white blood cell count per microliter or 3.5 to 6 had a life expectancy of about 38 years in contrast six thousand to ten thousand white blood cells per microliter note again that's still within the reference range the quest labs reference range they had a significantly shorter life expectancy of about 30 years and then still for people who had white blood cell counts at the baseline visit of greater than 10 000 white blood cells per microliter again 10.8 is the upper limit of quest labs reference range so this is some of this is going to be within that range they had the shortest life expectancy of about 25 years so about a 13-year age life expectancy difference between people who had more than ten thousand white blood cells per microliter versus 3500 to 6 000. So what about less than 3 500 as my data is technically well not technically but it's right on that border at 3.6 so it looks like it's the shortest life expectancy of all the four groups but note that there were only 49 subjects in that group and that association wasn't statistically significant so from this from this study we can see that 3.5 to 6 or 3 500 to 6 000 white blood cells may be optimal in terms of life expectancy now note that just focusing on one test may not be the best way to assess all-cause mortality risk since 2015 i have 42 tests for white blood cell uh white blood cell levels and my average over those 42 tests is 4.6 so even though my 3.6 is right on that border of 3 500 to 6000 we can see that i'm right within that optimal range of 3 500 to 6000 at 4600 or 4.6 000 white blood cells per microliter now something else i want to point out is or ask is are neutrophils too low we can see that for this test they were 15 19 and quest reference range is 1500 to 7 800. So i'm right on that border based on their reference range so to assess that let's take a look at all cause mortality risk as shown here plotted against neutrophil counts on the y-axis and when compared with two to three or two thousand to three thousand neutrophils per microliter which was defined as the reference we can see that having higher than 3 000 neutrophils per microliter was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk we can see that the confidence interval the 95 confidence confidence interval the data that's in parentheses is completely above the hazard ratio of one similarly neutrophils that were less than 2000 or 2 times you know 10 to the three neutrophils per microliter was also associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so from this study we can see that two thousand to three thousand neutrophils may be optimal in terms of all cause mortality risk so note that that again the reference range includes some of the increased all-cause mortality risk from 1500 to 2000 but also from three thousand to seventy eight hundred so once again we can see that the reference range is generally not what's optimal for health and potentially longevity and also based on this study my 1519 would put me at an increased all-cause mortality risk sorry an increased all-cause mortality risk but i'm not too worried about that it's just one test and if we look at my 42 test average for neutrophils since 2015 it's 22.99 right within that 2000 or 3000 range all right finishing up the blood test we can see the lipid panel hscrp and glucose all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you maybe may be interested in including at home metabolomics any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics as it includes for example apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
