# Pneumonia Is A Major Cause of Death In Centenarians: Reducing Risk Via The Gut Microbiome

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

With the goal of living past 100 it's important to know what centenarians die from so that we can minimize that risk so what's the number one cause of death in centenarians let's have a look at some data so uh that's we can see here uh uh death for all causes for people old people older than 100 years old and this is a sample size of about 30 36 000 centenarians so uh first the uh major cause of death in centenarians was old age about 28 of all deaths in in the group that was older than 100 years died from what they what was classified as old age which can be literally anything so what about cause specific mortality like heart disease and cancer this would be the obvious choice so we can see that uh for heart disease eight point six percent of all people who died that were older than a hundred uh died from heart disease and uh about four out of a hundred uh died from cancer so these aren't the primary causes of death in people older than a hundred years what is so we can see that 18 about 18 percent of the deaths for centenarians was related to pneumonia so if we're going to live past 100 years we need to account for uh pneumonia and optimize strategies to reduce risk of pneumonia at older ages so is this a an effect specific to centenarians or is this uh also occurring at uh relatively younger ages so in this case i've rectangled starting at 80 years old all the way up to 100 years old and what we can see is that uh pneumonia the the incidence of deaths for pneumonia increases during aging so for the 80 year old group uh pneumonia uh the percentage of deaths from pneumonia are only about six percent of all deaths and then they increase in each five-year increment all the way up to a hundred years so six percent to eight point three percent eleven and a half to fourteen percent fourteen point six percent and then finally the centenarians at that about 18 of all deaths related to pneumonia so uh interestingly also during that time from 80 to 100 plus the there's a reduction in both uh deaths from heart disease and cancer so we can see deaths from heart disease go from nineteen percent down to that nine percent around nine percent in centenarians and similarly for cancer uh that's decreased from about 24 and a half percent in the 80 year olds to 4.4 percent in the centenarian so it looks like centenarians escape death from heart disease and cancer but then die at an increased rate from pneumonia so what is pneumonia so just as a brief overview it's simply an infection of the lung or lungs which leads to inflammation difficulty breathing and then all the complications that come with that now in this study the uh pneumonia was designated uh with the icd-10 codes j-12 through j-118 which includes both viral and bacterial pneumonia so in today's video i'm going to talk about uh strategies to optimize against viral pneumonia in this case caused by influenza the influenza a virus and bacterial pneumonia in this case klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria so what interventions uh can we use to improve survival following viral or bacterial lung infection so first as we can see by the title there's improved survival following viral lung infection and mice on a high soluble fiber diet so what's what's what does that even mean what's a high soluble fiber diet so dietary fiber is comprised of insoluble fiber which is not fermented by gut bacteria and soluble fiber which is fermented by gut bacteria to form the short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate so why are they called short chain fatty acids so acetate is a two carbon fatty acid ch3cooh propionate a three carbon fatty acid and butyrate a4 carbon fatty acid so relative to other fatty acids in terms of carbon chain length they are short so okay so improve survival uh after uh consumption of a high cyber fiber diet after influenza a lung infection so that's we're looking at here and this data is in young female mice for whatever reason they didn't uh look at survival in male mice they only use female mice so we're looking at survival plotted against time after infection and comparing control fit animals versus a high fiber diet so in this case the controls consumed 30 of their diet from cellulose which is a poorly fermentable fiber it's not fermented by gut bacteria and 30 inulin which is a soluble fiber which is fermented by gut bacteria to produce the short chain fatty acids so what happened for both these groups so when looking at average survival that's the time when half the cohort is alive and half has died so 50 survival is indicative of that and we can see that for the animals on the control diet 50 of our average survival was at about nine days so uh in contrast mice that were on the high soluble fiber diet live significantly longer 14 days um which suggests an important role for soluble fiber on improving defense against viral lung infection so when considering that soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria to make short chain fatty acids is the improved survival mediated by these short chain fatty acids so first we have to see if the short chain fatty acids are actually elevated as a result of the high cyber fiber diet so that's what we're looking at here fecal uh so levels of these short chain fatty acids in uh stool samples on the left and then plasma levels of the short chain fatty acids on the right so the the gut bacteria are located in the colon or large intestine and then they would be uh absorbed into the intestinal epithelial cells where they then can pass into the blood that's how they would get into the plasma so first on the left notice that in in the fecal samples short chain the short chain fatty acids acetate was twofold higher in the inulin uh soluble fiber fed mice compared to controls but then butyrate noticed the increase of about 150 fold relative to the control fed animals so a similar trend is found for the plasma short chain fatty acids so again acetate in plasma was about two fold elevated uh as a result of the high soluble fiber diet propinate was now significant increase in in plasma but then again butyrate was increased almost 150 fold compared to the control diet and again this is in the influenza a infected mice so when considering that butyrate was tremendously increased on the high cyber fiber diet and uh and the high cyber fiber fed mice had an increased survival after a viral lung infection this led the authors of this study to ask can individual short chain fatty acids impact survival following infection with influenza and to do that they looked at butyrate so what we're looking at here is survival after again influenza a infection lung infection with the influenza virus and again in young female mice and we're looking at survival so in one group the mice were just given water and in the other group they were given butyrate in the water so they were drinking water that was that had butyrate in it and when we look at average survival we can see that for the mice that only had water average survival after influenza viral lung infection was about eight days so in contrast average survival for butyrate treated mice was double uh you know 17 or more than double 17 days after being infected with influenza a so that suggests that high sob high soluble fiber diet increase in the gut bacteria production of the short chain fatty acid fatty acids sorry which can then improve our our ability to survive after a viral lung infection so what about survival after a bacterial lung infection and as i mentioned i'm going to show data for klebsiella pneumoniae and that's what we can see here so survival after bacterial infection with klebsiella bacteria and first when looking at the vehicle treated mice so mice that were not treated with any of the short chain fatty acids we can see that average survival after bacterial lung infection was at about 80 hours so what about the butyrate treated mice and that's the green line and we can see that all of the butyrate treated mice were still alive after 80 hours after infection with klebsiella bacteria which strongly suggests a protective role for these short-chain fatty acids in the lung you know the lungs defense against uh infection so uh is there a link but now these data are in mice is there a link between fiber intake with pneumonia in people so a relatively high fiber diet is associated with a reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases now it's important to note that death from respiratory diseases which i've rectangled here uh the icd codes include included j-10 through j-18 and also j-40 to j-47 which includes viral and bacterial pneumonia but also other respiratory diseases too like copd so this these data from death from respiratory diseases isn't specific to pneumonia but uh from all respiratory related deaths so was there a protective role for fiber or association for a protective role for fiber in these studies so first in looking at the data for men and looking at the fully adjusted model we can see that men that consumed the highest amount of fiber in the study 29 grams had a 31 a significantly reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases of 31 when compared with men that compared uh consumed the lowest amount of fiber 12.6 percent uh it's 12.6 grams sorry so uh and actually uh starting from quintile 4 of fiber intake so somewhere above 19 grams per day was associated with a 26 reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases when compared with the lower fiber group so a similar effect is present for women only in this case women that consumed above the 12.6 grams sorry 10.8 grams so that was considered low fiber in quintile one so quintile two for fiber consumption slightly higher than quintile one had a 19 reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases and then every quintile above that had a further reduction in risk of death from respiratory diseases so quintile 3 27 down quintile 4 42 down quintile 5 46 down so the highest fiber group of 25 grams about about 25 grams per day versus about 11 grams per day in women significantly reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases now based on all the data that i've shown you this suggested a high fiber diet and more specifically soluble fiber may be an important approach for reducing risk of death from respiratory diseases including pneumonia now it's also important to note that there are no rcts randomized controlled trials that have directly tested this hypothesis in older adults so the data has yet to be seen if this will actually be proven in in studies of older adults that have pneumonia all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for uh for watching and listening and have a great day
