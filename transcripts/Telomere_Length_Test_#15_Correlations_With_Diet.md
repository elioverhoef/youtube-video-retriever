# Telomere Length Test #15: Correlations With Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tiir shortening is a hallmark of aging even worse though tiir shortening negatively impacts other hallmarks including genomic instability mitochondrial dysfunction and stem cell exhaustion more specifically teir length declines during aging for both men and women on the y- axis we've got ltl or lucy tiir length this is tiir length inside of white blood cells plotted against age from 20 to about 100 years old and then we can see that age related decline for both men and women with average values of around 7.75 kilobases in youth whereas an advanced age closer to five kilobases more specifically in centenarians or 100y olds now a central premise of the channel is to slow aging by optimizing biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and tiir length is on that list now i currently have 15 tmr tests that date back to 2022 so in this video we'll over what's my data and additionally which factors are significantly correlated with tiir length with the goal of getting them as close to youthful as possible so first what's my data to find out a simpl to true diagnostic if you want to measure your own tm length discount link in the video's description now on to the data on the y- ais we've got talir length plotted against the collection date in 2022 over three tests average tail length was 7.05 kilobases and then i started testing more often such that in 2023 the average was 7.13 kilobases now i could stop here and say hey look i've reversed tailor length but the fact is i don't know if three tests in 2022 is representative of a full year full year's worth of data whereas in 2023 that's probably closer to a full year's worth of data as eight tests is a lot relative to the three test in 2022 all right so what about in 2024 so thus far the average in 2024 is off to a good start 7.12 kilobases but all is not great because for the last test in may uh uh may 28 2024 it was 7.07 kilobases and for two other tests three of the last five tests we can see that tm length was 7.06 and 7.08 kilobases which is closer to the 2022 data than 7.13 kilobases or above now these data at least the most recent data three of the last five tests suggest that i have a lot of room for progress to get back to that 7.75 kilobase value that's found more likely in youth so this is technically a weak spot right now in my data and i think it's instructive to show the good and the bad and how i intend to improve uh current weak spots so with that in mind can tiir length be further improved so to address that which factors are significantly correlated with tiir length and not in published studies and others in my own data so what's the approach so for those who are familiar with the channel apologies if you've seen this approach a billion times there may be people who are new who haven't seen it so since 2015 i've weighed all of my food with a food scale and then i enter those daily food amounts into chronometer discount link below for chronometer if you want to use it yourself and then i manually enter those data into a spreadsheet so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests i take the 50-day average dietary intake and that then lines up with tm length or any other biomarkers that i measured on that day and then i can calculate correlations for diet and even supplements with biomarkers so with that in mind i took a look at 97 comparisons for tm length with foods macro and micronutrients with the top portion of that list shown here and the full correlation list as all of the correlations are on patreon in a specific tier so on to the list in the middle we've got the correlation coefficient lowercase r and then on the right we've got the p value as the measure of statistical significance and we can see that each of the uh foods or nutrients that are on this list have a p value less than 0.05 as the measure of statistical significance a top the list are cloves with a correlation coefficient of 0.7 which suggests that a relatively higher clove intake in my data is significantly correlated with a longer t length and again i'm not trying to imply causation these are correlations so going beyond cloves broccoli calcium salt and onions onion intake are significantly correlated with a longer tm length over those 15 tests conversely trimethyl glycine and this isn't supplemental tri trimethyl glycine uh and although chronometer doesn't track it based on published uh data on pubmed i track it on my own as it's say methylone or trimethyl glycine it has three methyl groups so i've been tracking methyl groups uh methyl group intake to potentially impact epigenetic age whether denum pace or horvath so dietary intake of trimethyl glycine the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio note that my ratio isn't anything too crazy it's always less than 2: one zinc and saturated fatty acids sfas are significally correlated with a shorter tmr length all right so what do i do with this data with the goal of optimizing tm length i don't know if any of these or all of these are related to increasing or shortening t length so the goal is to follow as many of the correlations as possible so with that in mind for the next test i've pushed cloves broccoli calcium uh and onions while reducing saturated fatty acid intake mostly from coconut butter so i've made those five changes towards the higher end or lower end of my range respectively so higher for the greens and lower for the reds i.e saturated fatty acids now what will happen after i retest test so after i retest i then recalculate the correlations based on that data and then spous correlations will weaken so what that means is if cloves aren't significantly correlated or aren't involved in mechanisms that impact tm length if i increase them and teir length doesn't further increase or stay relatively high that suggests that cloves are not directly involved in mechanisms that impact t length so its correlation will weaken it will be less than 0.7 so using that approach the spous correlations will weaken and the correlations that may be positively involved and again emphasis on maybe the only way to find out is by continuously doing this experiment over and over and over until i have enough data for the story to become more clear so that's the approach the next test is scheduled for about two weeks from now so stay tuned for that update video coming sometime sometime in september all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with side fox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
