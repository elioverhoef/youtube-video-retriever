# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #3 in 2021

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so with that in mind if we track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind last week i blood tested for the third time in 2021 and using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is also a measure of biological age we can see that my biological age was 35.2 years which is 13.2 years younger than my chronological age of 48 and a half so a question that is often raised when i show this data is how good is levine's biological age calculator so we can see here its correlation with chronological age is very strong so the combination of these nine biomarkers and chronological age because that's what's included in the test uh were strongly correlated with a chronological age in two separate studies in nhanes three which is the national health and nutrition examination survey so enhance three a correlation of 0.94 for for the fiends test with chronological age and then in a separate study enhance four uh correlation of 0.96 for these uh nine variables with chronological eight so very strong correlations a correlation coefficient of one is it is as good as it gets and as you can see by the red line on the graph it's an almost perfectly linear correlation for these biomarkers with chronological age so another question that's often raised is how does levine's test compare with the best epigenetic clocks for its correlation with biological age so the best performing epigenetic clock in terms of its correlation with chronological age is the horvath clock and here we're looking at a multi-tissue measure of epigenetic age also known as which is also a measure of biological age for horvath's clock with these 16 different cell and organ and uh blood uh types uh you know so breast cheek uh cerebellum cells so brain colon cord blood skin dermis etc so when looking at all 16 different cell types we can see that the composite of all of that horvath's clock is very strongly correlated with uh horvath's epigenetic measurement is strongly correlated with chronological age in the composite of those 16 different cell types with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 now levine's test that worst also has a correlation coefficient of 0.94 with chronological age so one could argue that levine's test is just as good as the best epigenetic clock for its correlation with chronological age now levine's test isn't just a good measure of a chronological age it's also associated with all-cause mortality risk so for every one year increase in biological age all-cause mortality risk increases by nine percent and that's what's shown here so first when looking at the all-cause mortality data you can see that the hazard ratio is 1.09 which means that that's a 9 increase in risk of death for all causes for every one year increase in the veen's biological age test now that uh that association is true whether it's young middle aged or older adults as indicated by the arrows as you can see that there's a 13 percent and eight percent uh increase for all-cause mortality risk if you're young middle-aged or older for every one-year increase in levine's biological age now what about disease-specific mortality not just death from all causes and that's what's shown here so having an older biological age by levine's test is associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease interestingly not cerebral cerebral vascular disease or stroke diabetes related mortality uh influenza or pneumonia and as a side note levine's group published last year that having an older biological age up to 14 years before the coronavirus hit was associated with an increased mortality risk in covid19 patients and then last but not least having an older biological age by levine's test is associated with kidney related mortality including from nephritis or nephrosis now it's important to note that levene's test isn't the only blood blood-based biopar sorry blood-based biomarker panel that can easily assess and when i see easily assess i mean it's uh free to use online you just put in your numbers and you get the result for your biological age so it's not the only test that can easily assess biological age and potentially all cause mortality risk and another test that is uh freely free to use online is aging.ai which has been shown to be strongly correlated with biological age and what differentiates it from levine's test is that chronological age is not included as a variable in its model so the aging.ei test includes 19 different blood-based biomarkers which are found on the standard chemistry panel in a complete blood count cbc and that test those two tests combined uh go for about 35 or less in u.s dollars now for eight of the nine measures on levene's test the standard chemistry panel in cbc will also be covered we'll also cover that with the exception of a high sensitivity c-reactor protein which is an additional test that can go up to for up to about 40 40 to 45 dollars so for the beans test it could cost at most about eighty dollars for aging.ai at most up to thirty five dollars uh at least in u.s dollars now as i mentioned uh aging.ai is has been shown to be strongly correlated at least for the 19 biomarker panel for aging.ei it's been shown to be strongly correlated with chronological age and as you can see a correlation coefficient of 0.8 so it's not quite as good as levine's test but a correlation coefficient of 0.8 is still very strong and then it's also been shown to be uh associated with uh an increased all-cause mortality risk so in other words biological ages that were younger than their corresponding chronological age were associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk and we can see uh that data here in two different data sets so first starting with the canadian cohort uh people that had a biological age by aging.ai that was more than five years older than their chronological age had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk is indicated there by the arrow for the hazard ratio closer uh to two and then conversely for people who had aging.ai determined biological ages that were at least five years younger than their chronological age we can see a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk and similar date similar data was also present in an american cohort again using the uh nhanes uh where we can see uh having a biological age that was more than five years older than the chronological again increased all-cause mortality risk and then conversely younger five years younger biological age compared with their chronological age they uh that was associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk so with all this in mind for aging.ai what's my data so here's my data for the blood test that i got done last week and for anyone who wants to double check my numbers my predicted age was 29 which is close to 20 years younger than my chronological age so i'm on the right track now uh with this in mind an obvious question is what's contributing to my relatively low biological age whether using levene's test or aging.ai so first in terms of supplements i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early to mid 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine for about 20 years daily and that's 137.5 micrograms per day so and then from the last blood test in late april until this blood test so it's an 84 day period i've been taking a thousand micrograms of methyl b12 every other day so that's it for supplements everything else is is uh diet exercise and body composition so in terms of fitness stats uh what does that look like and how is that potentially impacting my biological age so first in terms of my body weight i'm currently 156.7 pounds and i should mention that's my average body weight for the 84 day period that goes from my last blood test to this blood test as i weigh myself every morning so that's the average body weight over that uh period that goes from my last blood test to this blood test and the resulting bmi is 24 and a half so i'm within that quote-unquote normal range up to about 25 and then my in terms of cardiovascular in terms of fitness stats that related to cardiovascular health the resting heart rate rhr and heart rate variability hrv are shown there 47.1 beats per minute for resting heart rate and 52.7 milliseconds for heart rate variability uh now i'm not going to show any data related to strength flexibility uh core function etc i'll i think it's easier to show that visually so people can visually see you know my strength and flexibility uh but in terms of cardiovascular related metrics those are easy relatively easier to show so that's what i'm showing here and again that data is generated by my fitness tracker uh i'm not sponsored by them but i wear whoop you can get this data from many different fitness trackers i'm not here to say which one is better or not now then the question is is are these cardiovascular fitness metrics uh resting heart rate heart rate variability contributing to my relatively young biological age so let's take it some take a look at some resting heart rate data and this is whoop data so that would be the appropriate measurement right if i have my own data from whoop how would i compare to uh to whoop members uh and so we're looking at average resting heart rate on the y axis plotted against the age and the age range here goes from 20 year olds up to 50. So we can see that youth is characterized by relatively lower resting heart rates in men uh for men in blue we can see resting heart rates of about 53 ish uh for 20 year olds and for women in red we can see a little bit higher uh wrestling heart rates of about 56 but for both men and women we can see clearly see that resting heart rates increase from 20 to 50 year olds uh uh so resting heart rate increases during aging at least up to 50. Now my resting heart rate is 47.1 so based on extrapolation of the curve one could argue argue that i've got a youthful uh resting heart rate uh but then going further is a low resting heart rate associated with health so one way we can assess that is by looking at the association for resting heart rate with all-cause mortality risk and i presented this data in in other videos so if you've seen that i apologize for those of you who haven't seen it uh here it is so on the y-axis we're looking at the rr relative risk for all-cause mortality and on the x-axis is resting heart rate in beats per minute and this is a meta-analysis of 46 studies that included almost what that included more than 1.2 million subjects and what we can see is that the lowest risk for all-cause mortality was present for resting heart rates of 45 and then all-cause mortality risk significantly increased as the uh it went as the resting heart rate went past 45 and towards higher values so when looking at both of these data the uh youthful resting heart rate of 47.1 when compared with the whoop data and then the all-cause mortality data one would one could argue that i'm on the right track and this may be a contributing factor for uh my relatively youthful biological age but there's a caveat here a resting heart rate increases then decreases during aging so at whereas the whoop data only goes up to 50 here we're looking at fitbit data where uh they included the age range up to uh people who are 85 years and in agreement with the woop data we can see that resting heart rate does indeed increase up until about 50 years but then from 50 to 85 we can see that resting heart rate decreases during aging so an obvious question then is how can we know if a low resting heart rate is indicative of health or is relatively low because of aging and one way we can assess that is by looking at the heart rate variability data and the combination of those two can can provide more insight about cardiovascular fitness so uh first just to introduce heart rate variability and again for those of you have seen my video on this i apologize but for those of you who are new and who haven't seen it let's go through it so what is heart rate variability hrv it's this variation in time in between successive heartbeats so that may not be intuitive in terms of what it means so uh if your heart average heart rate is 60 beats per minute you know it's easy to think that your heart beats exactly one beat per second but there is a variability for each beat the time for each beat you may have point nine seconds per beat 1.1 seconds per beat one second per beat and then that three beat average would be uh one beat per minute but there is a variability in the time in between those beats so that's what's illustrated here and and based on the the the the heart rate very heart rate variability that's presented there 859 793 726 milliseconds uh for the time in between each beat you would get a heart rate variability of 67 milliseconds so uh with this in mind how does heart rate variability change during aging so a higher heart rate variability is found in youth but it declines during aging and this again is whoop data and if people are interested i'll put the link where all of this data and for all the studies that i've presented here it'll be in the video's description and i should mention too i'll put a link to levine's test and aging.iii in the videos description i'm not sponsored by either of them so they're free to use uh you know uh tools so we can see that the heart rate variability going from 20 years old to 65 years old declines from about 80 and 20 years old to about 35 40 in 65 years old now my average heart rate variability over the 84 day period for my last blood test it through this blood test where because i measured every day was 52.7 milliseconds so first looking at the uh my age group so i'm currently 48 and a half uh that would put me closer to the high end of or the highest end of the range for my age group at worst but at best uh i may be at the bottom of the range for uh you know 23 year old or so and it's impossible to know where exactly i i fit on that graph in terms of uh how much younger uh you know where i stand in terms of uh my heart rate variability on this chart you know is it a 35 year old am i in the middle of the chart for 35 year old there's no way to know but when considering that i'm above the median for my age and potentially younger one could argue that my heart rate variability data is potentially contributing to a younger biological age so as that summary uh you know as i mentioned in my case relative heart wrestling heart rate is relatively low in conjunction with a heart rate variability that is higher than the median for my age at worst or at the low end of the range for a 23 year old at best now note that a relatively low resting heart rate and high heart rate variability are found in youth and conversely relatively lower heart rate very wrestling heart rate and low heart rate variability are found in older adults so to answer that question is cardiovascular fitness contributing to a relatively young biological age in my case i'd argue that my data would suggest that i'm closer to the low rhr and high hrv that are found in youth now in support of that uh if my average heart rate variability was you know 30 or so towards the lower end of the range for at least my age group one could make the argument that my relatively low resting heart rate in combination with this low heart rate variability would be indicative of poor cardiovascular fitness and then having a youthful biological age in that case would be in spite of having poor cardiovascular fitness but that does not seem to be the case in my situation so the next uh issue would then be what about diet and in the interest of time i'm gonna stop here this will be a part two of this series uh and i'll go through full diet composition and macro macro and micronutrients and and more in terms of looking at how i use diet to try to optimize each of these biomarkers now as a last note i'm now on patreon and uh there you'll find that exclusive information that i don't post anywhere else including daily data and not just the average data over an 84 day period for my resting heart rate heart heart rate variability sleep stages and then diet daily diet data where i take screenshots of all the stuff that's in my diet for food intake including my macro micronutrients and then sneak peeks at in spoilers for new videos i posted a couple of slides for this video yesterday and the day before so you kind of get some insight into what my videos are going to be and a lot more so if you're not interested in that you can find me lots of places online which i've posted here and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
