# NAD Test #3: Impact of 1000 mg NMN/d?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

What's my intracellular level of nad to sort that out on january 23rd of 2023 i sent blood for analysis to ginfinity precision medicine and we saw that my nad level was 25.6 micromolar which then raises the question is that value youthful or aged so when using ginfinity's data for how nad levels change during aging we saw that it was in the aged category so with that in mind i supplemented with 300 milligrams per day of nmn for the next 21 days as soon as get as soon as i got the data after test number one retesting on february 21st of 2023 and if you're interested in why i used nmn instead of niacin i covered that in an earlier video which will be in the right corner so then using 300 milligrams per day of nmn we saw that my intracellular level of nad was essentially the same 25.3 micromolar so no effect so i decided to further increase nmn going with one gram per day or 1000 milligrams of nmn per day for one week and i retested on march 5th of 2023 so what was the impact on nad and here we can see that i finally got an increase for my intracellular level of nad as it went up to 39.3 micromolar and now i would be close in the close to youthful range as values greater than 40 micromolar would be expected to be found to people younger than 30 years old but now for the caveats first a higher nad level because i sent these data on the same day that i did a full blood panel there was no change for blood biomarker-based biological age including levine's test and aging.ai in contrary to an earlier hypothesis that i pitched in in a separate video where i thought that having higher nad could potentially impact dhea sulfate there was no impact on dhea sulfate as it was 129 micrograms per deciliter which is within the range of where it usually is but if there is a reason for hope it's possible that higher nad impacted my epigenetic age as i sent blood for epigenetic analysis to true diagnostic on the same day that i did this test so it's possible that having higher nad impacted my epigenetic age so i don't yet have that data i expect to have it either late this month or early in april so stay tuned for that update video coming soon all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for nad quantification as covered in this video green tea epigenetic testing with true diagnostic oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
