## Transcript

Hey everybody welcome to the channel uh today we've got something a bit different this is the conquer aging or diet trying podcast episode one and today we've got chris man lumis who is a former ai programmer a mathematician health and longevity researcher and uh he's the owner and operator of unaging aging.com so if you're interested in that check out his site uh so we we've got a lot to go through and uh where should we start chris and welome see you uh thank you it's uh i'm uh really happy to be talking to you um we've been uh talking back and forth a while having great conversations and um what i was really interested and struck by is that we have sort of a similar routine in a lot of ways and so i think where we should start from is how uh kind of what the philosophy is like how do you decide what it is that you want to add to your routine if you're looking at a food or an exercise or a habit how do you what what's your what's your benchmark what's your weighing point for deciding what you want to do to live the longest healthiest life you can so i'll put it over to you first yeah so uh starting with the um the five habits that get life expectancy to an average of around 90 years both women and men and for those who don't know i'll link to all the papers that we're going to talk about in the video's description uh so check that out if you're interested but those included a bmi less than 25 okay check um not smoking check moderate alcohol intake so i'm not on that and we can discuss why um but i'm not opposed to alcohol intake it's just it's almost never thing um and then exercise exercise dose so getting more than six hours per week i'm just below that i'm in the uh four to six hour range so i'm just below and then a quote unquote healthy diet by the uh alternative healthy diet uh eating index having a high dietary score versus a low dietary score puts you in the highest uh category all right so that's just getting you to 90 so as you know the name in the channel is conquer aging or die trying so you know we've got to find ways beyond just those general recommendations to potentially push that curve out further so where i see the two biggest places to to impact um maybe potentially three uh with you know specifically titrating bmi is you know bmi of 24 versus 21 that's very debatable but we could even get into how would i or others potentially decide what is the best bm i that potentially maximizes their health and maybe longevity but i see the two biggest places to intervene as exercise dose and uh diet quality and even going f beyond what's uh you know touted as the high diet dietary quality so um so which which subdivision do you want to take there first the dietary quality or the exercise dose well uh let's see let me uh let me answer my own question first um oh by the way um as you you might notice i have a walking desk and uh a background for that so nice day for a walk in the park today um so uh like when i when i first started to read your stuff i think i might even found your content um because i was looking for sort of a blood um aging a blood test uh to figure out what age you are according to your blood test results um so getting your normal uh blood panel and being able to look at that and then from seeing that i' i've seen that a lot of your stuff you're looking very closely at sort of the um epigenetic uh indicators or other things and the testing things so um for myself my background is not um i'm not a medical degree i'm more on the analytical uh doctor side or the um quantitative mathematical side of things so what i'm looking for when i'm looking at an intervention um and i'm well familiar also with the uh the five factors that you talk about and they're a great place to start from and so for going beyond that how to get beyond 90 years old i'm looking for things that will affect all cause mortality so um this is the best sort of general criteria across the board there's so many so much advice out there about what you can do in order to live longer and it's really hard to prioritize you could spend uh you could make it your entire job or like some people like brian johnson has in fact made it almost his entire job just trying to keep up with all the innovations but without knowing which one's the most important it's um it it can become confusing so i try to dring everything back into epidemiological study of some kind that shows how much it actually increases or your lifespan by reducing premature death and then take a look at that so when i'm looking at my interventions i'm always looking at what's the effect on all cause mortality does it reduce premature death and if so by how much and then i can model that to say okay well this is more important than this and then also put it in yeah but that takes more time or whatever and then that's how i decide what i want to do and i think on that one i think we should start um to answer your question i think we should start with the physical activity the exercise wait so before going there i just that obviously all cause mortality data is a humongous part uh of my approach but it gets to the idea of okay general recommendations are good taking that a step further all cause mortality data but then even taking that a step further i integrate how a given biomarker changes during aging uh so for example before going into that um fruit and vegetable intake has been you know in epidemiological studies shows that um risk all cause mortality risk is maximally reduced somewhere between five and 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day but what if your total intake of fruits and vegetables is far beyond that what if it's 20 or 30 or whatever servings per day beyond what's been published right so now you're in this quote unquote healthy user bias group where there is no data so how do you how do you push beyond the uh epidemiological studies when there's no data which gets into the also a big part of my approach which is biomarkers and looking at as many biomarkers of organ and systemic function as possible now even there there's nuance because the reference range isn't the quote unquote optimal range because it isn't designed for health and longevity it's just are you in that range and if you're outside potentially it's disease and if you're below the range it's potentially disease but you may be getting progressively worse in that range increasing or decreasing over many years still within the range so i look at the aging data for a given biomarker and its all cause mortality data to come up with a what's optimal uh and then in addition well what's youth what what's youthful and then try to push all of my data which for most people pro probably think you can't change these things or slow these things down but the fact is they can be measured so uh i use diet and exercise and trying to optimize sleep sleep and whatever supplements right to try to optimize kidney and liver and cardiovascular everything comprehensively not just metabolic health uh but with the goal of having as youthful of a biochemistry as possible for as long as possible so okay with that in mind i guess we get into the yeah exercise dose right so now and and that's um you're right like your approach is uh that's why i enjoy talking to you one of the reasons i enjoy talking to you so much is because it gives some immediate visibility beyond what you can find epidemiological studies for right like you're saying okay um for some of the those the ranges are based off of basically are you average right and we're trying to shoot for far beyond average so so right in the area of uh physical activity of exercise so um i think the the study that you talked about is a great example the um the the um harvard the um chan harvard public health study where they go through that and they talk about uh getting a certain amount of exercise and the people who are in the highest quintile of exercise got around eight more years of life right it was the most significant i mean after not smoking a lot it was the most important intervention that they were able to make um but i think that that's a a good example where um the government suggestion is going to get you average right generally what you'll hear is you'll hear something like you should get around 150 minutes of medium or high-intensity exercise in a week right and then that then says okay well if it's if it's high intensity then maybe 75 or so but um from going through the studies to say okay what's the effect on all cause mortality i find that there's actually uh very different categories within exercise that need to be hit um just as doing 150 minutes is going to get you some benefit if you actually break it down and you say okay i'm going to do this much strength training i'm going to do this much aerobic training and then i'm going to do this much high-intensity interval training i think that you can put the pieces together and get more benefit in terms of all cause mortality specifically in reduction of premature death than if you were to just i don't know uh play soccer for 150 minutes yeah i i hear that that's a more specific approach than just general recommend based on how many hours of your are you exercising and dividing it into resistance training cardio etc but if you look at the graded dose uh on that curve where people who are in the i think three and a half or four to six hours and then more than six hours per week of moderate to vigorous exercise per week which moderate includes just walking right so the the four to six hour per week group was about six hours of in increased life expectancy and as you mentioned eight years for the greater than six hours no matter how you how you cut that it seems like there's a graded response just at least in terms of duration but what's going to be the uh life expectancy gain for the subdivision that you mentioned when considering that you know we're going from six hours uh six years to eight years is it going to be 15 years is it going to be 20 i don't see a big jump coming from that which then i know i'm going to sound like a broken record which goes down to specificity how can we get more you know i hear what you're saying which kind of gets us on that road towards more precise uh dose right but this comes down to biomarkers right and and how would you how would you know what the appropriate amount of res resistance training for you and you know cardio for you right and all of the total duration for you for some people maybe they do great on 10 hours total exercise per week no matter how you cut it up right some people may be doing doing better on three hours per week and i say better by looking the full complement of all their biomarkers not just strength and v2 max but like kidney and liver and you know inflammation etc so that's how i look at it now the the argument against that is there's no published data on what kind of life expectancy gain will you get by using a biomarker driven approach to titrate exercise dose there's just no data it doesn't exist right so this is where i'm okay to differ from everybody and you know you know so now we can have a bell bell curve distribution where my data will be an outlier because there's no no previous data to guide me on that right so i'm either going to be on the left side which it was a disaster i'll have an average benefit or i'll maybe i'll have the greatest benefit you know maybe i'll push it to 15 years so um we can get into specifics because people are like what are the specifics how would you do that let's do it all right yeah so what what like yeah let's do the specifics what's your like in a one week what do you do how would you describe it i've seen i've seen your videos of course but it'd be for those who haven't them maybe to describe what's your workout routine yeah well it in addition to just the workout routine so i'm doing two work two right now it's two 90 minute workouts per week those workouts include um weightlifting calisthetics um mobility flexibility balance a little bit of taekwondo stuff just the goal is is to optimize muscle mass and function for as long as physically possible to attenuate any potential age related decline the workout is completely standardized i know exactly how many sets and reps of each movement that i'm doing these are compound movements i'm almost never doing bicep curls and tricep push downs you know these single joint movements it's you know pull-ups and push-ups off a ball you know um so for the extra resistance over shoulder press deadlifts um but so that 90-minute workout now after each 90-minute workout because i'm tracking things like heart rate variability and resting heart rate we've got to remember that exercise is a stressor and for those who are going to try to misinterpret my words i know that there are maybe some that are out there and i won't name names exercise is a stressor now i'm not saying that in a negative light it's a hormetic stressor which means in the short term that's chronic str that acute stress over the long term we will become more resilient against and uh develop our systems to better resist that stress now there's going to be an upper limit you know and i've used this analogy before you know in baseball there are some pitchers who can throw 200 innings 250 innings it used to be 300 innings in the 1970s and now baseball has been you know uh reduced to where we're afraid of your injury risk you know based on no data and then you've got 60 inning pitchers who try to get stretched out into 200 inning pitchers but then they get injured so they probably didn't have that genetics now the analogy of that story is are you a 60 inning pitcher are you a 200 inning pitcher are you a high volume uh uh exercise athlete are you a medium volume athlete what body what what uh what volume of exercise is best for your physiology so this goes to the idea of stress how much stress can your body tolerate now before before uh finishing that road i i've seen people say well just do more and continuously do more over time your body will adapt this is false th this may be true for a select amount of people but in tracking my own data even just looking at heart rate variability resting heart rate even looking at like you know deadlifts and squats and and volume of exercise for me there is a volume of exercise which optimizes strength and function over time and and if i go beyond that i'm increasing injury risk i'm overtrained and now i'm in that chronically stressed uh uh uh phys you know biochemistry where is that going to be best for optimizing maximum lifespan maybe i get an increase in average lifespan because we all know about the health benefits and and you know average lifespan increase for exercise but i want want to get to the maximum so i want to i want to get that hormetic dose i want to get that hormetic benefit in terms of health and average lifespan but i also want to minimize any over stress above that where now i'm reducing my ability to potentially get to the maximum so that that's the that's the long- winded nutshell okay yeah um so so from the biomarker point of view it's it's about tuning that kind of thing so from my point of view from looking at the all cause mort al it i'm very sensitive for each of those uh vectors um components that i talked about for the high intensity the aerobic and the strength training i'm very sensitive to when was the uh longevity benefit reached and maximized and after what point was it no longer helpful so um you talk about some people thinking that they want to run every inning every game all season long and uh actually i think uh we've had a bit of a discussion i'm not sure if you remember it where i've said i think you're doing too much at 90 minutes 180 minutes a week like uh my routine for exercise is actually um one is uh two 25 minute runs and then about a 40 about a half hour long strength training exercise interval and so my total time is actually under 90 minutes we but you're doing more in terms of the walking on the non-exercise days where on those days are quote unquote recovery days for me where it's very low volume yeah the the walking desk is uh is key for getting oh a 20,000 40,000 step day is uh pretty standard for me so along those lines on days where my step counts have been as high as that my resting heart rate and heart rate variability take a very long time to recover so when i first start when i first started on this journey in 2018 with the tracking the heart rate variability resting heart rate uh my data look chronically overtrained an average heart rate variability of 47 and an average resting heart rate of 51 now i was doing three hour workouts and i know people are gonna call bs on that but for whatever reason i and i me i've said this before i have i i have gorilla genetics where i just like throwing heavy weights around for a very long time i like i like the challenge of doing it for a very long time because it feels good to do like 10 sets of squats and you know 10 sets of of bench or whatever but it it was just murder on my you know and i felt you know cognitively felt terrible for like a week and then i couldn't make consistent strength gains even just maintaining strength by if i can't train for a week you know strength train that's not my optimum window just from trial and error for being able to maintain or increase it over time so um so i've cut that down a lot now in terms of the 90 minutes now being too much the argument against that is pull-ups all of my strength indices have not not declined uh at least over the past five years overhead press you know consecutive push-ups off the ball uh you know the rows all of the the the the you know the fitness metrics that i look at even flexibility nothing has declined if anything there's a small increase in certain areas and also a big part of that too is avoiding injury risk and i've had a history of uh lower b lower back herniations from eag lifting in my 20s so even that too i've been able to minimize that um so so the argument against that i'm currently still doing too much is no strength change no basically i've i've maintained strength now people can say oh you're maintaining strength but we both know you can't increase forever you're gonna you're going to hit that above average fitness level and then the trick is how long can you stay there right so that's one side of it the other side of it is the heart rate variability and resting heart rate as those measures of stress are uh both better significantly better not by a little bit by a lot over the past five years so if i was doing too much the argument would be well your metrics of overall stress um aren't aren't great you know so um so that's the argument against that i'm currently doing too much that's um yeah so let me let me refine my my point i don't think that you're doing enough to be harmful i think that you could get the same benefit even if you were to if you were to tune it more finely that you could maintain the same benefit i have the same i've been doing the weightlifting for about uh let's say i think it's about eight years now and have the same thing kind of reach the max and have held steady at that point um with just one weightlifting exercise uh term a week for about half an hour and i'm hitting the bigs like it's dead lips or squats um bench incline decline or flat and uh back exercise lat pull downs or rows or something else those are the big ones those are the key and that's all you need to do as you said no no bicep curls no like a try you know kind of push down kind of things but you hit the big ones and then that takes care of it weightlifting as you as you found out before has a kind of a sharp curve on it actually for the benefit um the studies will say as you sent over before and we can link in the comments that if you're exercising over two hours total time in a week you're actually not getting any more longevity out of it your premature death is now the same as if you'd never walked into the gym um but if you're doing a mix things like you're doing where you're getting your aerobic in there you're getting some other activities as well your weightlifting time it's within the right window as long as you're under an hour you're still getting the peak benefit out of it once you get over a total time of weightlifting strengthening loan in a week then it starts to you're no longer a peak and once you're over two hours now you're actually i think it's actually two and a half hours if i remember correctly then at that point it's worse than if you had never gone to the gym yeah i should clarify so it's not 90 minutes of all weightlifting it's far from that and i as i mentioned i've had to cut down the the training volume for the strength training portion of the workouts because there know it's just not i want to cover all of the bases and all of the movements from a variety of angles uh so you know for example for the for my overhead press i'm doing a warm-up set and basically two work sets right so so that's essentially for all of the compound movements at most it it's it's the same same idea it's like a warm-up set and then two work sets with kind of a pyramid the first work set is you know maybe 70% of 1rm and the second being 85 you know or so 85% or so higher so if i looked at total strength training as a portion of that it might be 45 minutes maybe maybe a bit less but then even then even then how do you quantify uh because it's almost like a circuit training workout too where it's a 90-minute workout and and granted it used to be an 80-minute workout and i have made it close to a 90-minute workout because i'm starting to i like i i like i said i like i like the challenge i like the challenge of pushing myself for as long as you know but again i have to follow the data and not not overtrain it but right you know if you looked at say say i'm doing 12 work sets total for the compound movements upper and lower body maybe it's 15 whatever it is total work time in each set is maybe one to two minutes you know i'm not doing like one rms i'm i'm trying to get you know the combination of strength and endurance like overhead press 70 times 12 rep like i'm not doing four reps or two reps so that may take one to two minutes at most so if i'm doing at most 15 works 15 sets total uh at one to two minutes that's like 30 minutes of strength of of actual movement time during strength train there's very little uh sitting around and and uh you know screwing off on the computer in between there's very little of that i try to minimize that as much as possible so um so yeah the actual strength training portion if we really quantified it as a small part and but yeah that's what works for me other people maybe can get away with doing more often more frequently now the other aspect of this and you know we've talked about this before is why not why not cut the workout up and you know split the routine over many days and now i've got to juggle with my inperson you know you know the deal but most people may not i've got juggle around the inperson work schedule and for whatever reason even just doing like a 45 minute workout or a shorter workout my data you know in terms of the fitness metrics may not be recovered enough and start to look overtrained the day after or the second day after where if i then include another workout so on a monday and then a wednesday when that friday comes to repeat the monday workout i may not be recovered enough and i'm i say may i've i've tried it in the past where then the friday workout which was supposed to be the second version of the monday workout i've got to push that to allow for recover and when i do that i start to throw the whole system off it it you know at most uh day one day five so monday friday i can maintain streng i that's what's work to maintain strength over time but if i get into six days after doing any portion of my workout and if that's a consistent thing over time um once every you know monday saturday monday sunday it's harder for me to maintain strength i start to see strength decrements uh and yeah so the long story short is i have to juggle around the inperson work schedule which dedicates some amount of you know uh heart rate increase which slows recovery uh and i'm getting no fitness benefit from it you know if i could make my own schedule and have my own you know uh time sheet for how often i would work out how much i would do i'd be able to get in hit on the on the non 90minut workout days uh and a lot more mobility work and joint work you know uh knees and ankles uh flexibility wise but in time that's for sure on the to-do list yeah so so that i think that covers sort of the strength training side of it um and the aerobic is like another key one um the aerobic can be done from what i've seen in the studies and also looking specifically at the mitochondria level where they're looking at the sort of the growth of mitochondria um the most important part about the aerobic is getting a regular dosage every week i like the studies seem to show that for the benefit for all cause mortality reduction basically happens at like after the first 15 minutes of aerobic and then after that it's pretty much flat and there are other benefits that come from the aerobic right like um there's sort of like the the energetic feeling of it lots of people just love running because they love running um but in the terms of all cause mortality you only see the benefit for like the first 15 minutes so i i do a 25 even i can't bring myself just to doing the minimum 15 minutes a week but about the 25 minutes of the aerobic um but that one that one it doesn't have the sharp curve like uh whiffing weights like you can very eas easily over stress your body lifting weights too much but people can run a lot and still be still be pretty good like for you your 90 minutes probably the stressful part of is probably more the weightlifting than the aerobic running would you would you agree with that does that sound right but it's a cumulative it's funny i i took a screenshot yesterday of my uh stress the you know the stress monitor that that whoop has right yeah look at if you look at it during the workout it's it's going up the whole time you know during my workout so the the argument there is it's it's you know it's a the whole workout just the duration of it it it's pretty i mean i guess it's pretty high intensity right so um right you're get you're getting cardiovascular drift that's what they call it where your heart rate just keeps on going up as you continue to run or jog right yeah but in terms of the um the 15 minutes that's for that's probably for high intensity for the hit training right whereas uh in terms of v2 max it's uh you know i think half of the benefit of v2 max is association with all cause mortality um it's like after a vo2 max of 40 most of the benefit is is up to about 40 and then there's a small you know it's like a 10% further reduction to go from a v2 max of 40 to 50 something like that so someone who's out there saying oh i'll only have to do 15 minutes a week of hit i mean the question is did it get your v2 max to at least 40 um to get most of the benefit for some people maybe that's not enough they may need more for whatever reason right so right the sort of the non-responder issue for that i mean the another another point that i um that i want to make that i kind of think of a lot is that there's oftentimes questions of okay well i don't walk as much as i think i should or i don't do as much of the aerobic as i should or i don't like going to the gym um but i do this other thing like okay i don't walk as much but i run for an hour or something like that and um from what i've read and seen from the studies they seem all to be different buckets so it's it's sort of like um like each of those activities like uh aerobic exercise high intensity exercise strength training and walking those are sort of what i consider to be the four fundamental components of physical activity for each of them you can get a certain amount of benefit out of doing them and if you don't do them you miss that benefit but there's no there's no makeup and there's no overlap like even if you're running let's say an hour a day you will still get additional longevity from walking another two hours a day right so each of them seem to be and in one way you could say that you're making up for it because some of the longevity you didn't get from that you can get from something else but you could have also eaten vegetables and fruits right so it's um it's interesting that the the components then seem to basically be different kind of aspect of some way of slowing down the aging process so that you can get the benefit from it so that's why you i think it's really important just break it down and making sure that you're hitting each of the buckets and at least getting the requisite amount inside of that the hit then is like another one and that's like um another about 15 minutes or so a week like you say and then regularly every week will give you another building for that and the v2 max will increase in other things so so i ie so this this is why i prefer specificity and which can kind of address that right so you know is the combination of that approach is that and then the amount of time spent and volume uh of training is that able to maintain your fitness level strength uh v2 max you know whatever cardiovascular fitness metrics you want to track heart rate variability resting heart rate etc blood pressure all the things that come with exercise is that total volume and frequency and intensity and duration is that enough to at least maintain it over time that's the big question then um so that's part of it you know the the other part of it is you know another as you said those are the four main pillars but another another aspect is and i think most people overlook it is mobility and flexibility training which if most and balance if you're not training that that stuff's going to get worse too and joint you know uh uh joint health right so the idea that you can just take um glucosamine or huran uronic acid or something and have quote unquote good joint health yeah okay maybe a little bit but we can you know there there are you pretty good youtube channels out there you know knees over toes that whole approach where you know you can um do a variety of movements aimed at increasing blood flow to your joints and increasing strength i you know in the joints which you know training through a full range of motion which unfortunately most people probably are ignoring um and even just focusing on like low back hamstring flexibility which as a former personal trainer you know training people in their 70s who never worked on these things that could barely flex you know uh just barely flex their their spine at that age from a lifetime of neglect i wouldn't just put it on strength and v2 max and you know running walking i would i wouldn't put it on that you know i it's it's it's mobility through a full range of motion and what's interesting too is if you look at older people who even even mildly fit people who ignored their mobility or or or you know joint of motion over time you know you can you can tell by just someone's movement pattern or their gate you know but from a lifetime of disuse you for example getting up off the floor how so you know and i don't mean sitting you know crisscross applesauce i mean just how how quickly can you get off the floor you know someone older chronologically older who's never trained if someone chronically old older who's actually mobile and has trained those things there's just a youthful aspect to it so independent of the strength and and and cardiovascular there's something about mobility balance and flexibility that there's a huge youthful component that i think most people ignore for example there's another guy uh i think his name is movements by david and his his catchphrase is stay flexy and this guy's mobility is fantastic i mean it's like gymnast i don't even want it's like cirus cir solle level and you know and one of his youtube videos is you know i'm small but i'm strong and if you look at the the feats of of mobility calisthenics that he's doing it's just um it's amazing so the long story short is i think that i that's why the part of my workout is is so long is i'm trying to incorporate i've always tried to incorporate some aspect of the mobility and joint and flexibility and balance uh but that's an easier said than done thing because you know uh we sit at a desk all day and long story short is the back can get tight so you got to do a lot i've got to do a lot to really warm it up and strengthen it and so h yeah the the balance is one that definitely um degrades as you get old um and the studies on it have not looked hopeful like when i've looked at the ones where they talk about your time say standing on one foot for the older people and older we're talking 80s and 90s not um not the new middle age of 50s uh they they're like measured in like under 10 seconds and when they do inter interventions at that age they really don't find any useful improvement so it does seem to be something that you really need to keep in one of the things i i can't even remember where i saw it is um uh brush your teeth with your eyes closed while doing the the yoga tree position right um so i ride my bicycle around and make sure that i'm always doing a certain amount of time riding with no hands like i did when i was a kid right just trying to make sure that i keep the balance up for the the stretching i i feel that i get enough of the stretching from the weightlifting like uh good squat will help your hamstrings and other things right and the studies show that actually they they do a head-to-head of stretching exercises and then strength training and they find that actually they got more increas in flexibility from doing the strength training than from actually doing a stretching exercise just to add on to that just so you're you're exactly right so doing a stret a weighted squat should have greater flexibility than doing an unweighted squat because you're basically pushing yourself you're forcing yourself down with extra gra right there are people who will only train to 90 de and that's not a full range of motion and we've been brainwashed i hate to pull the conspiracy theory garbage but you know we've we've been taught or we've heard it forever that you've only got to go to 90 degrees and how many bodybuilders have i seen that train to 90 degrees but that's not a full range of motion for for the for the squad right so sure you'll have better range of motion than if you didn't do any squats at all but there's ankle flexibility there's you know shoulder flexibility i mean these are all things that that can be trained to their full range of motion and then adding a strength training comp component to it um to to which if would should further improve uh flexibility in that movement so i've got room to go for some of those movements you es you know my my squats are pretty decent but i've got an ankle problem that goes back to being tackled at high school football you know almost i had a hairline fractured so my flexibility there isn't great so i've got to do a lot of work on my uh squat dep which is somewhat limited because of my ankle mobility but um yeah but in terms of the gain it for me it goes back to that you know that mobile phenotype right uh not just balance in the bike or balance with your eyes closed you know just uh it goes back to a you having a youthful movement pattern and that's not something you can just like deepo chopra and say i feel young so i'm young it's something i think has to be trained for a very long time you know i never want to get up off the floor and someone look at me and it's like my my parents like when i see them get up off the floor or a couch that's an old pattern and i'm not trying to be an agist or or you know that kind of boat but they they haven't trained it right and i could try my best to get up and look and look spry but without actively training it you know it's it's it's g to look aged you know so yeah i try i try and do um the other uh thing that i'll do is do some kind of tata workouts or something um sort of a very high-intensity work out and something like burpees inside of that right like a 20 seconds of burpees right where you're jumping as high as you can and then going down to a push-up and then jumping and that's that's the kind of thing that really gives you the mobility sort of the ability to dynamically react to the world around you um but uh yeah it's uh i keep it as a small part of mine but for you it's sort of a major thing especially if you have some injuries and things that sort of require a bit of attention to it i can understand that yeah but the other aspect of it too is for example like uh stretching stretching and strengthening the low back while also stretching and strengthening the hamstrings so for example doing like a like an l right where i'm i'm basically you know my body straight up and then i'm leaning forward like this right so it's kind of like a a good morning like that yeah but doing that now i'm holding awake holding 45 pound weight and you know i'm not touching the floor i'm just trying to hold this position for as long as i can so i'm getting that hamstring stretch and i'm also getting the strengthening in the lower back and the hamstrings but then i'll dip get rid of the 45 pound weight and i and then i'll you know i'll do the full even you know standing off a chair so i can get way beyond putting my knuckles to the floor so now i'm getting strength through a full range of motion so a little bit is you know warming up back but it's also strength through that full range of motion um you know touching my toes that that's not you know that's partial range of motion it's knuckles to the more and and even going further beyond that but also adding that weight to to be strong in that movement not just flexible so i'm bad at that stuff to be honest i can touch my toes but i i'm not putting my palms on the floor at any time yeah and and the argument against that you know you could say well the what's the all cause mortality data and you know exactly that's kind of like i haven't seen it doesn't does show up in the all cause mortality stuff so i'm like all right you know put some time into that but it's not g to be my primary focus but for me it goes to that to quality of life and uh and being highly mobile at any age and never and trying to avoid that aged movement uh pattern that i see chronically in in older adults that haven't trained it so uh right you know and if you you imagine you drop something on the floor and you've got to bend down to pick it up and if it's hard to touch your toes that's going to look like an aged movement pattern i don't want that like you know if i drop so if i'm at if i'm at the grocery store and i'm i'm trying to get like a pepper from the top and it falls on the flooor i can pick it up on from the floor no problem i'm not like oh no i got to bend down and pick it up i'm i'm never worried about that and maybe that seems like an inconsequential thing but again this idea and i keep saying it but age movement pattern i'm trying to avoid that forever indefinitely it's uh yeah keeping it keeping it moving so uh should we skp over to uh anything else that you wanted to say about the exercise stuff we got it okay should we jump over into food then yeah let's do it what do you got so let's see um so i'll i'll i'll start off on this one um so my diet is um uh somewhat less strict uh than yours and thank you for that by the way because uh my friends all think that i'm you know really uh very precise in what i eat and i'm like yeah you think that but boy this guy dr loose garden writes down every gram he eats every single day um so uh for the food things as well i think it comes down to some fundamental categories of food and the interesting thing is is i've gone through the all cause mortality studies is that they seem to say that basically it's not about the subcategory so it's not about eating say uh bananas versus kiwis versus oranges it's about how much fruit you're eating it's not about eating uh green salad versus potatoes it's about how much vegetables you're eating and so it seems that um and and people spend a huge amount of time trying to figure oh my god i need a different colors antioxidants or something this kind of thing but as i look across the studies they say that basically they're all the same thing and those seem to be the same bucket right so if you're if you've eaten say uh three servings of um potatoes poor maligned white potatoes that you're not going to get additional benefit from say eating some cucumber and some lettuce after that like you've already hit your allotment of what you could get as the benefit from the fruits and so for each of the foods there seems to be a very clear benefit from it or or disadvantage for the things that are bad for you they're sometimes bad for you throughout the entire range but my favorite example is nuts um and uh there have been several studies that have shown that a very small portion of nuts like less than an ounce like if we're talking a very small handful daily is one of the greatest reductions in premature death that you can do it's a 17 or so percent reduction in all cause mortality and the funny thing about it is that that's just for that first half handful and then after that there's no additional benefit so if you like nuts go ahead and keep on eating them there's no harm to it but you're not getting any further reductions in all cause mortality and for each of the components say nuts uh beans or legumes fruits vegetables red meat processed meat all those things there's very distinct curves that say this is how much you should get and this is the benefits you'll get and then after this well if you like it sure it's fine but you're getting no more benefit from it so my diet is basically to get beyond just the alternative health eating index i really rigorously go through and try to follow those basic guidelines but to be honest there's a lot of room in there i don't um i haven't been able to find studies that show the benefit of say eating more than even one serving of fruits and one serving of vegetables having that much of an impact on all cause mortality and that's one of the places where we differ i know that you're looking at the biomarkers and you're saying well yeah but my biomarker um it's got a different benefit but when you're just going sort of like where the all cause mortality comes i have a healthy breakfast very healthy breakfast i get about two or three whole grain servings oatmeal um wheat berries kind of things um i have some salad beans in that as well and then some hummus and some veggies and some some fruit and of course a a small handful of nuts and that covers a lot of what i need for the day if i have a salad later on in the day for some more vegetables and things and some fish for dinner which is another very healthy food it's going to cover most what i need and then after that i'm i'm uh your cheat days are kind of a normal day for me i i'll have a croissant or something uh um almost any day um i think that sugar is overly vilified in uh the culture these days it seems to like the great evil um but i that's sort of how i run it as far as the component style of it but feel free to tell me what the biomarkers say about that before going to the biomarkers the biggest the biggest uh uh uh the the i don't want to say the lowest hanging fruit could be total calories what dietary approach can lead you to uh uh being able to take in an amount of calories that allows you to be your leanest assuming that you're leanest is going to reflect uh uh end up reflecting uh your most youthful biomarker profile for example in my data blood pressure which is a potentially a big one for like dementia risk and it de you know systolic blood pressure increases during aging thereby potentially increasing dementia risk um in my data body weight which is largely driven by a modest calorie restriction over time as i haven't increased the exercise duration frequency or intensity um body weight is at the one of the most significantly correlated with blood pressure in my data now knowing that calories are driving that which that again goes back to what dietary approach can lead one to their you know their the the calorie intake that allows them to be the leanest now is it going to be a junk food diet is it the mike cheek day as the chris's chris's every day normal day it's a tuesday yeah if i did that every day i'd be overeating you know and i don't mean overeating by a couple hundred calories a day i mean you know 4,000 7,000 whatever i i can't that's why i have to cut those cheat days to and a very infrequent thing because beyond that it's it it encourages in my brain you know uh bad behavior so uh some people you know now this this is where another one goes beyond the published studies you know i'm not a dietary ideologist meaning you know vegan versus vegetarian versus even carnivore which there's very little published data on all cause mortality risk because and again i'm not trying to pro promote any one diet right so which diet can lead you to to your most satiated where you can have some amount of calorie restriction while also maintaining muscle mass uh so that you can optimize and maintain function over time that's i think that may be the biggest thing now how much does diet composition contribute to that formula for longevity i don't know but uh in terms of the published research if we're going to go for the gold standard of longevity and the people that are you know exercise fanatics and again i'm pro exercise i you know like i said pro exercise i'm doing workouts i'm throwing around heavy weights i'm pro exercise i want i don't want anyone to get the idea that i'm anti- exercise by any means but calorie restriction beats uh regular exercise in terms of the lifespan maximum lifespan effect average an in uh uh recreational physical activity or even just uh you know um voluntary wheel running and rats for example just using an animal model extends average lifespan just like in people you know uh elite athletes and i'll put these studies in the in the you know the the video description elite athletes have an increased average life expectancy compared to the you know to the general population but where are the olympic athletes at 115 you know i've said this before where are they right so there's simultaneously something good and bad about excise we want to get them both now going back to the diet that goes that then knowing that calorie restriction without exercise gets this an even greater increase in average lifespan relative to exercise in the animal studies and incre increases maximum lifespan like i said the dietary approach that gets us to being able to and i don't mean a calorie restriction of you know your maintenance is 3,000 per day you're going to eat, 1500 per day nobody's going to be able to sustain that but the published studies shows somewhere around you know 35% at most if you can sustain that and i wouldn't just directly jump to 35% i mean for me it's been a very slow gradual process over time and i'm not trying to look like a stick figure again i'm trying to have someone amount of muscle mass right so but but the calorie the calorie amount may be the biggest factor in in in in longevity right so um all right now that also then gets into the body weight and the bmi component right of the five factors right which okay is it going to be you know some in the cal restriction society think that a bmi even less than 18.5 which by definition is anorexia which is not associated with improved health and longevity some in the cr society think that that's going to be better now show me your biomarkers show me your markers of organ and systemic function not just metabolic health or selected cherick data um so you know the amount of cr that gets you to a bmi that optim comprehensively optimizes the net sum of as many organ systems as possible so then the actual composition that in is inherent within that may vary i mean maybe some people do better on i don't know 60% fat some people do better on 10% fat but again using the biomarkers uh as the driving tool i i hear you on all cause mortality but there's got to be greater specificity right so um i can you know i can i know what works for me based on you know almost 50 blood tests now since 2015 but there is you know i'll give you an example in terms of composition right so i've been eating with the goal of getting sp spermine and ergine i've been eating an average of about 300 grams of mushrooms per day uh for pretty you know maybe about a year or so okay and i've been doing that on like three days a week where it's like you know 7 to 800 grams a day on three days and then basically nothing for the other three days now inherent in that isn't just spermine and ergine which may extend lipan based on the animal studies or uh erganian extended lifespan in flies that aren't mouse data yet but uh besides mushroom mushrooms containing those two metabolites they are also a rich source of niin now knowing that nad and the bioenergetics and obviously mitochondrial function nad being a big component of that as as it's in the tca cycle so if you're nad levels are low you're going to have suboptimal tca cycle function potentially suboptimal mitochondrial function and we all know how mitochondrial function declines during aging probably going to be a bad thing for quality of life average and maximum lifespan so knowing that mushrooms are a great source of nin my nin intake has been two and a half times the rda for a very long time as long as i' i' i've had mushrooms in the diet so i when i measured nad i didn't expect it to be relatively low or quote unquote age in the 20 micromolar range you know 20 to 25 micromolar you know how's that possible my niin intake is you know this much i'm getting it from mushrooms and sardines and you know it's a mix of plant and animal so knowing that nicotinic acid which is also a nas and you know one of the two main nas and isoforms with nicotinamide being the other knowing that nicotinamide supplementation in very low doses increases my nad suggests to me that the niin that i'm getting from mushrooms is not nicotinic acid but potentially nicotinamide now another aspect of this story another aspect of the story is that uh nicomide has been shown to increase homosysteine more than nicotinic acid my homosysteine levels have been pretty close to age expected which for me that's better than that yeah not just that for me that's like an offensive slur hearing the words here is age expected right so so knowing that my mushroom intake has been high to try to get these prolongevity potentially pro- longevity substances while potentially increasing my levels of nicotinamide which may be bad for the homocysteine now i've cut the mushroom intake down by a little bit so this gets to the idea of specificity within the diet now i don't know what the effect does on homoy yet we'll see how that goes for the next test because this is a relatively recent change now conversely because i've cut the mushrooms down a little bit and knowing that b12 is one of the compon that's been shown or it correlates in my data strongly with reducing homosysteine um and i'm just using homosysteine as an example i'm not trying to say this is the biggest you know metabolite measure it's just as an example so folate and b12 combined to convert homoy into methine so knowing that uh i've increased b12 i've been increasing my folate by a small amount just titrating it up and again my folate intake is an average of about a th micrograms per day which again is two and a half times the rda but it may not be enough for whatever reason you know background genetics you know whatever it may be so you know just that specificity of all right i've cut the mushrooms down potentially reducing nicotinamide that should alleviate some of that potential effect of nicotinamide on homosysteine while also increasing my folate even further than a two and a half times the rda to try to bring homoy f further down this is what i mean about the you know biomarker driven approach and really trying to titrate the amounts and just just the just the the last bit i know i can talk but your friend's giving you a hard time about your you know the diet rigidity right y if you're a farmer you want the best crop yield and to have the best crop yield is going to have a specific formula and i'd imagine that every year if you're a new farmer there's probably a learning process where you're learning you know okay what's the soil composition what's my crop yield how much water is there what's the ph of the whole system what are the factors that are really driving my crop yield for us c and everybody the crop yield is longevity right and i've i don't want to say stumbled but i've through trial and error and many testing and rigorous evaluation and interventions and all this stuff the biomarkers are mostly useful right so i know the dietary composition uh you know that uh correlates best with that full profile so for me it's i don't want to mess it up you know i want my best crop yield you know and um so i'm happy to and it's a diet that makes me happy if if i if wasn't satiated and uh you know and comfortable on it it would be hard to maintain forever for example if you said eat ground flax seeds which basically uh look and taste like sawdust every day for the rest of your life that'd be a bit of a challenge right but mix it with stuff and you know uh some days i can eat it by itself you know so um so so so i enjoy it and it's and it's a part of the approach being you know helping me to keep my body body weight relatively lean uh and and being satiated so that's the long story on the diet and you know the rigidity of it and only having occasional cheat meals so so so it's interesting so i like the um so the c it's funny you say that you that you think the diet is the most important but then you point to something that i think is actually i i'm not sure if it's outside or it's different but basically you're saying the overall calorie intake you feel is one of the key drivers definely and i've i've been watching my blood pressure as well and i'm kind like well hm let's see you know 125 over 80 is that great i mean it's probably okay now but as you say that's not a that's not one that goes down as you get older um but my uh my useful sort of handling in the way that i control my weight is not through daily uh measurements but rather through fasting so i follow the 52 system so on my days where i'm eating i just eat whatever i want um basically but two days a week i'm on under 500 calories and that's rigorous and done every week or so i've been doing it for about 10 years now and uh we've had some discussion before about okay well it's not exactly clear in the animal studies where they say calor restriction leads to longer life whether that's actually the calorie restriction or whether it's a very effectively they're getting fasting because they're only being fed during the office hours of the interns who are feeding them um and i think the the jury's still out on that one you pointed out there are some studies that seem to imply the other way um but yeah it's a key thing but like from the all cause mortality studies the weight stuff seems um they're the confounders right so people who are exceptionally thin and are oftentimes really skinny because they're dying right so so it's it's it's hard to to clean the data and get that out and for a while it looked like they were saying that people actually who are kind of middleweight like bmi of 25 seem to live longer even slightly overweight and then they said okay well let's take out the people who are sickly or whatever and other things but um there was much to do about that and when i see kind of that back and forth and kind of like no it's not this way it's this way and both of them are kind of showing it and basically the line's not moving much the conclusion i draw from that is it's not that big of a deal like there's no clear winner on that one right like so so i i can i can add more specificity to that right so yeah there are some published studies showing that a bmi at older ages i think it's in the overweight range 25 to 30 is the lowest risk on that j shape curve right so right so i could actually probably rationalize some some aspect of that immune function declines during aging uh so um fat actually has an antimicrobial component to it so fat actually releases can secrete um cathal aidon which is an antimicrobial protein so i'd imagine that for people who experience an age related i should say for people that experience i mean basically everybody will experience it right at some point the age related immune function decline but right for for that for me it makes sense that okay age related immune uh function decline fat mass is potentially compensatory to help the immune system as another factor of that cholesterol follows the uh you know ldl and total cholesterol follows that same pattern where it increases to about midlife and immune function declines you know similarly up to about well indefinitely but cholesterol also has an immune enhancing process uh properties as it can bind to things like lipopolysaccharide which can leak into the blood during aging so um but then like you mentioned you know then after about 50 to 60 cholesterol declines and now you're on the road to to you know the slow the slow drive to death because you've got the age related uh decline for immune function and then you don't have cholesterol to potentially compensate so an increase in body fatness and i'm not saying that's the way to do it but for people in that category who have an age related immune function decline it may be that fat is acting potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to try to help the immune system uh now now that said what if there was a healthy control group so from youth uh you know stayed lean their whole life you know that i think that's a big you know missing drawback is that the healthy you know lean lean basically since youth control group doesn't exist so you know now it g it going back to specific so uh one can do the experiment to see just even at the individual level if your bmi is 28 and you lose weight over some period of time and for me i think doing slower is better that's going to be the safest way you're going to be able to maintain those habits for a long time if you've done it slow and steady versus you lose it all in two months and then you what's gna happen have you learned any habits or you just you just starved yourself eating and then you're going to eventually need e again kind of thing yeah yeah so if you looked at the full panel of biomarkers blood pressure all of the the full list kidney liver immune red blood cells inflammation metabolic health etc if you took that same person at a bmi of 28 uh even a fit 8 28 right uh fit bmi of 28 relatively fit with some amount of body fat because i can't imagine unless you're a bodybuilder on some amount of steroids to have a bmi of 28 it's going to be very hard to be natural i don't know people are g to come at me now i'm 5 foot7 215 and my body fat is 5% i'm not talking about people like that most people that have a bmi of 28 even with a fitness lifestyle probably gna have some amount of body fat maybe 15 20% for a man okay regardless now if you cut your body weight over time now get your bmi to i don't know 23 24 and look at your biomarkers i bet at least seeing my own data i'm gonna put this in a video at some point um i mean body weight is behind almost everything i mean it's wow yeah it so so uh but again does that mean eat garbage you know you know some some professional athletes you know they're notorious candy eaters and they're lean and fit you know but then they maybe have short careers right so um it's calor restriction with optimal nutrition that's the goal but then the question is what's the optimal nutrition how do you define that which then goes to the biomarkers now going going to the fasting this is a big one right so going to the publish studies i'm pretty sure there's no trifect of this combination um fasting calorie restriction and circadian alignment in people i don't i'm pretty sure that data on all cause mortality doesn't exist yet but um there's a study and i have a video on this where like you said the c restricted animals they eat all of their food within a very short window and then they're basically fasted for the rest of the day and then if they were calorie restricted on that most of the day fasting approach and ate most ate their food for mice they are no nocturnal which means they should be eating at night not during the day which is when lab studies have basically bent their physiology to accommodate us right we're going to put the mice on keep them awake during the day keep them awake at the day and let them sleep at night but they actually evolve the opposite of that so when you allow that trifecta let them eat at night as they evolve to do um uh fasted about 35% uh cal restriction and fasted they had they had about a 35% uh extension of lifespan the longest lifespan rel relative to um not circadian alli and not fasting so that could be a potentially big part of this too i incorporate the fasting every day i try to have that eating window less than eight hours on three days a week it's almost all of my calories maybe 90% is an hour and a half in the morning and then just the remaining 10% in the afternoon um so the vast majority of it is in a very short window so i do try to incorporate that now in terms of biomarkers i don't see a difference with that approach versus the way it used to be where i' basically eat you know do one meal a day you know 4: in the afternoon until 6 and then you know um and so basically i i don't see any difference in the biomarkers there in terms of sleep quality it's immeasurably better uh you know trying to get that eating window and finishing it earlier in the day and that's the main reason why i do it is it improves sleep quality for me um less nighttime awakenings like if i'm needing a giant you know vegetable f filled meal at at 6:00 i'm up at 10 12 two i mean i'm up every two hours using the bathroom which is terrible so right yeah that's that's interesting that you didn't actually find a much of a difference based off the time of day or even the restriction is from the biomarker point of view um but i should i should say though that i've been before every blood test i do about a 17h hour fast and i don't know why i settled on that it's just for the early uh blood test you know uh i noted that it was okay it was 17 hours since i ate so i basically stay stayed consistent with that so it could be that for the earlier test in 2015 even with the the later eating style and not all of my calories earlier in the day it could be that for whatever reason before the test it could be that maybe one day of a you know 17h hour window which is longer than the standard you know 8 to 12 hour window fasting maybe that had some impact on standardizing the blood test data i don't know i doubt that that's the case but i don't i don't see gross differences you know well it's um it's interesting that you point out that that shift i mean a lot of people when they get into the tim restricted feeding the first thing they do is skip breakfast and it's um one of those yeah um they say i should eat breakfast but i don't and it's easier and it's so great and uh the studies on that are bad um they had a study where they actually looked at the uh the effects of skipping breakfast versus not and they found first of all the your metabolism slows down by about 50 calories a day secondly the people who were skipping breakfast reported more hunger throughout the day so they were more unhappy and thirdly they reported them as wanting to eat junkier foods like they wanted to eat more kind of chips and sort of things that you'd like to stay away from more um so that's one of the the sort of pitfalls of it and in the short term if you've gotten used to eating three meals a day and then you start skipping breakfast yes you'll lose some weight but they find that to be short term uh and if you look at people who are have been skipping breakfast over a longer period of time they're heavier they generally tend to be more overweight so it's uh impressive that you've shifted from like sort of the evening to the breakfast time and waiting it heavy there and that's probably one of the reasons why you've been able to keep this up for so long yeah well it was an easy change because uh sleep quality has always been an issue right so um like i did uh one of my next videos coming probably wednesday next wednesday is on uh slow wave sleep right so deep sleep uh thought to be restorative sleep um so i did a sleep study probably 10 years ago and uh and i was getting terrible sleep back then and uh my slow wave sleep was 5% of the total now to put that into perspective it slow wave sleep percentage declined declines during aging and for a 90-year-old the average is 8% of total sleep time so under the best conditions i got 5% of my total sleep as slow wave sleep which is terrible now i'm pretty close to 25% so wow and and what correlates with that too is body weight which is crazy so uh one component there are others you know so but uh so the change the shift from you know one meal a day eating later in the day to getting it earlier in the day once i saw that um i was waking up less i was feeling a bit better not perfectly better but still i saw improvements in my you know uh how do i feel and do i feel more well rested so that it was an easy shift and plus with the inperson work schedule you know i don't like to eat at work like so just just but and the other interesting thing about this too is that so calor restricted mice as you mentioned they eat the majority of their food within like uh you know a couple hours or within a few hour window and then they're fast the whole day but they know the next day when their food should be there and they're waiting and eager to eat their food when i wake up it's used the bath it's goes straight to eat i'm eating for like an hour and a half it's an inperson work day and i look forward to it right so uh yeah and and it's vegetables and fruit that takes so long to eat oh my gosh yeah that's true well you know for people who don't know i'm not vegan i have i've actually had like five eggs a week now for i've incorporated that and i eat dairy every day and sardines every day so i'm not i'm not far from vegan right but when you say all the yeah i get i get l lacto oval uh i guessan yeah but i'm open to meat right it's just uh it doesn't satiate me as much as the other animal products and it doesn't impact the biomarkers too as as as much so huh so do you see that when you take uh well you don't have any red meat in your your uh routine u one of the things that i um your routine is very well focused um and i was trying to tell you you should like mess around a lot more to get more data on it but i know you're like no i got the ship as steered i don't need to like yank the rudder i'm like but there's science we would find there come on yeah so so gfinity suggest so that's i mentioned that that's going to be one of not along along the diet lines but so you know that 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid uh we saw my ned go up to like 3x higher 67 micromolar uh but then my doneen pace was 0.98 which i've had nothing even close to that forever like nine tests so when i suggested that it could be nad to high he was like no it's probably anin pro or nicotinic acid your nicotinic acid was too high right so when he suggested all right let's let's raise your ned with nmn which is also nicotinamide uh in the nin family um this is almost like for the sake of science for me it's like okay 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid i got 38 micromolar let's see what it does to den and pace um and let's see what it does to the the b markers for me story closed but to have to prove the point uh i'm not and no disrespect to j infinity i'm big fan you know but you know the creative you know the creative process is being disturbed to prove a point you know uh so yeah getting me to tweak around with uh you know add more this add more that it's got to be d so my uh my uh most recent i'm not sure if i've mentioned this yet um uh perturbation of my schedule for the science and to see what it does to me uh so i've registered for a marathon um which is uh well over the uh 15 minutes of running a week so i've just started a 16-week plan actually to uh get ready for it and uh i'm i'm quite nervous about it um i think my v2 max is quite good i've had it measured uh it was about 55 which is outstanding um with the full mask on and plotting on a treadmill and every 30 seconds they goose the speed to see if you can keep up with it um but a real marathon's a real marathon so we'll see um i got myself some jumpy shoes so that raises the question right so with marathon training that's gonna most likely be a volume increase right a training volume increase over what you're doing now so with that in mind um you know you should get some v2 max increase whether it's going from 55 to 60 and you should mention that it's not a predicted 55 like fitness tracker predicted 55 this is the mask this was a like a you know official thing right so yeah you're probably yes so you're probably gonna get some v2 max boost right 55 to 60 i don't know somewhere it should be somewhere higher i i hard to believe in increase in training volume you're going to stay the same at what your v2 max was before now with that in mind with that increase in training volume will your and improvement of v2 max will your heart rate variability go down resting heart rate go up chronically for that increase in training volume time now so now it raises the interesting question which i get i've gotten criticism from endurance athletes because you know they'll say well it's vo2 max that's the most that's the most important who cares about your heart rate variability your resting heart rate being a bit worse uh doesn't matter i don't care about those metrics i care about the functional measures so what do you think about the the dichotomy of you know having your your v2 max be the highest but you may take a hit on your actual metrics of uh you know cardiovascular fitness uh and and health right so yeah it's um i'll find out some of that experientially um i've just um i just started now because of this i'm i'm like fully you know censored up now i've got my whoop i've got an aura ring that i just bought this last week and i've got my apple watch and so now i can have like votes right like what was the most important thing what's your actual heart rate um and it's it's a little bit of experience getting used to it i'm thinking about writing a review or something on it maybe we can have that one of our discussions later cool um but it's uh i the v2 max has they have the studies for the acm and they i uh all cause mortality i think i've seen it also for the heart rate the resting heart rate as well right that's another one where it's sort of a known thing and i have to look into it but i'm i'm not sure i i don't i don't have an answer on that one yet so so uh like maybe in the short term on your most recovered day right so say you're doing a few days of training you know high volume training for your marathon and then you have like a recovery day right so i'd imagine that after your recovery day if your best resting heart rate was i think you showed me was like 41 the other day right if your best is 41 and then uh you're doing the marathon training and then your best after recovery day is 44 right so now you're getting a potential in this goes to that idea of exercise dose right this is how i see it you know sure you may be getting some incremental increase in v2 max but if that's at the detriment of you know so if your wrting heart rate is is going up and your heart rate variability going is going down that's a basically a sign that you're you're stressing your body to the point where your auton your your autonomic and your parasympathetic nervous system are somewhat out of whack now what will how will that translate into disease risk and longevity i don't know but i'd imagine your your your metrics of you know you i think you'd want the highest v2 max with the you know the highest heart rate variability and lowest resting heart rate you know does that mean training for a marathon will get you there i don't know does that mean training two hours a day uh two miles a day walking running whatever i don't know it's individual right but this is this is one of those places where you and i differ for i think that uh i am in the punch it and uh improve it over the long run whereas you're like no i'm watching it every day my resting heart rate if i do this i know that the next day my resting heart rate for you know it'll be high for a few days so that day when i had um a triple digit heart rate variability 103 and a resting heart rate of 41 that was the day after i ran hit like i had run like 25 minutes a hit the day before um and it was a good run i had new shoes and i was super happy because i've got my marathon shoes that are really bouncy um but uh i don't know we'll it uh it will be interesting to see so uh maybe we'll have a discussion about that in a later podcast wait wait for sure for sure but wait what was the then what happened the day after that because it went far away from 103 to 41 right so um a full switch around and i'm not actually sure like i haven't i don't i haven't worn it long enough to kind of know my whooop to know what's causing that flip around but the aura ring agreed on the second day so the day after that then my heart rate went up to 51 and uh actually my my heart rate variability went down to from 103 down to 37 in one day it's like i'm a different person but so that you asked me what i did i mean it was kind of a normal day i went to the gym i did my my half hour workout i did um some heavy squats uh three sets of eight reps of 110 kgrs those are big um but that's not not big for me that's a normal kind of my routine um but i had about seven drinks that night and that was between like six and 11 o'clock at night so it's probably some dehydration um alcohol alcohol is a known murder of heart rate variability resing heart that's the whole that that drove the whole ship like you can't go from average you can't have an average uh i don't remember what it was like 40 for heart rate variability and 50 for resting heart rate if that your average to then see 140 to go to elite endurance athlete it no like maybe if if your averages was 40 50 uh maybe at your best you'd see like 50 46 something like that so so so all right so then that also raises the question knowing that was that your best data that you've seen so far 100 to 40 well i mean in like the two weeks i've had it but yes so with that in mind then it gets to okay what how many drinks can you tolerate where instead of your average i think i saw your average was like 60 something in in the 40s for resting heart rate over the one week average right so so what amount of alcoh because alcohol is murder like i said of of those data what amount of alcohol is it two drinks is it one drink is it three drinks where you're not crushing yourself physiologically i mean you know the the the physical enjoyment of that many drinks for sure but the physiological detriment right so how many drinks can you you can actually titrate the dose where you're not over stressing yourself right so that you can always almost always see that 100 because your your metric should be better than mine chronically i shouldn't with my exercise duration and how many steps you're taking i shouldn't i shouldn't have but granted the good news is at my best i'm not too far away from where you were right so but with some tit trading and some tweaking your your data will chronically be 100 over 40 which is amazing is as youthful as you can pretty much get but that day for example you say tie trading so i can already tell you on that day i had a beer that evening right that was my fasting day my day where i did the high-intensity interval training and then had a a one can of beer before at about 6 or actually no about 8 o'clock before i went to bed so somewhere between 1 and 7 there seems to be a a steep j curve in there we'll see i'm not uh and also i was staying in uh i was traveling at the time so i was staying in an uncomfortable unfamiliar area bed so that might have also had some effect on it but it's good to have the data now i just need some more data so i can figure out what the keys are so one weakness of whoop is uh i'd recommend tracking it in a spreadsheet because they i think they provide data like you know year to year like your here's your year yearly data and you can visually see it but if you actually wanted to track your own data over time i mean sure you could go back and look at it but to look at correlations uh i don't know maybe you could use their journal but if you're not manually recording it you won't be able to go back in time like do there's no export on it i don't i don't think so and and so for example the uh respiratory rate the nighttime respiratory rate which is on there um so i only have like i don't know three years of data but i've been wearing it for five years it doesn't go back all the way um and there may even be a shorter window than that where it it you know i wasn't recording it manually and it's not available on their website right so uh i'd record it in case it disappears you know so okay right if you want to calculate correlations which i i think would be super interesting you know want to see i want to see yeah i look to see the history too so okay how many drinks how many drinks is it where it doesn't affect your data right it's just one clear do i wonder what it would be like no alcohol at all if i mean granted one beer could have no impact one beer could have some moderate impact but if there was you know is your best truly 103 over 41 or is it 115 over 30 38 i i don't know right so but that's that's where i pull back from the the biomarkers as the final arbiter right i'm kind of like you know what i'm having beers like uh i mean it's funny right i mean if you look at those numbers you'd say it was a different person right like i should have been laid out like i should have been you know lying on my couch the whole day but okay i'm i'm maybe a little tired or so but i didn't if id had a workout today i'd have done the workout just as i normally do so i don't i don't adjust based off of what you know this readiness thing i'm kind of like oh that's interesting but uh if i have a workout scheduled i'm doing the workout you have the lucky genetic lottery physiology because i can tell the difference between my data did that oh gez like and it maybe it's placebo maybe it's a real effect but for whatever reason you know i wouldn't say minor deviations affect me but you know knowing that my average is right now probably uh 68 42 if it's like uh 50 50 something and 45 46 i feel that i i know really oh yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah cognitively uh physically even my workout so for example yesterday it was i don't know you saw it was like 80 8139 and that's a great thing because i'm always aiming for that on the morning of a workout the workout you know the the the the struggle during a workout which should be a struggle and a challenge is always harder if my data is worse my metrics are worse on that morning versus if they're almost completely fully recovered so for me there's something to it you know but if i saw my data cut in half like yours geez oh i'd be on the couch like leave me alone don't talk to me like yeah so just went up and went on my day i'm like oh that's weird wish i had fantastic good news for you so far yeah okay so we covered a lot we could probably go on forever but uh we'll save it for uh for the next time sounds good okay great talking to you ciao right thanks
