# Albumin: What's Optimal For Youth And Health? (2022 Update)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

If the goal is to optimize biological age optimizing albumin is a good start and that's because albumin is included in at least two blood-based biological age calculators including levine's biological age calculator as shown there and also in aging.ai as shown there now the reference range for albumin is 3.4 to 5.4 grams per deciliter or 34 to 54 grams per liter but the reference range doesn't indicate whether higher or lower levels of albumin are optimal in terms of youth or health so that'll be the focus of this video and also can albumen be improved so first how does albumin change during aging so this is a study of about 1.1 million people and we're looking at serum levels of albumin on the y-axis plotted against age all the way up to 100 years old and we can see that albumin levels decline during aging for both men and women so how does albumin relate to risk of death for all costs and that's what we can see here so the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of albumin on the x so first lowest all-cause mortality risk was present for an albumin concentration of 46 grams per liter but there is a range for the lowest risk so starting with 45 which was defined as the reference so that's a hazard ratio of 1.0 then we can see 446 the hazard ratio was 0.97 so a 3 reduced risk and that's significant because we can see the data in parentheses the 95 confidence interval was both was completely below one so it's a significant uh association and then there wasn't data for 47 for albumin but there was data for 48 in this paper and uh the we can see the hazard ratio is 1.02 but the confidence interval overlaps with one so that indicates that having an albumin of 48 is not significantly different from 45 so that leads to the range for lowest risk being 45 to 48 grams per liter for albumin so if you remember the data from the previous slide youthful levels of albumin are equal to the lowest all-cause mortality risk so us looking at the age-related data we can see that peak values for women and men are 45 and 46 respectively which fall into that range for lowest risk for all-cause mortality 45 to 48. Now note that there is significantly increased risk when abdomen is less than 45 but also when abdomen is greater than 49 so first starting with the data for 49 we can see that that hazard ratio is 1.07 so a seven percent increased risk for all cause mortality and we can see that the that the data in parentheses uh does not overlap with one so it's a significant association and similarly for an abbeymen of 51 we can see a 15 increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering these data we can see based on the aging and all-cause mortality data that optimal abdomen is 45 to 48 grams per liter or 4.5 to 4.8 grams per deciliter all right so can the age-related decline for albion be slowed or stopped so let's have a look at my own n of one data so i have 43 blood tests for abdomen since 2005. Now when i first started tracking uh blood biomarkers i wasn't tracking diet so from 2005 to 2013 i was just going to the doctor about once a year and recording that data in an excel spreadsheet and that's what we can see here and my average over those seven blood tests over that nine year period uh level of albumin was 4.74 grams per deciliter now in 2015 i had the idea to start diet tracking so let's just take a quick look at that for people who haven't seen that approach who may be new to the channel so uh i've been weighing literally all of my food uh since april of 2015 using a food scale and then i entered those food amounts into chronometer and i'm not here to say if chronometer is the best or not this is just what i've used every day since 2015. There may be other apps that do a similar thing you know quantifying food composition but that's what i use and if you're interested in a chronometer membership discount that will be in the video's description now i then take chronometers data data and enter it into a spreadsheet and because i'm also tracking blood biomarkers at the same time i can calculate correlations between diet with the blood biomarkers so now back to the data and i i started blood testing way more often in 2015 and my first blood test for albumin actually started in 2016. So over that uh seven year period 2015 to 2022 my average albumin level is 4.94 grams per deciliter and 36 blood tests over that seven years span now when using a two sample t-test we can see that these two groups of data are significantly different so when compared with 2005 to 2013 i've been able to resist the age-related decline for albumin and have significantly increased it instead now if you remember from the previous slide optimal albumin is 45 to 48 grams per liter or 4.5 to 4.8 grams per deciliter so uh this would put my current average of albumin at 4.94 at a seven percent increased all-cause mortality risk so if relatively high albumin is bad for health i'd expect a net negative correlative score for albumin with big picture biomarkers so let's take a look at a biomarker versus biomarker analysis albumin versus other big picture biomarkers and that's what we can see here and without going too much into the what are the big picture biomarkers as i've presented that in many other videos this is 23 biomarkers that are representative of many different organ systems so how does albumin compare for its correlation with these biomarkers so what we can see is that no blood biomarkers are significantly correlated with albumin uh the only one that's even close is glucose with that p-value of 0.06 and a positive correlation so in other words relatively higher albumin is significantly is close to being significantly correlated with a higher glucose but if the p-value is just outside statistical significance so while the all-cause mortality data suggests that 4.9 may be sub-optimal for albumin there's no evidence in my data that 4.9 is too high now that being said on my latest test which was in may uh you know to about two months ago may of 2022 abby moon is 4.8 grams per deciliter so going forward i'm going to try my best to limit some of the the values that are higher than 5. You can see i've got a few values at 5 5.2 even 5.4 so i'm going to try to limit those to try to stay closer to 4.8 and flat line my abdomen uh so that it's right at that threshold for the optimal range 45 to 48 or 4.5 to 4.8 so i noted that i've been able to resist the age-related decline for abdomen so how have i been able to do that so as i mentioned i have 36 blood tester albumin since 2015 that correspond to diet so i can then look at correlations for macro and micronutrients with almond with the goal of optimizing albumin so we can see that data here so starting with macronutrients and note that i've got oxalate listed as a macronutrient it's not a vitamin or a mineral so there's no other place to put it so i put it within the macronutrients even though it's not a macronutrient nonetheless we can see that none of these macronutrients are significantly correlated with albumin similarly most of the vitamins are not significantly correlated with albumin and none of the vitamins uh are significantly correlated with albumin now the only two that are significantly correlated with albumin are vitamin a and beta-carotene now note that almost exclusively all of my vitamin a intake comes from carotenoids including beta-carotene so that significant correlation for vitamin a with albumin is likely driven only by beta-carotene so beta-carotene from what and this is a screenshot of chronometer data this is uh literally seven years this is my average intake for the past seven years and again this is a screenshot of chronometer data and we can see that my average beta daily beta carotene intake is about 55 000 micrograms or 55 milligrams per day and i get it completely from whole food this isn't from supplements so a couple quick things to note here carrots are listed there twice and so is lettuce and that's because unbeknownst to me at some point in the past i was entering raw carrots for example using two different databases that are in chronometer one of them being the canadian database and the other being the us so i did that unknowingly for both carrots and lettuce nonetheless we can see that the majority of my beta-carotene intake comes from carrots but also butternut squash spinach both raw and cooked which i've since cut down to limit oxalates uh uh sweet potato orange sweet potato red bell pepper uh lettuce and broccoli so when considering beta carotene significant correlation with albumin how much beta-carotene is optimal to keep albumin in that 45-48 or 4.5 to 4.8 gram per deciliter range so let's take a visual look at albumin versus beta carotene which is what we can see here so my uh and we've got the correlation that i just put up on the screen so my lowest intake for beta carotene has been around 33 000 micrograms per day or around 33 milligrams per day and my highest beta-carotene intake and note that each of these dots corresponds to the average intake average daily intake that corresponds to a blood test so my highest beta carotene intake has been about 67 micrograms per day as shown there with the average as i noted on the previous slide of about 55 000 micrograms per day or 55 milligrams per day so if beta-carotene intake causes higher albumin and note that i'm not trying to say that correlation equals causation i know that these are correlations i don't know if this is causation but if beta-carotene is indeed causative for higher albumin levels in my data i can't say that this will be true for everybody else or anybody else should i eat as much beta-carotene as possible with the goal of optimizing albumin so superficially the answer would be yes if the goal is only to optimize albumin that would be the answer but will maximizing beta-carotene intake optimize albumin but make other biomarkers worse i don't want to make one thing good and mess up three other things but alternatively maybe a higher beta-carotene intake will optimize more things then it'll mess up so how can we assess that so let's take a look at correlations for beta-carotene with big picture biomarkers and again this is my own individual data n of one data so we can see that here correlate correlations for beta-carotene with big picture biomarkers uh and just real quick the little n is how many blood tests that i have for each of these biomarkers the little r is the correlation and the p value is whether it's a significant correlation or not so first we can see that uh significant correlation for beta carotene with albumin so a relatively higher beta carotene intake is smoothly correlated with higher albumin but then note that a relatively higher beta-carotene intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose higher blood urea nitrogen bun higher alkaline phosphatase higher ldl higher neutrophils and monocytes and a lower lymphocyte percentage now in terms of how these uh correlations look in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk these are all going in the wrong direction for example we don't want higher glucose or higher blood higher blood urea nitrogen those are going in the wrong direction in terms of in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk so when considering correlations for beta-carotene with big picture biomarkers i've got one going in the right direction albumin and seven going in the wrong direction to lead to a net correlative score of -6 now that suggests that i should not eat as much beta-carotene as possible as it may optimize albumin but make a lot of other stuff worse so with that in mind my current beta-carotene intake that's corresponding to my next blood test which will be in a few weeks is uh 50 000 micrograms per day or sorry yeah or 50 milligrams per day now note that that's purposely purposely below my average intake of about 55 000 micrograms per day as when i have a net negative correlative score i aim for less than my average intake all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging
