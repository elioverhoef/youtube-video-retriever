Who has the slowest epigenetic pace of aging we can see that data here this is the top 15 for the rejuvenation olympics and if you notice i'm not on the list so with that in mind what's my data so i have 12 tests currently for done and pace and to get on this test to get on the leaderboard you need an average of three done and pace measurements over 6 months so my last test was in january of 2024 6 months prior would be june of 2023 now i don't have three tests over that time span i have six tests so i don't know how they'll rank that but i think what makes the most sense is taking the average over that 6-month period which in my case is 0.81 0.81 would put me at 14th place which isn't bad but the goal is obviously to move up now there is hope for optimism as two of those six tests two of the most recent six tests were relatively lower 75 and 74 which would put me into a tie for eighth place so in order to more consistently see my best data i need to know which factors are significantly correlated with the and pace so let's start off with correlations for diet with the and pace and for those who are unfamiliar with the approach since 2015 i weighed all my food using a food scale i then entered those daily food amounts into chronometer and if you want to track your own diet there's a discount link for chronometer in the video's description and then i manually log that data into a spreadsheet so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words for a given 60-day period in between blood tests because i'm tracking diet every day i can take the 60-day average which then lines up with the latter blood test so every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake and then with many blood tests and many dietary intakes that correspond i can calculate correlations and after calculating correlations with the goal of improving uh biomarkers i i follow or i try to follow as many of the significant correlations as possible with a p val uh p value less than 0.05 being the measure of statistical significance all right so with that in mind i then looked at 97 comparisons for den and past with foods macro and micronutrients and this is a 12 test analysis and we can see the d that data for what data is closest to the being significantly associated with daita pace here so on the left we've got the food or nutrient and in the middle we've got the correlation and then on the right we've got the p value and notice though that there are no foods or nutrients that are significantly correlated at a p value less than 0.05 with ded and pace as the best hit the best correlation is vitamin b6 with a p value of 0.1 which is outside of significance so at this point i have two options one just keep testing and gather more data and i'm going to do that anyway so that's not really an option or two i decided to take a deeper dive and this isn't the first time i've done this this i've done biomarker versus biomarker analyses before but in order to get potentially gain more insight into mechanisms that may impact don need and pace i then decided to look at correlations for d and pace with other biomarkers and we can see that full list here correlations for d and pace with other biomarkers more specifically 23 biomarkers that i commonly track as shown here with the full list on the left and then i on the same day as done and pay testing i also measured other bio biomarkers versus ven venopuncture so going to the lab and having them pull it pull it out of my vein and then when i got home i did the uh blood test finger prick for done and pace so i have 9 to 11 tests that correspond for standard blood biomarkers on the same day of testing as d and pace almost all of the tests as you can see with the n which is the number of samples almost all of them are 11 so 11 tests that match up with the kn and pace with the exception of dhea sulfate which i currently have nine data points that overlap and then aging a where i have 10 but aging. A has been unfortunately discontinued so that'll always be 10 unless that's uh restored and then again in the middle we've got the correlation and then the p value so now we've got four of these biomarkers that are significantly correlated with don and pace the liver enzymes a plus alt platelets but then where the story starts to get interesting at least for me is dhea sulfate which is significantly inversely correlated with don and paast in other words a relatively higher d dhe sulfate in my data is significally correlated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging and why that's interesting is because my dhea sulfate is currently one of the weaknesses in my data it's close to age expected and not youthful i've had values that are um about 2 and a half times higher in my early 30s and i just didn't track it for a very long time and they declined over the past uh 15 years or so so getting them back to you for levels without supplementation is a part of the one of the current goals but then where the story gets most interesting at least for me is ldl and there too is a significant inverse correlation so let's take a deeper look at that correlation so it's 11 tests for don and pace versus ldl and then we can see with donita pace on the y- axis plotted against the ldl concentration on the x we can see that significant inverse correlation for ldl against d pace in other words relatively higher ldl in my data is significantly correlated with a slower epen pace of aging conversely lower ldl is significant correlated with a faster epigenetic pace of aging but note that these data just to highlight the range in my case at this current uh point in time is from 62 to 83 mig per deciliter i i'm not trying to make any extrapolations for people who have ldl far higher that's a story for a different day now also note that for one of these tests highd do nicotinic acid uh on this on the where i had a 0.98 which which is my worst donan pace yet to date ldl on that date was 65 now in earlier videos i've hypothesized that highd dose nasin 600 milligrams per day may raise ned too high and that may have been what messed up don pce sending it to my worst value to date but these data would suggest that maybe going uh maybe highd do nasin nicotinic acid reduces ldl to a level where it may be too low negatively impacting epigenetic pace of aging so note that there are only two data points on the far left side of 65 mg per decer so there is some extrapolation on this graph so instead of testing that hypothesis by reducing my ldl as low as it can go and seeing if my the need and pace gets even worse conversely i think testing the other side of that curve or the other side of that that uh slope in other words if i increase ldl will i see my best dne and pace i think that makes more sense sense but what about coronary heart disease risk right if we increase ldl wouldn't that increase heart disease risk so let's take a look at what the data has to show so on the y-axis we've got the hazard ratio for coronary heart disease chd mortality plotted against serum levels of ldl and there are two main reasons why i like this study first it has a very large sample size this is about 4.5 million people that were included in this study and then second is that there are three curves and as we'll see the fully adjusted model included almost every comorbidity that could potentially impact the association for ldl with heart disease risk and unfortunately most studies at least the ones that i've come across don't adjust for all comorbidities that can impact that association so it's somewhat part of the picture not the full picture whereas i think this study is closer to the full picture and for those who who disagree please leave a comment we can debate that there so in terms of what's significant we put up our red line at a hazard ratio of one remember where the shaded region for any of these three colored lines is completely above one or completely above below one we have a significant association so for the first model model one this is the minimally adjusted model in blue they adjusted for age sex race and smoking status and just using an ldl of 120 as an example that was significantly associated with a about a 20% reduced heart disease mortality risk but then when including stattin use bmi hypertension and diabetes into the model that same 120 for ldl was now only associated with a 10% reduced risk of heart disease mortality risk what about the fully adjusted model so that's shown in green and as i mentioned they adjusted for basically every comorbidity that you can think of in addition to removing data for a 2-year lag so people who died within the first two years was removed so basically these are very sick people who died within 2 years they didn't want that to skew their results and then they also adjusted for hdl pre-existing coronary artery artery disease atrial fibrillation pre-existing heart failure stroke anemia liver disease kidney disease lung disease cancer depression and dementia in other words almost every comorbidity that can impact the association for ldl with heart disease mortality risk and when looking at the data for model 3 now we can see that an ldl of 120 is not significantly associated with a reduced risk for heart disease mortality in contrast when ldl is greater than 120 that's associated with a significantly increased heart disease mortality risk but that's only half the story the other half of that story is when ldl was less than 65 mig per deciliter that too was associated with an increased heart disease mortality risk now if you remember the data on the right hyos nasin reduced my ldl to 65 mgs per deciliter which is right on that edge of an increased heart disease mortality risk so is it possible that in my case for whatever reason reon going too low for ldl may not be good for epigenetic uh the epigenetic pace of aging but also potentially bad for heart disease mortality risk at least based on what this published data shows so with that in mind there is a relatively safe range based on this plot for 65 to 120 for ldl being associated with lowest risk for heart disease mortality so i do have room for improvement in my ldl current ldl data to go a bit higher and to do it safely so that in mind that's the goal for the next test to raise ldl to greater than 85 mig per deciliter i'm not talking about anything outrageous like 170 even just a small increase to 90 to 95 to do that i've increased total fat intake which is significantly correlated with ldl in my data those correlations are in the correlation tier on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out but even within total fat where do you go from there so subdividing that saturated fat as expected that's significant correlated with ldl in my data but that doesn't tell you from what also coconut butter is significantly correlated which is the major source of my saturated fat intake so for the next test i've increased coconut butter intake for the past week or so so i'll have about two plus weeks of data with a relatively higher saturated fatty acid content from coconut butter and we'll see if i can push my ldl just a bit higher to test this correlation with the need and pace will it work test number two in 2024 is scheduled for march 4th so that up video will be coming sometime in april all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole
