# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #5 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A couple of weeks ago i blood tested for the fifth time in 2022 so with that in mind what's my biological age so we can see that data here this is using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and note that if you have data for these nine biomarkers you can calculate your own biological age using levine's test and that link will be in the video's description so when entering the data for these nine component biomarkers i get a biological age of 34.0 years which is 15.6 years younger than my chronological now note that my biological age could be a little bit less uh that's because quest indicated that my high sensitivity c-reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so it could be less than that as you saw in an earlier video but it can't be more than 0.3 milligrams per liter at least for this test and besides me entering data into this excel spreadsheet if you're interested in looking and seeing screenshots of my blood test data all of that will be included at the end of the video all right so this is just one blood test for more context let's have a look at biological age results using levene's test since 2018 and i have 20 blood tests over that time period that's shown here so we've got levine's biological age on the y axis plotted against time on the x so from 2018 to 2019 i tested three times and over those three tests my average levine biological age score was 36.1 years and then with six blood tests in 2020 and six in 2021 an average of 35.6 years in each of those two years all right so what about 2022 thus far over five tests my average levine's biological age is 33.9 years now besides just looking at differences for average values year to year we can compute whether this is a statistically significant reduction or not by using a two-sample t-test and when i do that right now it's a borderline significant biological age difference 2021 versus 2022 with a p-value of 0.05 so if i'm able to keep the biological score less than 35.6 i would expect that this would be statistically significant so let's see if i can keep it up or keep it lower for the next couple tests so this is one way of looking at the biological age score another is by looking at the difference between chronological age and biological age and prior to 2022 my average reduction chronological age minus biological age was about 12 years so 11.9 years to be specific and that was over 15 tests prior to this year so thus far in 2022 we can see that the average chronological age minus biological age reduction was greater than 12 years in each of the five tests with an average reduction of 15.3 years thus far for 2022 so off to a good start in 2022. Now what i haven't shown you yet is how good is this metric for its correlation with chronological age and its association with all-cause mortality risk so first starting with the correlation data with uh chronological age we can see that that was evaluated in two separate studies first in nhanes three which included about ten thousand people and the correlation for levine's biological age test with chronological age was very strong at 0.94 and then it was also tested in another study nhanes 4 which included more than 11 000 people and that correlation was 0.96 for the venus test with chronological age and we can see this visually represented here so we've got levine's phenotypic phenotypic age score on the y-axis there and then that's plotted against chronological age and then we can see that very strong linear correlation for levine's biological age score with chronological age with the red line now note that levine's chronological age correlation of 0.94 to 0.96 in two separate studies is as good as the best epigenetic clock for its correlation with chronological age which is the horvath epigenetic clock and this data is here and i went further in depth into my own horvath epigenetic age in my last video and if you missed that it'll be in the right corner so what we're looking at here on the y-axis is dna mh so this this is dna methylation age or more specifically epigenetic age using the horvath clock and that's plotted against chronological age and then we can see a lot of different colored circles so this is a multi-cell and tissue clock including cells from breast cells buccal cells or cheek cells brain colon cord blood dermis or skin and so on so when looking at the correlation for horvath's epigenetic clock with chronological age we can see that that correlation is very strong at 0.94 which is very close or identical to levine's biological age test for the blood-based biomarker panel so what about all-cause mortality risk how's levine's test related to that so here we can see that an older biological age using levine's test is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and that's what we're looking at here all-cause mortality and in this study it was more than 11 000 people and we can see that for every one year increase for biological age using levine's test all-cause mortality risk increased by nine percent as you can see that hazard ratio is 1.09 so that's a nine a nine percent increase and more specifically note the 95 percent ci or confidence interval 1.08 to 1.1 so it's completely above the hazard ratio of one so we've got a statistically significant effect now this effect was also true uh regardless of whether it was in young middle age or older adults so we can see that an older biological age using levine's test was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk of 13 10 and 8 percent in young middle and older adults respectively so what about disease specific mortality so an older biological age using levine's test was associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease but not cerebrovascular disease so we're going to skip a red hour there diabetes related mortality influenza or pneumonia and interesting interesting sorry interestingly along those lines in a study published last year an older biological age more than a decade before the pandemic was associated with an increased mortality risk in covet 19 patients so having an older biological age more than 10 years before being infected with soros cov2 those people had an increased mortality risk and then last but not least an older biological age using levine's test is associated with mortality related to kidney issues including nephritis or nephrosis now note that levene's test isn't the only blood-based biomarker panel that can assess biological age and i've shown this in other videos but aging.ai is another one that we can use and this this too is free to use which is which is a benefit so aging.ai is strongly correlated with biological age and in its case it doesn't include chronological age in its model whereas levine's test includes chronological age so as i mentioned it's free to use and you can use it there at aging.ai that's aging.ai very simple straightforward and the data that i'm going to show refers to aging.eye 3.0 there are a few other iterations 1 and 2.0 but this is aging.ai 3.0 so it includes 19 biomarkers or 19 input parameters and these are blood biomarkers that are commonly found on the standard chemistry panel and complete blood count or cbc and those two tests together are about 35 usd and when you include a high sensitivity c reactive protein it comes out to about eighty dollars to measure both uh uh the levine's test and aging.ei or for just aging.ei without uh crp high sensitivity crp 35 usd so relatively affordable is what i'm trying to get at all right so aging.ai is uh strongly correlated with chronological age as shown there it has a correlation of 0.8 not as strong as the venus test or horvath's test but still stronger than some of the best epigenetic clocks including hanam's test which again i covered in my last video which has a correlation of with chronological age of 0.68 so 0.8 for aging.ei is pretty good all right what about all-cause mortality risk so biological ages that were younger than their corresponding chronological age were associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and note that this study and all the earlier studies that i referenced would be also in the video's description so just to highlight that looking at data this was shown in a canadian cohort so people who had aging.ai ages that were more than five years older than their chronological age as shown there had an increased all-cause mortality risk and then conversely people who had aging.ai biological ages that were more than five years younger than their chronological age had he significantly reduced all caused mortality risk as shown by the green arrow and these data were basically replicated in a u.s cohort and haynes as shown there for older biological age increased all-cause mortality risk and conversely younger biological age decreased all-cause mortality risk using aging.ai all right so what's my aging.ai age for test number five in 2022 so here are the data for the 19 component biomarkers if anybody wants to double check the the numbers they can just go to aging.ai put in my data and see what they get and note that this is using the north american data set which i use for every blood test to be consistent so when i enter these data into into aging.ai i get a predicted age of 31.0 years which is 18.6 years younger than my chronological so just like we did for levine's test this is only data for one test so for more context let's let's have a look at aging.ei results since 2009. I have data that goes back a lot farther than levine's test data and i have up to 35 blood tests over that time span and that's what we can see here so uh early on in 2009 i was going to the doctor to get my blood tested i was only going about once a year so from 2009 to 2013 i only have three blood tests as shown in purple and we can see that my aging.ai age was 32 years and then in 2016 i started having blood test kits sent to me in the mail and then i'd bring them to the lab where their quest or lab corp and then i'd have them draw my blood and then send the blood out for analysis so skipping having to go to the doctor to get my blood tested so over that time span from 2016 to 2021 i blood tested 27 times with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years so what about 2022 thus far in five tests my average aging.ai age is 29 years so from this we can see that my aging.ei age is consistently in the 29 to 32 year range regardless of what my chronological age was during that time span so i've mentioned this in earlier videos in quantifying biolite biological age videos are there weaknesses in my data am i missing something potentially and if there is a weakness in my data besides creatinine of 1.04 and i think that's an easy fix though a little bit more complicated maybe the total cholesterol story which as you can see mine there is 133 milligrams per deciliter but it may not be what you think in terms of uh how it relates to all-cause mortality risk and its age-related changes so uh the total cholesterol story and this will be in my next video the total cholesterol story that i'm going to present involves dhes dhea sulfate testosterone and cortisol so in the interest of time i'm going to end that there we'll see that in the next video and i'm hustling to get it done i i expect to have it uh on on my channel probably by wednesday at the latest all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and uh before you go discount links if you're interested in measuring your epigenetic age using horvaths hannams and dunedin pace i've got a discount link in the video's description for for that if you want to quantify your oral microbiome composition and note that i sent out my second sample after my first biohacking oral microbiome video a while ago so my second sample is out for analysis so i should get that data back any day so i'll make a video on that once i get the results if you're interested in measuring your own oral microbiome that too a link discount link will be in the video's description if you want to track your diet as i do with chronometer got we've got a discount link for that or if you want to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day you
