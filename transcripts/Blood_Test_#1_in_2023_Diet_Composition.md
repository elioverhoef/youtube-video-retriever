# Blood Test #1 in 2023: Diet Composition

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For the first blood test in 2023 we saw that my biological age using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator phenowage was 33 years which is 17 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai it was 28 years which is 22 years younger than my chronological so the obvious question should be what's contributing to these data so let's start off by looking at supplements so in terms of the first two this should this is a standard i've covered this in earlier videos i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine every day since then secondly for about eight months out of the year i supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day now there are two new entrants for supplemental intake and that's the first is glycine so i supplemented with two grams of glycine per day for 39 of the 42 days that correspond to this blood test and i also supplemented with a probiotic known as streptococcus salivarius and the goal there was to help optimize my oral microbiome and then for 13 days of the 42 that for that corresponds to this blood test i supplemented with this probiotic but note that there was no dramatic improvement or worsening of biological age data it with the addition of glycine and or streptococcusyl various for this test for example although my biological age for this using levine's test was 33 that's within the range of around my lowest biological age data that i experienced in 2022. Similarly for aging.ai i also had other 28s three of them in particular for 2022 and the 26 so one could argue that the addition of glycine and or streptococcus salivarius didn't impact my biological age metrics which then brings us to diet so what diet composition corresponds to this blood test so in terms of the period that corresponds to this blood type test it's from december 12 2022 through january 22nd 2023 and more specifically the importance of december 12th is that was the date for blood test number seven in 2023 so the dietary period starts immediately after the blood test as i'm fasted prior to that until the day before blood test number one which was january 22nd so that's a 42-day period that corresponds to test number one in 2023. So here we can see the full dietary breakdown ranked in grams at the top to the to the lowest which is uh 47 i i ate 47 different foods uh with the lowest intake being vanilla beans now the first question would be why are these foods at the top why are these top seven foods at the top and i've covered that in earlier videos for those who've missed it though i'm going to do a youtube live stream my second live stream on this channel and that'll be tomorrow at 2pm eastern standard time so if you're interested interested in that come to the channel and check it out now note that we can see on the list glycine and as i mentioned before before i supplemented with two grams per day for 39 days and we can see that for this 42 day period i correspondingly averaged 1.9 grams of glycine per day and that was the intention of lowering homocysteine and it didn't work i covered that uh two videos ago now my diet isn't uh purposely clean all the time though and for this 42 day period i did have two cheat days now i've i've noticed that if i go beyond two uh or even at two i start to think about junk food more often so two is my limit in terms of how many days that i'll have less nutritious or quote-unquote junk food so for the first this is a standard after the blood test i'll have some junk and in this case it was a chocolate bar i put peanut butter on top and then i put grape jelly on top of that and to be honest it's like it's almost as good as cheeks cheesecake if not better and then on the second cheat day i had three slices of brooklyn pizza you can see pizza makes the ranking at number 20 and that's in calories not in grams so that at 24 calories per day is a thousand calories divided by 42 days so i had three slices of pizza um so that's that the two cheat days for that all right now this list is ranked in grams which foods are top contributors for calories and that's what we're going to see here top 10 foods for average daily calorie intake over the 42 day period that corresponds to the first test in 2023. So note that first that this is uh this data these data are from diet tracking with chronometer and there'll be a discount link for chronometer in the video's description so if you're interested in that check it out so in terms of the number one food in terms of average calories per day that's from sardines you can see i average about 233 calories per day from sardines and then just going through the list a little bit we can see that nuts and seeds make a prominent entry on this list almonds right there so i include almonds for their vitamin e as we'll see later i shoot for a vitamin e goal of about 20 milligrams or more specifically 20 milligrams per day i include coconut butter because for whatever reason in my data saturated fat is positively correlated with hdl and hdl in using my approach tends to be lower than it should with values hovering around 45 milligrams per deciliter so coconut butter is significantly correlated or actually saturated fat is significantly correlated with higher hdl in my data so i include some to try to keep my h hdl trending towards higher not relatively lower we can also see flax seeds in my case omega-3 is significantly correlated with lower creatinine as an index of kidney function so flax seeds are a very concentrated source of omega-3 as are the sardines but also so are walnuts so i include walnuts for the omega-3 but also the essential fatty acids omega-6 more specifically and then rounding out the list we see strawberries which shouldn't be a surprise because they're their number one food in terms of intake and grams barley and steel cut oats and then also beets all right so we've seen diet composition what about macros and micros how do they correspond to this blood test so first we'll see that my calorie intake or energy intake average calorie intake per day was 21.94 per day and that's my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015. My previous low was actually the last blood test in 2022 of 2235 calories per day now i intend on going lower at some point but i'm not going to reduce it below 21.94 until i hit a body weight plateau or a weight loss plateauism trying to get as lean as i physically can protein intake that corresponded to this test was about 97 grams per day and that equates to about 18 of total calories in terms of total fat i averaged 82 and a half grams of fat per day which is about 34 of total calories and if you're interested in how that fat breaks down including monounsaturated polyunsaturated including omega-3 and omega-6 saturated trans fatty acids and cholesterol that's listed there all right what about carbohydrate intake and that's what we can see here so starting from the top total carbs were 304 about 304 grams per day and while that may seem like a lot note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber so for this test average fiber intake was about 86 grams per day so when we subtract that from the total carbs we get a net carbs of about 220 grams per day now if we multiply that by four calories per gram we can figure out what percentage of calories come from net carbs for for this that corresponds to this blood test so when we do that we get about 870 39 calories and when divided by the average daily calorie intake then multiplied by 100 we can see that my net carb intake was 40 percent of total calories now in an earlier video actually the last video uh in this series that corresponded to blood test number seven's diet i mentioned that there may be a glitch in chronometers carb counts and thanks to some youtube viewers who posted it in the comments they noted that fiber is counted as 2.2 calories per gram by chronometer so when we multiply 2.2 by about 86 grams and before doing that note that fibers fermented fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids more specifically acetate propionate and butyrate so then we can add those 189 calories from fiber as they're converted into these short chain fats we can add that to total fat and then we can compute my net macros which is what we can see here so when summing up all the fat including the amount that comes from fiber fermentation you can see that my total fat intake in percentage of calories is about 42 percent net carbs 40 and protein at about 18 percent now last but not least on this carbs list are sugars and i don't track all the sugars in terms of like glucose or lactose but i do track total fructose intake including fructose but also sucrose because half of sucrose is fructose so when adding those two together i get a total fructose and average daily total fructose intake of 57.5 grams per day and while that may seem like a lot that's actually my lowest that purposefully my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracking in 2015. My previous slope was actually the last blood test so about 59 grams per day all right so we've seen the macros and diet composition what about micronutrients how does that correspond to this blood test and that's what we can see here it may be hard to see so you may have to go full screen to see it and i noted for the last video in this series for test number seven that i do have purposeful vitamin and mineral targets including b3 or niacin beta-carotene and vitamin e but also vitamin k which i didn't highlight the last time and that's what we can see here so starting with niacin and vitamin k these are specific targets that i aim for every day and kind of craft the diet around these purposeful targets so in my case niacin and vitamin k have positive correlative scores with big picture blood biomarkers so i aim for relatively higher intakes now conversely beta-carotene and vitamin e for whatever reason have net negative correlative scores in my data so i don't aim for my highest intake i aim for below that in the case of beta-carotene that's about 50 000 micrograms per day or which equals 50 mil 50 50 milligrams of beta-carotene per day which is still a lot but it's not my highest beta-carotene intake as i as i'm following the correlations with the blood biomarkers similarly although vitamin e is above the rda of 15 milligrams per day for whatever reason in my data higher vitamin e intakes are significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going the wrong direction than right so i don't aim for my highest intake but something below that and then last but not least we can see the full mineral breakdown so if you're interested in a specific mineral and what my average intake is you can see that there now as i mentioned we're going to live stream on monday this monday tomorrow at 2 pm eastern standard time so if you're interested in that check it out we can cover which nutrients correlate with blood biomarkers in my data which may or may not may or may not apply to other people but i think it's good to show that data and that's data for more than 40 blood tests since 2015 as i've tracked diet along that period too also i'd be happy to answer any questions or comments or you can just ask me anything so if you're interested in all this stuff come to the live stream on tomorrow and uh we'll do it all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in and links for all this will be in the video's description with discount links for nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing and diet tracking and note that i'm i've used or i'm currently using all of these uh places so if you're interested in discounts to use them yourself all of that will be in the video's description if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and that link will also be in the video's description and last but not least we've got merch so again if you're interested in merch and you want to support the channel and rock the conquer aging ord or die trying brand that too will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
