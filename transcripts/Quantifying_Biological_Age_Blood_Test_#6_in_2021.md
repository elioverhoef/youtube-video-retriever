# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #6 in 2021

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind earlier this week i blood tested for the sixth time in 2021 and using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric of biological age we can see that my biological age is 36.9 years which is 12 years younger than my chronological age now for more context because this is only one blood test let's have a look at the other five biological age results using morgan levine's test in 2021 and that's what's shown here so morgan levine's biological age on the y axis plotted against time and so starting with my most recent data 36.9 years that's approximately the same as my last test a couple months ago 37.1 but nowhere near as good as my first test earlier this year of 32.7 years so for those six tests my average biological age using levine's test is 35.6 years so how did these data compare with 2020 data so year over year comparison and that's what's shown here so starting with my lowest value which was 33.5 years i also had a higher value of 39.8 years and the average for those six tests in 2020 was also 35.6 years so even though the averages of 2020 and 2021 are similar or the same we can evaluate whether they're statistically significantly uh the same or different using a two-sample t-test and when i did that these two groups of data uh so 2020 versus 2021 are not significantly different so one could say that my biological age has been stable over these 12 blood tests at 35.6 years now note that i have three blood tests from 2018 to 2019 and over those three tests my average levine biological age is 36.1 years now three tests is probably not enough to get an overall assessment for uh biological age i think you need more data and i trust that the data for 12 blood tests more than i trust the data for three blood tests now note that even if all nine biomarkers on levine's test stay the same year over year biological age increases by 0.9 years for every one year increase for chronological age in contrast aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so with that in mind what's my biological age using aging.ai so using aging.ai uh 3.0 and note that uh if you want to calculate your own levine's biological age i'll include a link from my website in the video's description so it's a it obviously it's a free link and so it's free to use and so is aging.ai hopefully it stays that way uh for both well at least for aging.ai the excel spreadsheet is free we can use that anytime so using aging.edi 3.0 and it's 19 blood biomarkers as shown here data for those biomarkers my biological age is 29 which is 19.9 years almost 20 years younger than my chronological age so just like we did for levine's data uh for more context let's have a look at previous aging data data uh that i have over the past few years and that's what's shown here so aging.ai h on the y-axis and it's going to be plotted against time so i have data for aging.ai starting in 2009 and note that c-reactive protein is not found on a typical uh chemistry standard blood chemistry and cbc that you get at a yearly physical it's an extra test that i've had to order and it wasn't until 2018 and 2019 that i started measuring it and then measuring it at every test in 2020 and beyond in contrast aging.iii you don't need crp so i all these blood tests are found on the uh the blood test that you get when you go to a yearly physical so i have more of that data so from 2009 to 2013 shown in purple i have three blood test measurements for agent.ei and we can see that my average age is 32 years my average biological age using aging.ei now note that i wasn't tracking my diet and what i mean by that is if you haven't seen other videos in 2015 i started tracking my diet by weighing all my food logging it using a chronometer and then looking for correlations between my diet with the biomarkers in an attempt to optimize the biomarkers so i started diet tracking as i mentioned in 2015 going forward and starting in 2016 i have data for aging.ai using that approach so when looking at the number of blood tests and my average for each year since 2016 let's have a look at that data so in 2016 over two blood tests using aging.ai got an age of 28 for the average 29.3 average over four blood tests in 2017 and although it's hard to see over six blood tests in 2018 it was 29.5 30.3 average over three tests in 2019 and then six blood tests in 2020 with an average uh aging age of 31.3 now it should be obvious that there's an increasing biological age here from 2016 to 2020. And fortunately for the six tests in 2021 my aging ai age was 29.8 which is definitely going in the right direction and as i mentioned when i get my blood test data i look for correlations between diet with the with the blood biomarkers and then tried different interventions to try to optimize all of these blood biomarkers and more so my average over these 27 tests since i started tracking my diet and using regular interventions based on that data is 29.9 years so as a summary of my aging.ai data since i started tracking diet and attempting these various interventions i've been able to keep my aging.ai range in the 28 to 31 year old range all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
