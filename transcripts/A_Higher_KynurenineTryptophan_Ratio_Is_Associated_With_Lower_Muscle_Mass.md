# A Higher Kynurenine/Tryptophan Ratio Is Associated With Lower Muscle Mass

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

During aging there is an increase in inflammation which together are known as inflammaging the importance of inflammaging is that it induces expression of the enzyme ido otherwise known as indolamine 23 dioxygenase ido catalyzes the degradation of the amino acid tryptophan into curine and taking it a step further the importance of the cur to trip the fan ratio is that it increases during aging and i covered that in an earli video if you missed it it'll be in the right corner and a relatively higher curine at trp toan ratio is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk which is what we'll see here with the hazard ratio for all cause mortality on the y axis or all cause mortality risk plotted against the kaner nripan ratio on the x and in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and there we can see that when the ktr was in the 15 to 23 range that was associated with lowest all cause mortality risk whereas relatively higher values greater than 25 were associated with a significantly increased all cause mortality risk but the con urine to trip thean ratio isn't just associated with aging and all cause mortality risk it's also associated with reduced muscle mass and that's what we'll see here in this study of 85y olds on the left we've got the conning to trip the fan ratio and then there are three groups uh across the columns on the left we we've got the lowest tertile or lowest third of d3c this is detarium labeled creatine this is the method that they use to quantify muscle mass and this method has been shown to associate uh with mri determined muscle mass so it's a good technique so in the red box is the lowest third people who are in the lowest third for having uh muscle mass divided by body weight and then we've got the middle third of people for muscle mass divided by body weight and then the highest muscle mass divided by body weight and then when looking at kerning to trip thean values that were in each of these groups we can see that the group that had the lowest muscle mass to body weight ratio had the highest coning to trip the fan ratio of 0.45 and then the group that had an intermediate level of muscle mass to body weight ratio had a lower level of the coning to trip thean ratio and the group that had the highest muscle mass had the lowest kanur to trip the fan ratio so from this study which will be in the videos description we can see that a higher conine to trip thean ratio is associated with lower muscle mass and conversely a lower conine to trip thean ratio is associated with higher levels of muscle mass now rather than just looking at this data in a published study the good news is that this ratio can be tracked and potentially optimized so with that in mind what's my data so to evaluate that i've been sending blood using atome metabolomics using iolo's metabolomic kit and besides con and tryptophan and includes data for 600 met other metabolites and if you want to use it yourself discount link in the video's description so i currently have data for eight tests for the con to trip thean ratio as we'll see here with the conning trip thean ratio on the y ais and then over five tests in 2023 average ktr was 24 n nanomer per micromolar and if you remember from the all cause mortality data lowest all cause mortality risk was in the 15 to 23 range so i'm just outside of that but somewhat good news is that i'm not at a higher risk for all cause mortality granted it's just one test if this was my data for 50 years it would be you know i'd be worried but uh or one group of tests five tests all cause mortality risk was associated with a ktr of 25 greater than 25 so 24 isn't at the lowest risk and it's not at the highest risk it's somewhere in the middle so i've got work to do to improve that so that was 2023 dat uh 2023 data what about in 2024 so i currently have three tests and the average ktr over these three tests is now 23 so i'm at the high end of the range for lowest all cause mortality risk but i'd like to get it to go a little bit lower far away from the 25 so with that in mind can the age related conine and tryptophan ratio increase be avoided and at this point in the video i usually post correlations with diet as a first pass strategy to improve biomarkers and that data is currently on patreon but before going and checking that out i should mention that nothing was significantly uh correlated with the ktr including macros micros and foods following test number eight now i sent a sample for analysis on monday so after those results come in in about 3 weeks i'll recalculate correlations post them on patreon and the correlations tier so check that out if you're interested before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including at home metabolomics epigenetic testing ned quantification or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cy fox health which includes apob and grimage green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
