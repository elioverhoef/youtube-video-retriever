Nad is involved in mechanisms that impact health and function and its levels depend on a balance between factors that increase it or decrease it factors that increase nad include physical activity supplementation with nmn or nr calorie restriction cr and then inhibitors of cd38 now factors that decrease nad include aging physical inactivity or sedentary behavior and eating too many calories caloric excess so uh how does nad impact health and function well one mechanism involves sirtuins so sirtuins are nad-dependent proteins that can extend lifespan more specifically sirtuins remove acetyl groups from histones and proteins and there are seven sirtuins as shown in this uh picture of the cell uh some are found in the nucleus the cytosol and others like sirtuins three four and five are found in mitochondria so uh my interest is lifespan which sirtuins extend lifespan and in this video i'm going to talk about the data and show the data for certain one and certi-6 and then sir t1 is the most popular sirtuin but is it the best for extending lifespan and also which interventions increase sirtuins so let's have a look at the data so first brain specific uh certain one over expression so higher levels of certain one only in the brain extends lifespan so we're looking what we're looking at here are is the survival probability on the y-axis plotted against age in days and this is combined data for both males and females with a wild type b uh with the black bar the dark line and the mice that have higher levels of certain one in the brain tg transgenic so when putting up the average uh survival this is the point where half of the colony has died and half is still alive we can see that there's a significant extension in lifespan average lifespan for brain-specific certain one over-expression but not an increase in maximal lifespan now uh with this in mind what's you know it some may have you may have an animal model that's got higher levels of cert t1 but how can we apply this to people so one way we can do that is with sir t1 activators and the most popular cert t1 activator is resveratrol so resveratrol was initially shown to extend average lifespan 15 years ago and that's what we can see here so when looking at average survival for mice that were fed a high calorie diet the red line when compared with mice that were fed the standard diet the black line uh and when compared with animals that were fed the high calorie diet plus resveratrol the blue line we can see that having resveratrol in the diet on a high calorie diet extended lifespan when compared with animals that did did not have resveratrol in their diet so uh the obvious question should be uh sure resveratrol was given an extended average lifespan in this mouse model of diet induced obesity but how do we know that certain one is involved so uh sirtuins remove acetyl groups and a well known marker of certain one activity is by looking at acetylation of the pgc1 alpha protein which is shown on the y-axis here so uh in the situation where the high-calorie diet was fed we can see the black bar is very high which suggests lower certain one activity especially when considering that certains remove acetyl groups however in the condition where the high calorie diet hc was uh fed with resveratrol the gray bars we can see that there's a significant reduction in pgc1 alpha acetylation which suggests that there's higher certain one activity in this case it's about 60 to 70 percent higher certain one activity in the uh mice that were fed resveratrol on that high calorie diet all right so uh certain one over expression in brain and certain one activation via resveratrol increase lifespan but both low and high dose resveratrol have been shown to not extend lifespan and that's we're looking at here with data from males on the left females on the right and the red arrow in both of these pictures is when they started resveratrol supplementation so first notice that the low dose was resveratrol at a concentration of 300 parts per parts per million ppm and then they supplemented the mice with a four-fold higher concentration 1200 ppm so as you can see by the p-values for both the males on the left and the females for the right these values are higher than 0.05 which shows that resv both low and high dose resveratrol did not significantly extend lifespan in this study similarly sir t1 overexpression has been shown to not affect lifespan in other studies and that's what's shown here so again we're looking at survival uh percentage on the y-axis plotted against uh time in months and in this study they had two separate lines of certain one over expressing mice uh defined as tg transgenic a and b the two different lines and then we can combine that data so we're looking at combined data from males and females on the left males in the middle and females on the right and what we can see based on the p values is that certain one over expression did not extend lifespan for males and females males alone or females alone so with this in mind how does certain one compare against sir t6 for lifespan extension and interestingly a study was just published last week that compared these two sirtuins head-to-head for lifespan and that's what we can see here so again we're looking at survival on the y-axis uh plotted against age in days how long the mice live so looking at the the different lines we can see that the wild type the normal animals that don't have higher levels of sirtuins are the blue lines uh mice that have higher levels of uh certain one are in red higher certain six in green and then they over over expressed both sir t1 and sir t6 and that's the purple line so first starting with sir t1 the red line when looking at average survival we can see that there was no significant significant increase in lifespan average or maximal for cert t1 over expressing mice when compared with wild type but what about sir t6 and we can see that shift in the lifespan curves to the right so having higher levels of sir t6 significantly increase both both average lifespan and maximal lifespan and this is in the pool data for males and females so how does the data look separately in males and females is is this effect driven by one one gender or the other well we can see that the this effect is found in both males and females for the cert t6 over expressing mice so average lifespan and maximal lifespan were increased in both the males and in the female mice that had higher levels of certi-6 so based on this data we could uh conclude that cert having higher levels of certain t6 may be better than sir t1 for extending lifespan now also is an interesting aside note that the purple curves where they over expressed both one cert t1 and 36 did not extend lifespan uh uh longer than sir t6 alone which suggests that these having higher levels of 31 and 36 is not additive that having higher cert6 alone is required for that lifespan extending effect now other studies have shown certi-6 can improve lifespan and that's what that's what's shown here uh in this in this study they engineered mice to have higher levels of certain six in two separate groups of mice defined as line 55 on the on the left and line 108 on the right so starting with the line 55 we can see that there was an increased average and maximal lifespan in these male mice that had higher levels where engineers had higher levels of sir t6 and then for the line 108 there was an increase in average but not maximal lifespan but this isn't a perfect story because for whatever reason lifespan in the cert t6 transgenic female mice was not extended so with this in mind how does certain six extend lifespan well certi-6 has been shown to positively affect many hallmarks of aging so starting from sir t6 we can see that it's involved in mechanisms that uh maintain telomere length and that's important because telomere length isn't maintained during aging it shortens uh now certain having relatively higher levels of cert t6 also involve the mechanisms that reduce oxidative stress oxidative stress increases during aging so uh by certi-6 being able to uh be involved the mechanisms that reduce oxidative stress that's potentially important for aging now certain 6 is also involved in mechanisms that promote dna damage repair and this is whether this is whether sir t6 is involved mechanisms that repair single strand dna breaks and double strand dna breaks certain six is also involved in mechanisms that reduce inflammation including uh reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il1 beta il-6 and tnf-alpha while increasing expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and finally certi-6 is involved in mechanisms that promote autophagy which also declines during aging so can certain 6 then be increased through diet exercise or supplements you know having transgenic animals that are engineered to have that is nice but can we activate certain to gain some of these benefits on aging and potentially lifespan so first sir t6 is increased by calorie restriction and this is a study done in male mice if anybody's come across calorie restriction studies in female mass female mice please leave a comment uh i wasn't able to find that so we're looking at levels of cert t6 protein levels of certain six on the y-axis divided by a loading control gap dh so when compared with mice that were able allowed to eat as much as they want al ad-lib we can see that the mice that were fed 30 less calories and in this case these were old mice 20 month a 24 month old mice which is equivalent to about a 73 year old person we can see that there was about a fifty percent increase in protein levels of certain six in the mice that were thirty percent cr now this implicates a role for diet or at least calories on on certain six levels are there more specific dietary components that can increase uh dietary components that can increase their t6 and one of them is ergothioneine now ergothioneine has been dubbed a longevity vitamin and if you and i have a video on it so if you missed that i'm going to link to it in the right corner so in this study they looked at sir t6 protein expression and this was an in vitro study in endothelial cells so starting with cells that did not have high glucose this is uh the control cell so ctr adding a relatively high amount of glucose to these cells to endothelial cells resulted in lower levels of certi6 protein now adding ergothioneine to the control cells didn't impact certain 6 levels but in the cells that had high glucose and ergothioneine we can see that certi-6 levels were significantly increased when compared to high glucose alone so why is this important what does it have to do with aging well glucose levels systemic levels circulating levels of glucose increase during aging which raises the question can ergothioneine increase certain 6 in older adults as glucose levels increase during aging older adults more often than not have higher levels of plasma uh higher plasma levels of glucose so there aren't any randomized controlled trials rcts that have tested this yet but i'd stay tuned hopefully those studies will get done now there are many other certi-6 activators and i've listed them here and there are so many of them that i'll probably make another video uh in terms of which foods are rich you know are rich for each of these metabolites but notice that two of them right off the top quercetin and luteolin are known cd38 inhibitors so they're involve the mechanisms that increase nad so not only may do they increase not only are they involve the mechanism that mechanisms that increase nad that they're known sir t6 activators they're also involved in mechanisms that activate certain six so you're getting a double whammy of higher nad which is potentially good for health and lifespan and also higher certain six so what about exercise so in this data we can see that an acute bout of exercise in this case this was uh 30 minutes of running at 80 percent of vo2 max and this is a relatively small study done in 24 24 year old men uh so acute acute exercise resulted in about a two-fold higher expression of certain 6 levels in white blood cells so blood samples were obtained before exercise immediately after exercise so post exercise and then one hour after exercise and what we can see when compared with both pre-exercise and post-exercise is that the certain levels were approximately doubled as a result of 30 minutes of running at 80 percent of the vo2 max on the treadmill now it isn't just aerobic exercise and acute exercise so one bout of exercise sir t6 has also been shown to be increased after 12 weeks of resistance exercise training so strength training in 66 year old men in also a relatively small study 30 subjects but nonetheless it shows an important role for exercise whether it's cardiovascular training or strength training to potentially increase certain levels in people all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
