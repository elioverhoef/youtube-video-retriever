# Optimizing Glutathione's Component Amino Acids Without Supplements

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Glutathione declines during aging and that's what we'll see in three different studies so on the y- axis we've got glutathione levels or gsh plotted against age and for each of these studies we can see the age related decline 50% in the first study 15% in the second study and 33% in the third study but then the question is why does glutathione decline during aging so glutathione is a tripeptide that's comprised of glutamate cysteine and glycine these are amino acids and we can see glutathione's chemical structure shown here as it's a tripeptide comprised of glutamate cysteine and glycine which then raises the question do levels levels of these amino acids glutamate cysteine and or glycine decline during aging as a potential explanation for why glutathione declines during aging so plasma levels of glycine and cysteine are lower in older adults and that's what we'll see in results from this study which included 40-year-olds and 70-year olds so when looking at plasma levels of glycine to start there in the young subjects it was 487 micromolar but only 218 micromolar in the 70y olds similarly plasma levels of cysteine were also lower in the 70y olds 26.2 micromolar in the 40y olds and about 20 micromolar in the 70y olds but levels of glutamate plasma levels of glutamate were not different when comparing the 40 with the 70y olds so one study is important but as a weakness in this study note that it only included eight subjects per group and this is a relatively small sample size so if we're looking for populationbased averages larger studies are the goal or evidence from larger studies is the goal so one that i was able to find had a larger sample size so are plasma levels of these amino acids different with a larger sample size so here we're looking at plasma levels of glycine again in young and older adults and now the young adult group was an average age had an average age of 30 years and now there were 20 of them so just in the young group the sample size was already larger than the previous study which only had 16 but the older adult group which had an average age of 66 years there were 120 of them so we've got a bit of a larger sample size ideally i'd like to see thousands or larger for plasma levels of glutamate cinee and glycine and if anyone's come across studies that large for population based averages please post it in the comments and i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video once again using a relatively larger sample size we can see plasma levels of glycine are indeed lower in the older adults all right so what about cysteine so that's what we're looking at here total levels of cysteine and blood in the young and older adults and now we see the opposite is true in the larger sample size to study with the larger sample size plasma levels of cysteine were higher in the older adults when compared with the younger adults so from these two studies we can see that plasm glycine is again lower but cysteine is is higher in one study and significantly lower in the other so inconsistent inconsistent data but what about glutamate now here too i wasn't able to find very large studies so here too if you if anyone's come across those studies please post it in the comments but when considering that each of these three amino acids is required to make glutathione if we track and optimize them can we help keep glutathione relatively high and avoid its age related decline so to track levels of these amino acids i've been using atom metabolomics more specifically iolo's metabolomic kit which besides these three amino acids contains more than 600 metabolites and i've covered many of them on the channel if you've missed that i'll link to the metab metabolomics playlist in the right corner and if you want to measure levels of these amino acids or many other metabolites there's a discount link in the video's description all right so what's my data so first starting with plasma levels of glycine in 2023 over five tests average plasma glycine was 283 micro in 2024 over seven tests it's 518 micromolar and rather than just looking at two different uh years based on averages we can compare them with a two sample t test and when i did that this is significantly higher 518 micromolar that 2024 data 2024's data is significantly higher with a p value of 0.02 less than 0.05 being the threshold for significance when compared with 2023 data all right what about plasma levels of cine so similar story 11 micromolar average in 2023 over 5 tests 30 micromolar average over 7 tests in 2024 and here too two sample t test significantly higher in 2024 when compared with 2023 what about plasma levels of glutamate so 2023 average 129 micromolar over five tests and in 2024 thus far over seven tests 214 micromolar and here too a significant increase so that then raises the question have i been supplementing with levels of these amino acids to have higher levels higher relative levels in 2024 relative to 2023 and i have not but then the next obvious question could be what about protein intake if protein intake is higher in 2024 versus 2023 could that explain the higher levels plasma levels of these amino acids as proteins are comprised of amino acids that would seem to be an easy place to look so i can look at those data because i've been tracking diet every day since 2015 weighing it on a food scale entering it into chronometer then putting that data into a spreadsheet so here we're going to take a look at the average daily protein intake and note that each dot corresponds to the average daily protein intake that corresponds to that test now it's not the day before the test for a quick review for people who may be unfamiliar if there are 50 days in between tests because i'm tracking diet every day and weighing all of my food the average intake for that 50-day period then corresponds with the latter test now every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake not just protein intake but calories and macros and micros and other foods and then with enough data for blood tests and diet i can look at correlations so average daily protein intake that corresponded to each of these tests in 20123 was 98 g per day and then a bit higher in 2024 and when using a two sample t test it was just outside of statistical significance but it's very close to being lower than that less than 0.05 threshold but is a 6 g per day average protein uh uh intake increase is that enough to almost double or in some cases triple looking at plasma levels of cysteine plasma levels i'm not sure which then raises the question are other dietary components significantly associated with relatively higher levels of these amino acids so now we're going to take a look at 12 test correlations with diet which includes macro micronutrients and foods for glycine cysteine and glut and note that the p value for each of on each of these tables is less than 0.05 but in the interest of space i can't fit them all and if you want to see the full correlation list those are on the correlations tier on patreon and it doesn't just include correlations for these three amo acids includes many other biomarkers too so if you're interested in that check it out now note that when i'm looking at uh all of these correlations with these three amino acids for each amino acid there are 86 comp comparisons meaning u macronutrients micronutrients and foods in total those are 8 there are 86 of them and then i looked at correlations for each of these three amino acids in other words there were 258 total comparisons and the reason i raised that point is because with using a p value less than 0.05 that means that five out of 100 could be expected to be false positives so with 258 different comparisons i could expect to see around 13 of these significant correlations being false positives and not real correlations just statistical noise so one way to account for that is the false discovery rate and i've use that approach in other videos i've even published in academic papers using that approach and i'm a fan of it when using studies when you can't get closer to causation however i'm going to use a different approach in this video and before we go there just note that the lowercase r is the correlation coefficient and what that means is if a value is positive in that column that means that higher levels of the food or nutrient is significantly correlated with higher levels of the amino acid glycine cysteine or glutamate conversely if it's a negative correlation that means higher intake of the food or nutrient is significantly correlated with lower levels of the amino acid all right so what's the approach instead of using the false discovery rate so i want to know is there a common theme across all three amino acids i find it hard to believe that just picking three amino acids that you know i've got this basically all of them increasing by relatively similar amount and it doesn't seem obvious that a 6 g per day increase in protein intake would close to double their level so i want to see first if there's a common theme across all three of these amino acids so we can see that oranges iron intake and fiber are significantly correlated with glycine cysteine and glutamate and in other words you can see i've coated them green which means that higher levels ass so significantly correlated with higher levels of these amino acids on the other on the other side on the other hand higher levels of sodium oats barley lowfat yogurt and parmesan cheese are significantly correlated with lower levels of these amino acids but also note that calories make the list so and these are negative correlations for all three amino acids in other words a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with lower levels of glycine cysteine and glutamate which then raises the question are the overlapping uh significant significantly overlapping correlations so the reds and greens the eight overlapping uh correlations for each of these amino acids are they still significant after accounting for protein intake which seems like an obvious factor that we should account for and calorie intake or are protein intake and calorie intake driving most of the association for higher levels of these three amino acids in 2024 versus 2023 so a first question to ask just as an illustrative example we'll use fiber so is fiber intake signif l associated with plasma levels of glycine after adjusting for protein and calorie intake and to figure that out i built a linear regression model which sounds a lot more fancy than it is it's not that it's not that complicated and this is the combined association for glycine versus calorie intake protein intake and fiber intake so in other words after adjusting now for calories and protein intake fiber intake is still significantly positively associated with glycine and you can see that the coefficient is positive the p value is less than 0.05 and the significance f which is a measure of the sign significance of the collective model now we're looking at the combined association for calories protein and fiber against glycine is also less than 0.05 so it's a significant model so these data suggest that after accounting for calorie and protein intake a relatively higher fiber intake is significantly associated with higher levels of glycine so fiber may also be a part of the relatively higher levels of amino acid story but remember i want to look at overlapping associations not for just glycine but the other amino acids so what's that story another words is fiber intake and the other overlapping association significantly associated with plasma glutamate and and cysteine after adjusting for protein intake so now we're going to put up another column the calorie and protein adjusted p value for each of these three amino acids and i want to know if those eight overlapping foods or nutrients across each of these three amino acids is still still significant after adjusting linear regression models for calorie and protein intake so first starting with fiber we just saw that fiber was still significantly associated with glycine after adjusting for calorie and protein intake and it's also significantly associated with cysteine under those same conditions and glutamate so then what do i do with this information because it seems like fiber a relatively higher fiber intake may be a part of the story for keeping these levels of these amino acids relatively high which i want to do because i want to try to keep glutathione levels also relatively high so my fiber intake range over these 12 tests is 883 to 89 g per day to follow the correlation knowing that higher may be better for these three amino acids i should aim for the higher end of my intake range over these 12 tests which is 89 gam per day so i've cod that in green in contrast if i was aiming for the lower end of my range that wouldn't file a correlation and the prediction would be that if correlation implies causation and again i don't know i'd have to do the experiment if i cut protein intake to the lower end of the range i'd expect to see lower levels plasma levels of these amino acids all right so what about the other overlapping associations how do they fit into this story so when looking at oranges iron vanilla beans or sorry that should be barley vanilla beans and barley and parmesan cheese none of those were significantly associated after accounting for protein and calorie intake with glycine so i'm not going to look at the overlapping associations as i want to look for the common theme across all three amino acids associations for all three amino acids iron still significantly associated with glycine still significantly associated with cysteine and glutamate all right so here too what do i do with that information the iron intake range over those 12 tests is 30 to 34 mig per day so to follow the correlation i should aim for 34 milligram per day to try to keep levels of these plasma levels of these amino acids relatively high again assuming correlation equals a causation i don't know if that's true all i can do is follow the correlations all right and then the last overlapping association was oats so still associated with glycine still associated with cysteine but after adjusting for calorie and protein intake is not significantly associated with glutamate now these data then raise another question uh if i'm going to keep fiber and iron relatively high while accounting for protein and uh calorie and protein intake to help to try to help keep levels of these plasma plasma levels of these amino acids high that's a reductionist approach i'm basically forgetting about all other biomarkers and i don't want to just improve or increase levels of these three amino acids to help keep glutathione high i'm i'm focused on net effects what's the net effect of a higher fiber and higher iron intake on a multitude of biomarkers biomarkers that represent many organ organ systems right and and metabolic health right so uh the goal isn't to just optimize a few and forget about the others the goal is to optimize as many as possible so how are higher levels of fiber and iron associated with other biomarkers and i won't go into that story in this video if you're interested in that those data are on the correlations tier on patreon so check it out all right that's all for now if you're interested in more of my attempts to biack
