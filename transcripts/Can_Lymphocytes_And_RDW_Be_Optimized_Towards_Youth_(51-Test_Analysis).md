# Can Lymphocytes And RDW Be Optimized Towards Youth? (51-Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that fasting and the combination of calorie restriction plus fasting extends lifespan and if you missed that video it'll be in the right corner but for a quick review there were five groups of mice in this study ad lib al both one and two days of fasting two separate groups and then another two se separate groups of 20 and 40% calor restriction in terms of the lifespan increases we can see that both fasting groups significantly increase their median lifespan the 20% restricted group was a bit better and the best of the bunch was 40% cr but then the authors of this study saw that many mice lived past 35 months and in all groups this effect wasn't just restricted to the calorie restricted or to the one or two days of fasting groups but also some of the mice in the ad lib group al where they ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted also lived relatively long or past 35 months which then led the authors of this study to ask the question what might contribute to a longer lifespan independent of group assignment so regardless if the mice were in ad lib or fasting or calor restricted groups so to do that they looked at a bunch of biomarkers with levels on the y- axis plotted against the adjusted lifespan correlation on the x and without going through all of the data i'm just going to highlight a couple of biomarkers on this plot one biomarker were lymphocytes which are a type of white blood cell so having relatively higher levels of lymphocytes when the mice were 16 months old old was significantly correlated with a longer lifespan regardless of which group that the mice were in so they didn't have to necessarily be calor restricted or fasted and then on the other hand having a relatively higher rdw or red blood cell distribution with was significantly correlated with a shorter lifespan and again independent of group assignment now where this story gets interesting is that lymphocytes decline whereas the rdw increases during aging so mice that were able to resist age related changes at relatively younger ages this was significantly correlated with a longer lifespan so just to highlight that data the lifespan data for lymphocytes and the rdw that's what we'll see here this is data from the same study with lymphocytes plotted on the y- axis uh plotted against age on the x and for all five groups we can see that lyy levels decline during aging on the other hand for the rdw on the y-axis plotted against ag again on the x here too all five groups significantly increased rdw during aging so once again to highlight these data mice that were able to resist age related changes for lymphocytes had significant increase significant increases for lifespan as shown by the lymy correlation on the right and the rdw correlation on the left so these data are in mice what about in people and the story is actually very similar so for the rdw it increases during aging and that's what we see here with the rdw plotted on the y- ais against age on the x and then we can see the age related increase up to 85 years with a steeper increase for people older than 85 now the importance of that age related increase for the rdw in people is that a relatively higher rdw is significantly associated with a increased risk of death for all causes just like the data in mice all right so this is a bioh hacking focus channel and the name of the channel is conquer aging or die trying so in order to achieve that goal and not die trying i try to optimize all of my biomarkers towards youth minimizing all cause mortality risk which i expect will be uh it should improve my health and potentially increase or maximize my lifespan so i had 51 tests for the rdw over the past 9 years and that's what we'll see here with rdw plotted on the y-axis against age on the x and in terms of the correlation in my data over those 51 tests over the past 9 years we can see that there's a significant inverse correlation for rdw with chronological age in other words i've resisted or reversed the age related increase for the rdw now in the longevity space there's a lot of over hype and over you know there over overconfidence for results and i'm not here to say oh i've resisted aging and i've i've stopped aging that's not at all what i'm here to say i don't know what my data was or i only had very few data points before uh when i was 42 so i can't undo the first 42 years of whatever rdw might do to aging on the other hand can i keep the rdw relatively low indefinitely and if i can keep it relatively low indefinitely what will that do to my health and potentially lifespan based on the animal data if i'm able to keep rdw relatively low and resist an age related increase that may lead to longevity all right so what about lymphocytes so just like the animal data or the mouse data lymphocytes decline during aging in people too and that's what we'll see here with lymphocyte levels on the y-axis plotted against age on the x and in terms of the age related decline for lymphocytes we can see that with the red line and in youth average values are around 2100 all right so once again we can see that uh having higher lymphocytes is a part of the uul phenotype but also having relatively higher lymphocytes is associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes and i've covered this in an earlier video if you missed that i'll link to it in the right corner all right so what's my data just like the rdw how am i doing in terms of lymphocytes so over those same 51 tests over the past 9 years we can see that here with lymphocyte levels on the y- axis plotted against age chronological age on the x and unfortunately i have a significant age related decline for lymphocytes over this 9-year period 51 tests now the goal is to keep them relatively youthful around 2,000 for as long as i can so if i can keep them youthful for as long as i can can i flatten mortality risk and again potentially improve my health and maximize longevity so then that raises the question can i get my can i resist this age related decline and get it closer to that 2,000 average value found in youth and then what's the approach how can i do that what's the approach for slowing or potentially slowing age related biomarker changes so for those who don't know i've trapped all of my food using a food scale since 2015 i've then entered those daily food amounts into to chronometer which is a diet tracking app and i'm not here to say they're the best but that's what i've used since 2015 i then take chronometer data and then manually input that into a spreadsheet both macros and micronutrients and also foods so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests because i'm rigorously tracking diet i take the average 50-day intake that then lines up with the latter blood test so now each blood test has an average dietary intake and with enough track data for both i can look at correlations and i should note that i don't only use this approach for diet i also do this with supplements so using supplements in conjunction with tra biomarkers fitness metrics heart rate variability resting heart rate also looking at correlations with biomarket sleep metrics this approach can be used for basically everything so then i calculate correlations for diet in this case with biomarkers which then raises the question what can i potentially do to increase lymphocytes now i won't go through all of the data i post correlations on the correlations tier on patreon but one factor that may be related to having relatively higher lympocytes at least in my data it may be different for others and i can't extrapolate my findings onto others i would recommend tracking your own data to see what what may be a part of the story for you so at least in my in my data one variable that's significantly correlated with higher lymphocytes is calorie intake so here we've got lymphocytes to each blood test and then we can see that significant positive correlation between lyy levels with the average daily calorie intake now if i want to increase my lymy levels and resist that age related decline based on extrapolation of these data it would suggests that somewhere around 2,800 calories may get me to an average worst lymphocyte when considering that my recent intake is closer to around 2100 calories when considering that my highest intake that corresponds to any blood test over the past 9 years is 2800 that's about a 25% calorie restricted diet now exercise is a big part of the approach too so i'm not purely cr so just as an fyi all right so these data then raise the question what calorie intake may be best for lymphocytes without messing up other biomarkers now a big part of my approach is not just focusing on one biomarker at a time but making one biomarker improve or trying to improve one biomarker without messing up others or can i improve one biomarker or group of biomarkers more than i've made other biomarkers worse so that would be a net positive intervention so with that in mind what calorie intake may be best for lymphocytes without messing up other biomarkers and the reason i raised that question is because a relatively higher calorie intake in my data is significantly correlated with a lot more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right now i track regularly a panel of about 25 standard clinical chemistry biomarkers but also other things like blood pressure uh so in that 25 panel it's blood and uh blood pressure and uh blood pressure uh sorry blood biomarkers and also blood pressure but i'll probably also add sleep metrics including slow wave sleep percentage into that uh list relatively shortly or relatively soon nonetheless for that panel of 25 biomarkers we can see that many of them are significantly correlated with calorie intake and going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and all cause mortality risk so on this table we've got the correlation coefficient the lowercase r then we can see the p value each of these has a p value less than 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance so each of these b marker is is significantly correlated with calorie intake based on the p value and then in the far right is the lowercase and that's how many blood tests that i have that correspond to calorie intake now this list isn't sorted in any particular order but i put the rdw at the top of the list to highlight because you know we've highlighted it in the video and we can see that there's a strong positive correlation in my data with calorie intake with the rdw and note that a strong correlation is defined as having a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 so we can see here here that the correlation coefficient is 0.71 in other words for whatever reason in my data a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a higher rdw which we know from all of the data that i've just presented is going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and all cause mortality risk and also potentially longevity at least based on the mouse data so if i'm going to increase calorie intake with the goal of increasing lymphocytes i might also mess up the rdw but that's not the only biomarker that may be affected by or impacted by calorie intake so just to go through some of the others on this list uh two liver enzymes alkaline phosphor and aspartate aminot transferase those are also positive correlations with calorie intake in in other words a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher levels of these two enzymes relatively higher levels of these two proteins are significantly correlate or significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so i've given them red arrows that's going in the wrong direction dhea sulfate declines during aging so that inverse correlation also going in the wrong direction similarly hdl declines during aging so a higher calorie intake being correlated with a lower hdl is going in the wrong direction ldl is somewhat debatable we can debate this in the comments if you like but ldl levels are relatively low in youth they peak in midlife and then they decline again towards the end of life so whether this positive correlation is a sign that i'm moving towards midlife data for ldl uh or not is very debatable so i i haven't given it a red or green arrow for now higher high sorry hscrp so higher inflammation high sensitivity c reactor protein sign correlated with higher calorie intake going in the wrong direction pro-inflammatory uh immune cells like the combination of nutrifil and monocytes positive correlation also going in the wrong direction they increase during aging as does hscrp platelets that gets a green arrow because platelets decline during aging so higher calorie intake would seem to resist that age related decline s systolic blood pressure increases during aging so that's going in the wrong direction for its correlation with calorie intake and last but not least uric acid also increases during aging that positive correlation with calorie intake going in the wrong direction so we can see that in terms of calorie intake if i increase it or by in increas by too much i mess i may mess up a whole bunch of biomarkers while potentially improving lymphocytes so to get back to the original question of what calorie intake may be best for lymphocytes without messing up other biomarkers i've made a small increase to my calor intake over the past couple of tests up from my lowest intake over the past 9 years which was 28 80 calories per day so current intake is around 2150 now in support of that small increase for calorie intake two tests ago lymphocysts that were less than 1600 earlier this year and closer to that 2000 average level that's found in youth and for blood test data that came in from october 25th which is not included in this plot lymy levels were 1877 which again is closer to 2,000 than it is to the less than 1600 so for now i'm going to stay at 2150 for the small potential increase in lymphocytes and note that that small increase in calories didn't mess up these other biomarkers that are on the right so using a data driven approach to try to figure out what might be optimal for calorie intake with the goal of improving lipocytes and improving the rdw with the goal of longevity all right that's all for now if you're
