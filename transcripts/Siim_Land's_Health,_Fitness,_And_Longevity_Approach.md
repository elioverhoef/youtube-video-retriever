## Transcript

Today we've got seam land whose new book the longevity leap is a deep dive into the science of longevity and how we can add healthy years to our lifespan so with that we're going to do a deep dive into seam his backstory and then as much as we can cover in the book so welcome scene yeah my pleasure and i'm happy to be here cool so there aren't that many interviews of you on uh on youtube or at least i didn't see very many so i think it's important that we go back and look at the you know the evolution of the process because where you started on youtube is almost a completely different place although in this health and fitness uh sphere so but i want to go even further back so uh as a kid active into health and fitness so what are your earliest memories of uh being into the active and fitness lifestyle yeah so uh my earliest memories probably have to do with in terms of fitness have to do with doing push-ups with my dad when we were kids something like four or five years old like in the evening we would do like a push-up contest of how many push-ups we could do and like we were amazed wow my dad can do like a bunch of push-ups so that was like my earliest introduction of hey i want to be kind of strong as well i want to do you know different kind of calisthenic exercises and be strong and healthy i you know as a child i was growing up in the countryside so i was always doing something like physical most of playing outside and playing soccer with my brother or um we also did like this um you know medieval battles with each other we like fight each other with sticks and swords uh that kind of thing u climbing trees uh of course we did some like uh physical labor as well like carrying some stones or um doing hay like we spent our summers in our great aunts place that uh where you do the hay traditional way where you like rake the hay you throw it in the bar you stump it so it's kind of the old school method and yeah also just doing pull-ups on the tree on a branch when i was like i guess something like eight or nine years old i remember you know in the evening again like trying to do like a few sets of pull-ups and uh yeah i mean those were the kind of early days of me trying exercise i wasn't particularly like at least with cardio or stuff i wasn't like very athletic i think i think i was in a good condition and fitness with calisthenics i was in school i was like the best in calisthenics out of my class but not for cardio so yeah i was always kind of mediocre with cardiovascular exercise and uh yeah in high school got into more like strength training and uh yeah since then i you know as an adult started to learn more about all the different topics uh primarily in the beginning learning about yeah how to build muscle and and lose fat through like a gym perspective and gradually yeah learning more about different aspects of health and lery as well all wait so were there specific people besides your dad who uh you kind of had as fitness role models when you were a kid or a teenager um yeah like um i guess yeah my dad was a role model for the kind of calisthenic side but overall like fitness i didn't have like you know any particular role models be besides that um you know i did play soccer a little bit but i wasn't yet like into like sports in that sense u so i was kind of self i just my main motivation was to just yeah kind of i i thought it was just you know something that you would want to do as a good human being to like get get strong and um be kind of athletic so it's this kind of the socr is quote it goes something along the lines that uh it it would be a shame for you for you to go grow old without knowing what your body is capable so yeah i think that was maybe one of the quotes as well that has kind of kept me motivated as like a teenager so it was the idea of fitness not necessarily seeing people who were fit and while you were a young age saying i want to emulate that path like even sports athletes like soccer players there weren't any soccer players that you saw and you were like wow i want to be fit and you know i want to be fit like that person so i don't think so like you know of course i did watch soccer as a child you know the world cup or the eu cup so like ronaldo and luis figo or those like uh zidan like these old school soccer players back then so of course they were like inspirational like you were as a kid yeah like i had a ronaldo shirt and stuff like that but i never like you know saw them as like role models for fitness like uh you know i was just hey i want to play good i want to play soccer well but i was never like like interested in it as a you know even not even a career thing or anything that not to mention the kind of a health and fitness component interesting so how about now are there people in their you know 70s 80s 90s i see you posting like bodybuilder pictures on uh x and you're like oh this is kind of like the standard of what we can be at 70 and 80 years old are there people that stand out that that uh yeah like you know i post yeah this different kind of videos or clips of um older people who who are in great physical condition and good health you have like these uh 90-year-old gymnasts and 90-year-old rowing champions as and like pole vating champions so yeah of course now being into ler is uh those people would be like role models of okay when i am you know in a few decades this is what i would like to like emulate in in a sense um but younger people like yeah i don't i don't think i look in towards my peers or like inspiration in that sense like i'm kind of past the phase of trying to like uh do bodybuilding as like aesthetic thing like i did it early in my early 20s um kind of past that phase currently i'm mostly interested in like you know of course maintaining decent physique because it's a good sign of like health and good body composition but that's uh pretty much uh it maybe like i don't know i don't have any specific names that kind of come to mind and the most inspirational or in like impressive of these people you know don't have any like social media or something they're this kind of random grandpa grandpa in china that does does like pull-ups at 90 years old yeah i have many which you know so it's almost a completely different path i mean like schwarzenegger when i was a kid schwarzenegger was like big and huge and then there were other people clarence bass john taylor some of these have di some of these people have died but uh yeah you get to a certain point where it's not about emulating anymore and then it's it's almost like people are emul emulating you because you meet or you get to know those people and it's not as impressive as you thought and then you think wow i can do better right so so do you have do you have aspirations where you'll be that 70 80 90 year old plus still lean and ripped avoided all age related decline you know do you have aspirations is that part of the plan yeah well like i definitely don't plan to stop taking care of my health and stop uh exercising so i think it's going to be just a natural byproduct of staying consistent with um good diet and good exercise for the next few decades so i don't think it's you know these people don't they're not like particularly like um let's say unique in that sense theyve just you know implemented exercise and they've stayed consistent with it for decades and a lot of them don't even exercise before the age of something like 70 and then they start so uh yeah i think it kind of go goes goes down comes down to um staying consistent with it so i definitely you know i don't i'm not going to try to like you know a lot of these people like do like marathons and and those kind of things like compete in this like 100 year old sports events like i don't have any like desire to do that like you know i think it would be cool yeah like to be the world record holder for some sort of a sprint event like 400 meter dash or something like that but um i'm not like you know super drawn to that so i guess yeah like i don't need any like achievement besides just working on my own like health and eno to when i'm like older so i hear that but i also have some doubt because so it's just naturally competitive right if you see brian has a speed of aging at whatever it is 66 right there's got to be some small amount you know of you that's like well i can beat that right so now fast forward and then you see people in whether it's my generation or even your generation maybe a generation older than me like dave like dave pasco right so if some of those of that those generations start to actually compete in some of these masters competitions and there's got to be a part of you that's like i can do i can do that right and then before you know what this plan is the yeah we'll see like uh but i'm not like doing that for that reason so if i if i have you know reached 100 years of age or even like 80 or 90 then but yeah i mean like the older you get the less competition there is so if you're like 110 year old sprinter then there's probably no one else out there to compete with you so you instantly like win so the the actual competition is like you know kind of staying uh alive for longer definitely definitely all right so you your evolution in this field i mean i think you started off in the keto crowd in very low carb and then so how did you and especially when you started making youtube videos i think that was about seven years ago uh you started mostly on that journey and and with autofy and met talking about metabolic flexibility so like what was your what was your thought process at that time and then how is it the same or how has it changed since then yeah like my first videos was yeah in like 2016 so very like all up there like eight years ago but it was like very small in the beginning and the first videos were about actually something like personal development and that kind of thing like that was what what i was into so i wasn't like into diets or longevity back then and uh the first videos were about like like i did like the seven habits of highly effective people and stoicism and those kind of videos and uh then i started to make a little bit about nutrition and exercise as well so this kind of yeah more like maybe like a tim feris approach that that you talk about productivity also talk about diet and blood work and those kind of things and yeah like back then i was doing you know mostly inter fasting was the first thing that i did so i did like 16 and8 one m a day warrior diet and different kinds of fasting and uh that gained a little bit more traction those videos i also experimented with like a ketogenic diet for a few years and i did make videos about that as well then uh i guess i you know the reason i did a kido that was i wanted to kind of you try it out i heard some things about it wanted to experiment with it shared shared my experience as well as shared like content about it so back then there was not a lot it's very new like a lot not a lot of people were actually talking about at these topics so they got just gained attraction into youtube like search engine so that's where i kind of grew my first audience maybe like 1,000 people or something and then it kind of grew from there doing a mix of content about keto doing a mix of content about innovative fting andag and those things so um yeah but you know eventually i kind of uh changed my diet you know introduced more carbohydrates doing different types of carbohydrate cycling etc i mean i've always just been like experimenting with the different diets and the different ways of eating and my content has been yeah like about uh that you know it hasn't been like a journey that i'm doing like some sort of vlogs my videos have always been somewhat like educational so i pick a certain topic you know how to increase aagy and then then i make a video about it then it kind of gains popularity because no one else is really talking about it so back in 2018 like no one was talking about mtor and aag like i was one of the first on to actually like like create i guess like a spot on the algorithm with that those kind of keywords and uh yeah i was kind of early early in that in that space so so then you experimented with keto and playing with carbohydrates i'm guessing you played around with protein intake uh so how did how is that journey evolved like what works best how what you know strengths and weaknesses uh independent of blood blood testing like just right because you obviously you you changed from the keto to the higher carbs uh without i don't know if that was a blood test based thing or what was the mindset in in changing it up yeah well before keto i was high carb so like when i was 18 years old up to like 20 years old i was i was you know eating a higher carb diet and then i switched keto for a few days and then i switched back so the reason i uh switched back was because let's be honest like my the biggest motivating factor was like strength training so eating more carbs just makes me stronger and i build more muscle more easily and i al also noticed that um my like fat loss is also easier like actually become leaner if i at more carbohydrates and yeah my metabolic rate is higher and those kind of things so it was just you know i'm going to try this thing uh low caro for a little bit and even during that time i was doing some aspects of carb cycling so it was never like completely strict keto it was actually more like a low carb diet so didn't meet the actual keto specifications of of getting less than 50 grams of carbs per day so i was always eating something like 100 grams or something that uh plus some aspects of carb cycling and then i went back to it because yeah i wanted to maximize my like potential for muscle strength and muscle growth so yeah i wasn't like reaching that with like a low carb diet and yeah before and it kind of the reason i made it change was that i remembered you know okay before k i was doing the high carb version and it was working great so like why change it i'll go back to it uh in terms of blood work then i mean there are some like just simple expectations or like a clear expectations that you can expect from changing the diet you if you're on low car keto version diet your cholesterol typic is going to be higher your blood sugar might be slightly lower and maybe triglycerides are slightly lower and on a lower fat lower saturated fat higher carb diet your cholesterol is typically lower uh my blood sugar is pretty much the same and my triglycerides are also like pretty much the same so it also made sense from um like rational perspective of okay it's kind of better for my blood work as as like a whole but only on a small segment because i find that a lot in maketo crow only focus on metabolic health which is what you mentioned glucose and lipids so uh at some point i don't know have you done the experiment well i guess we can go through we can take a deeper dive into diet right so um have you done any experimentation with you know the keto even at 100 grams of carbs per day versus the higher carb and when you say higher carb just to you know illustrate for people who who may not be familiar i'm i'm guessing this is probably whole food based this isn't like season cakes because i think when most people hear high carb it's like oh you're eating donuts and and ice cream right yeah so have you done any experimentation comparing the you know 100 grams per day or less versus the relatively higher carb and then effects on biomarkers besides metabolic health kidney liver inflammation yeah i mean like i did track my blood workers not as like regularly back in the day when i was doing keto uh compared to now and uh you know i mean i i didn't have any like other real changes to my blood work except for the cholesterol like like my metabolic health is very good right now it was pretty much like or my inci sensitivity was uh also like very similar to what it was uh what it is right now so there was no like change it didn't worsen like my glucose or insulin levels going from yeah like 100 gram carbs to now something like 200 to 300 gram carbs per day so yeah so about the same no change you can you can basically thrive right now on any diet metabolically flexible yeah and i think that the biggest thing is that you know i exercise and i also maintain like a good body fat percentage year round so you know any diet you can um see improvements if you just lose a little bit weight and you you know exercise regularly and vice versa like any diet you can see worse results you can see blood markers getting worse if you're gaining weight and you're being sedentary so yeah i think you know my personal belief about diet is that yeah a lot of people you know get very defensive about diet but the truth is that it only moves the needle you know a little bit it's not usually the biggest determining factor of course there are some yeah minor or individual biomarkers that tend to change but like the all of them work in the context of the calorie intake and your like body fed percentage so if you're eating a keto di but you're overweight then uh you know your insulin sensitivity is still going to be bad and then the same with the high carbon you know you could eat a bunch of carbs and your incident could be very low and your blood sugar could be very low or normal uh because you're not overeating and you're exercising at the same time so yeah i think many people you know just focus on the diet but they're not focusing on the blood markers so the blood markers at the end of the day are what actually you know mediate any potential risk from what you're eating and uh what actually drive these chronic diseases that end up killing people so let's assume yeah i agree 100% so let's assume you've got the those two diets right lower carb keto-ish you know 100 grams 50 grams whatever or and then the relatively higher carb right so and again not 80% carbs you know even something more reasonable 40ish percent you know 50% somewhere in that ballpark right so what you think about short-term versus long-term potential effects where right now in your case you're metabolically flexible your blood data blood blood biomarker data is basically about the same on both diets but you know in order to properly test which diet may be optimal you need a a twin a genetically identical twin and you're on your diet and he's on uh their you know on the other diet right so who would and assuming all the other factors are the same you know sleep uh exercise intensity duration frequency all that right you'd have to fast forward 20 30 50 years to see all right which was truly best based on genetic background and there's just no way to know right now right so what are your thoughts on although metabolically flexible right now and biomarkers most the same right now could there be a time when you know maybe when you're 50 or 60 or i don't know 40 whatever the case may be now the biomarkers start to look a little bit off and now you've got to maybe make some changes to whether it's diet or supplements uh even changing maybe the exercise up uh to try to move the needle back towards a more youthful state yeah like of course you know i'm not married to any particular diet like you know i can eat many different foods i kind of i'm not like yeah super like this foodie person like i can eat beans i can eat eggs i can eat sweet potatoes i can eat rice uh vegetables fish meat so yeah like uh i'm not like a huge food fan in that sense uh so uh yeah of course i will i would always like adjust my food and the macros etc based on you know what my health is currently and also like my goals for the moment and and what i'm doing so yeah if i'm not exercising that much much um generally reducing my carbohydr intake but uh yeah if if we we don't have yet like the perfect experiment where you know you have the twin doing the opposite diet for two decades but you know at least you know based on observational data then there's no nothing that would indicate that a carbohydrate intake of something like 40 to 50% would increase your mortality that's actually typically linked to the lowest risk uh so yeah like if you're eating a lot of carbs 80% of the calories is carbs then that probably is not the best solution but there's nothing that would indicate that moderate carb intake would be somehow harmful either and yeah i mean japanese people eat rice mediterranean people eat pasta and stuff so uh yeah i think uh a lot of people might be afraid of carbs because of you know in the in the past few decades ago everyone was afraid of fact but i think that like the pendulum has shifted that now we everyone is afraid of carbs but uh whole food carbs um aren't aren't really like bad in my opinion yeah it doesn't necessarily have to be carbohydrate it could be anything it could be you know do you need more omega 6 now not omega 6 omega-3 do you need more you know certain types of protein and less of other types of protein you know just uh yeah i think people there's so many in this space that are married to the ideology of it and even like you know without thinking of the broader context rather than as you said what did the biomarker show and then how can i use whether it's diet supplements exercise you know sleep whatever you know to try to move move the needle right so yeah yeah and your omega 3 like yeah if you have a biomarker that connects with some foods or some macros then yeah that's a very good thing to keep track off so like omega-3s are the best example you have a specific biomarker omega-3 index that actually reflects your omega-3 status in red red blood cells so uh you know that you can use that to gauge okay are you getting of omega-3s and you know vice versa with some other like lipids and glucose markers etc certain foods affect those markers so you can adjust your food intake based on okay is your some of these markers getting out of out of range so i would add one caveat to that that's one half of the equation right so you'd expect that an increase in dietary intake for omega-3 should increase you know whether it's red blood cell or plasma levels of epa and dha but if they're not knowing that inflammation increases during aging and inflammation is a driver of degradation for epa and dha just as one example they can be metabolized into all sorts of other metabolites uh if your omega-3 intake is high but blood levels are low then that suggests that it's not a problem that can be fixed solely from more intake of omega-3 like that's a the an a good example of that too is like torine so i don't specifically supplement with torine and uh you know i do eat fish but um you know when i make a torine video people are all over the comments talking about how i supplement with toine but that's only one half the equation it can be degraded and metabolized into other stuff and unfortunately most people aren't measuring that stuff right so um yeah only focusing on the one one half i think the dietary intake side got to look at the bottle markers right so another so let's dig down into details like how carefully do you pay attention to diet or maybe not at all right now or it's just a m or even calories do you do you track any of that stuff uh or it's just eat you know eat as much as you want and just exercise so what's your like in terms of the diet prescription in your case uh how can we define that yeah like i don't count calories i don't like weigh my foods i don't count the macros either i'm mostly looking at yeah my body composition and body fatness so i eat until i'm full and uh on some days i'll eat more on some other days i'll eat less and if i see that okay i'm starting to gain a bit too much body fat then i'll just you know for a few days or a week or something i'll eat less and vice versa if i'm getting too lean getting too skinny or getting too weak at a gym or something feeling tired then i'll increase the calorie intake so uh yeah i think you know the problem is yeah like uh even if there were so like there's no way to know that okay this optimal split of this percentage of protein this percentage of carbs this percentage of fats uh there's no way to know that uh that will be optimal for every day for the rest of your life kind of uh so uh much rather yeah i tend to just look at like the blood markers and the body composition and seeing uh okay is my muscle mass decreasing then uh you know i need to probably make sure that i get enough protein and ensure like that i do resistance raining regularly and the same with like blood markers as well that okay i might be eating too many fats or carbs or prot or what whatever the case may be so yeah i track anything i kind of eat to satiety i do like prioritize protein in my meals and uh you know i have you know for some days you maybe every few months or so i'll track protein and maybe track calories as well and then i'll see okay this is approximately how much my average meal has the approximate amount of fats and proteins and calories so for the rest of them a few months i'm just going to like follow that kind of a similar pattern and then it's going to fluctuate obviously every day plus in minus five to 10% so how would you break it down like protein carbs fat fiber uh based on those you know times you do track yeah so like um my average protein intake is something i've been reducing my protein intake slightly over the last year before that i was consuming at least 150 gram of protein and nowadays i'm eating like 130 maybe 40 grams of protein on average per day my total calories on average are something like again depends if i'm trying to lose weight or kind of uh bulk up a little bit but on average is something something between 2,000 to 2500 and maybe on some days it goes up to 2,800 if uh yeah i add like like a bit more olive oil or or something like that carbohydrate intake is on average yeah 200 to 300 gram fat intake would be something like 70 80 gram maybe even 100 gram on some cases but yeah i don't i'm not on like a lowfat diet but i'm not like on a super high fat diet either and fiber you know i don't count fiber specifically but all the carbohydrates come from you know fruits vegetables ies tubers some these whole grains so yeah i'll be probably getting something like 40 gr of fiber in my opinion nuts no nut seeds or i have like a few um so in the morning uh my first meal of the day is like a protein shake or even like a you can call it like a smoothie or like ice cream type thing i put a protein powder and i blend it with frozen berries it becomes like somewhat thicker and with that i'll have like a handful of walnuts so maybe five six walnuts or some on some other cases it might be brazil nuts or almonds maybe not almonds that not not that much but the walnuts are kind of i think one of the healthiest ones all right sweet so since we're on that so then that's the first meal then second how many meals per day how are you what's what's the general day of eating look like yeah i'll have the protein uh smoothie or protein shake at 10:00 a.m. And uh i'll wait around maybe two hours 3 hours i'll go to the gym or go for a run depends what day it is and after that i'll wait maybe 2 hours you know cool down go to the sona and i'll have a dinner right now i've been having dinner at 4 p.m. Uh in the past it might up been at 5:00 p p.m. But i've been reducing it to 4 p.m. I tend to like find it that it's better for sleep um and that meal is usually yeah like as a carbohydrate source it's either sweet potatoes or buckwheat maybe some rice not that often but occasionally and uh some sort of uh vegetables like broccoli cauliflower peas carrots steamed usually may some in some cases i'll have like beans like black beans or kiny beans with a protein source it would be something like fish i haven't been eating that much meat recently but uh i'll have it like a few times a week and um or some eggs maybe two three eggs so i'll be getting yeah something like 90 grams of protein probably from the second meal and from the first meal i'm getting 30 gram 35 gram something like that u and as a as a last last meal of the day after the the main course i'll have have some either some coris cheese or some greek yogurt with some you know berries or nuts or something like that at what time at what time is that and that's pretty much immediately after the the the meal so it's some somewhere around 500 p p.m. And then that's it no more eating until what time is bedtime i'll go to bed usually between 9:30 and 10:30 so then you're up at what time i'm up at uh between 6 and 7 so no eating for the first three hours as soon as you wake up uh no yeah and that's on purpose or why why what's the rationale yeah i mean i've been doing this way of eating for six years or something that uh you know i've always liked in fasting it's always felt easy and kind of uh effortless so uh yeah breakfast for me just kind of feels like a bit of um like slow not not slows me down but it's just kind of a time sync you have to like make something so i'll much rather like have something quick takes me like two minutes to make that protein shake dr drink and then i'll be you know doing work or something else during those hours so i'll you know i'll spend only 30 minutes of the day actually preparing the meal or even even less like 20 minutes so it sounds like when you're up between 6:00 and 700 you don't want to eat because it gets in the way and it slows you down so then you're you're just getting work done like as soon as you wake up the wheels start turning and you're just getting work done for the next three four hours and then it's like all right i'll take a break and and eat the drink the smoothie yeah like i just like to work in in the morning so um writing researching uh something about content and those kind of things emails so uh yeah that's what i'll do in the immediately after waking up so i yep yeah have tea or coffee maybe i drink uh some mineral water but uh yeah i mean i'm not really hungry even within those hours so i don't d like feel the need to have anything so all wait what kind of tea black green other kinds of tea what what kind of tea i like green tea so it's i've always liked the green tea um sometimes it might be also this uh chamomile tea or there's one of these like spicy teas as well that i've liked has like cardamone and those kind of things some sort of indian spice tea so that that eating pattern and that uh those you know foods is it consistent from day to day i mean i know that you course correct based on you know strength and and how you look and all that but is the overall the stuff that you're including in a diet pretty consistent dayto day week to week yeah like yeah like i said i've been following this meal timing pattern for yes six years and uh during that time window i have like you know changed some of the foods i've eaten more meat basted i've eaten more car-based etc so uh those decisions come mostly from me like blood work decisions gotcha all right so a big part of that approach though is satiety right because you know it's hard for most people you say you eat until you're full but for someone like me i'm a volume eater i that could go six seven 8,000 calories so you know on 2,000 200 calories you've got to be satiated right otherwise it's very easy to eat just a couple hundred calories over and then before you know it you've got more body fat and then you've got a course correct and it's this vicious loop so i'm guessing that on your approach satiety is like almost 100% where you almost never want to stray from it and then if you do i don't know do you include cheat meals or cheat days or junk or some desserts how often do you do that like what's your thinking around that yeah i'm like pretty much always satiated like i don't remember really like a time where i was like oh i'm going to super craving for something of that or i'm super like ravenous um you know of course i might get hungry every once in a while um but uh nothing like yeah super ravenous and i'm always kind of satiated after meals so it might be something something to do with i don't know microbiome or something like that i don't know but uh yeah like i do have some like quote unquote cheat meals or something that the most common one is just like some ice cream i'll have like some of these uh sugar-free ice cream like halo top or nyx or something like that that's very low in calories and uh tastes like regular ice cream i might have some regular ice cream as well sometimes that has like some sugars so i'm not like super like strict about my diet it's just most of the time i'll end up eating the same old the same old that i typically eat and uh yeah i mean i haven't noticed that uh having certain of these cheat meals or something would uh worsen my blood markers so might be because i'm exercising a lot but even then like i like to joke that you know all the centenarians if you look at them they all eat ice cream that's kind of an interesting pattern that all the 100 year olds they're like oh i have ice cream every night so i i do think that ice cream is pretty healthy uh or it's like at least the healthiest type of uh dessert one of the healthier ones especially if you have like less sugar but that's a potentially double-edged sword right because then if it's at every meal and you're not satiated because it's not a whole food it's pretty processed then it's like all right i want to eat this all the time and then it's hard to stay on track so how what's the frequency of you know or it's just feel it's like i feel like eating a little bit today but then what's the frequency for the next cheat meal how what what's that general routine look like once every three days every day once a week right well i think depends on the person like you know some people they can have yeah like literally one scoop or like one one some sort of a small cup of ice cream and just ignore it or they can like have one square of chocolate and and then they'll be fine with it whereas others yeah like i'm going to eat the entire box of donuts so you people need to like know which kind of a satiety profile they are i personally i i've uh been both in the past or like i've i've been in periods where i'm able to just take one bite and ignore it whereas in other periods of yeah like i'm going to eat the entire box and and uh that's it but i think yeah like currently like i don't i don't feel like like i'm so sort of like super craving for for these kind of things um i do have maybe like twice a week or something i'll have like some ice cream but it's usually like i have either one of these cones is what you call or like a small cup so you know yeah i don't think i guess the the dose is what really matters yeah like of course if you so what i like to say is like okay if you eat one potato chip every day for the rest of your life you know chances are it's not it's going to have like any it's not going to have any significant effect on your uh longevity if you eat 100 potato chips every day for the rest of your life then it's very likely that you'll be more overweight and with slightly worse blood markers and you'll probably like die sooner so okay what how where's the sweet spot between zero or between one and 100 so it's probably you know depends on the person some people it's five 10 some people it's 25 i don't know like you know maybe yeah like over 30 it's probably going to be too much so yeah it's always the matter is always in the dose and uh for weight loss and body composition then the calorie intake is still the most important important factor that determines weight loss or weight gain so you know i've experimented it with myself as well that i can lose weight and gain weight as well on both a low carb and a high carb diet so the macro ratios are secondary to the actual calorie intake and the health effects are secondary to the body composition changes so your body composition will worsen first before your blood markers will uh worsen in my opinion so they if you're starting to gain weight then you're you can be pretty assure that your blood markers will also like worsen but if you're lean and uh you're not overeating calories you're not gaining weight then it's very it's less likely that your blood markers will also also worsen so you have you know i don't know what the percentage would be so i would suggest that maybe like five to 10% you can get away with like less optimal foods and how big is it is it more on the side of five or is it more on the side of 10 depends depends on the the person and their you know fitness and uh age and metabolic health so i i agree 100% that calories are the essential it's it's probably the biggest part of the equation and then balancing out how much junk to enable you to be able to stick to you know the the lower calories and be lean and have you know almost no visceral fat rack that's the huge the maybe the biggest part of all of it right but uh you know there's there may be some nuance because what if you've got a pro athlete who's eating nothing but pizza and ice cream and and literally has no other nutrition so you might you know their performance may be good and they're satiated and they can just burn it off but are they getting the nutrients that they need to optimize kidney function and you know inflammation and all of the things right so and you may not see it if they're not measuring it right so um for sure i think it's more than just the calories you got you know obviously you got to pay attention to the to the biomarkers so but it sounds like it sounds like you don't have any issues with this at all where it's your you know it's just course correct don't have to track it you know um which is like a gift in some ways right because i think most people can't do that right more people than ever are overweight or obese and they're probably not tracking so it's it's an incredible challenge and and difficult for most people to have optimal body composition just kind of winging it you know what i mean so yeah yeah for sure like you know i have done the hard work many years ago like 10 years ago i was tracking calories and macros so i did it for a few months and uh you know you learn a lot about it you learn actually how much certain foods have in terms of the macros and the calories and you like you know develop the skill of okay this meal approximately has this much and eventually you're not going to even think about that but you know the kind of steps should be that in the beginning you track everything you weigh everything then eventually you wean off from it slightly you'll be kind of eyeballing it you know in your head or in some sort of a calorie tracker you'll you know look at the food put it in the tracker you'll see the numbers and try to stick to those uh within those ranges but you're not like weighing it and then the next step is yeah like you're kind of being somewhat mindful and conscious about it but again you're not even tracking it um and the final step is yeah like you eat whatever you want kind of and uh intuitively or habitually just uh stay in the uh optimal intake or like a kind of decent intake with uh with the calories and macros yeah that's what works for you right so yeah i've tried that approach it doesn't work i actually i have to physically track everything you know uh and even just eyeballing it's not you know but i'm it's you got to find what works for you right that's the bottom line so all right so you mentioned you you cut protein by 20 grams why why the protein cut i think uh the biggest reason was that um based on the research it's you need much less than you think so uh the one 50 60 grams that i was aiming for i think uh let me just quickly calculate my weight in the pounds what's your what's your body weight in kilograms that's 77 right now so so that's 169 pounds so uh a lot of the research or a lot of people say that okay aim for this one gram per pound of body weight which for me would have been something like 170 or 165 grams of protein but uh the research shows that you get the maximum benefits from muscle growth or they peak at 1 point or at 0.8 grams per pound or 1.6 gram per kilogram so you need actually much less for maximum muscle growth than a lot of people suggest so i felt that okay i don't need to eat that much protein so there's no reason for me to do that so i'm just going to reduce it to uh this 130 40 g which would be that 0.8 eight g per pound for me so yeah and i didn't notice any like loss in performance or loss in muscle mider actually did the dexa scan some in the when i was eating the more protein and in july i did the second one when i had been eating less protein and i actually gained 0.2 kilograms in the appendicular muscle mass index so like the muscle in the arms and legs so actually i gain muscle eating less protein and actually while at the same time having lost like 5% body fat as well which uh you know is is actually the best result that could be that you lose body fat then you build a small amount of muscle tissue so yeah i think many people overemphasize the idea of protein you need much less than you think yes you want to get something like 0.7 to 0.8 grams per pound of body weight for protein every day but that already maximizes the muscle growth benefits and if you eat like one gram per pound then it's kind of overkill if you're very overweight then i would like suggest that yeah a much higher protein like that so something like one gram per pound would be more optimal because first of all protein is very satiating so if you're overate you want to promote satiety and yeah protein makes you eat less overall and you also burn a lot of calories digesting protein so if you're eating something like 200 gram of protein then a lot of it goes to digestion and you waste it for uh and you waste waste that energy so you're not storing that so yeah but if you're leaner and more physically active than then from my own experience then you need much less than you think yeah so there's another variable in that equation which is uh blood ura nitrogen so you know it seems like that's the hot topic on you know eat more protein and that may be true for some older adults who barely struggle to even get 08 grams per kilogram right making sure they get at least that minimum may be important but once we get into like you know uh 150 172 gram per kilogram or more so if blood urine nitrogen is high assuming normal kidney function so you know protein has nitrogen so if you're not using it the the body is going to deaminate take off the nitrogen groups and form ura so that may not seem like a big deal but ura increases during aging in part because kidney function declines during aging right so that may not seem like a big deal but ura can degrade so if ura is circulating elevated levels of ura are circulating the gut is uh you know it has vasculature so it receives that blood supply ura can degrade the tight junctions in the intestine so which means that more stuff from the lumen can leak into the blood now you've got stuff that activates inflammation so i'm not saying very high protein diets will be bad for uh inflammation i'm not it depends on the individual it depends on what your data shows if someone's eating two grams of protein per kilogram or more and the blood ur nitrogen is relatively eful at 12 13 14 not a problem but bun increases during aging so you know this whole drive of eat more protein eat more protein you know uh for the people who are having a hard time getting enough i think it's important but like you said it's most people get more or most active minded people as long as they're getting that 1.6 how much above that is very debatable and i'd argue there are a lot of mechanisms that uh yeah may not be good yeah for sure like why take the risk if uh there's no benefit so uh that's what i like to think a lot that you know high protein usually don't like cause g disease in otherwise healthy people but you don't know what it might do to your so if you eat yeah like a two two grams per pound for decades you know are your are your kidneys going to be suboptimal once you're 80 or 90 years old so like do not take that risk then okay eat just just that much as is needed and uh not not more more than that i wasn't presuming that the very high protein intakes cause kidney disease there be many factors there but knowing that kidney function declines during aging and any excess that your body doesn't need for the protein you know it's going to be deaminated and forming ura and knowing that elevated blood levels of ura in you know potentially either in conjunction with po poor kidney function leading to the elevated ura that degradation of the uh tight junctions you know it's a potential disaster you know ie too much protein being a disaster for you know systemic health there's another there's another side of this equation too which is um gastric output so stomach acid production and uh pepsin levels can decline during aging and i say can because some some studies show a decline other other other studies don't show a decline and that's potentially important because if you can't digest and absorb that protein in the small intestine so we get the protein in the blood and you know get you know uh protein muscle protein synthesis and all the things that protein is good for more of it will reach the colon where it's fermented by gut bacteria to produce quote unquote deleterious metabolites that can indeed impact not just kidney function but the heart the vasculature the brain so uh but most people aren't measuring these things right so they just think oh i'm eating a very high protein diet i'm good but what did the biomarkers show right so yeah yeah interestingly i think with plant-based proteins you don't see those negative effects that often as with animal based proteins that uh this protein fermentation as well is less likely to happen with the the plant proteins so yeah like if you're eating higher amount of plant proteins then that appears to be safer whereas a higher amount of animal protein typically uh tends to be worse in the studies at least yeah yeah yeah 100% agree the only caveat is like as you know egg and meat they're they're what is it the biological activity or their ability to doce muscle muscle protein synthesis is higher than plant protein right so now you got balance between you want to keep the protein away from the fermentation by the gut but now you know it's like how much meat how much animal products versus how much plant-based protein like there's that b nobody's thinking about this it's just eat more protein but yeah these are all variables in the equation yeah and you know if you are eating animal-based proteins then you need actually much less so you wouldn't so you wouldn't need like one gram per pound of animal protein if you're eating 100% animal protein then you could probably get the same effect from just yeah 0.7 grams per pound but if you are eating plant-based proteins then you need a little bit more like 20 to 30% more so if you're eating plant-based proteins then you might need yeah like up to one gram per pound for the maximum protein synthesis effects yeah makes sense all right so exercise right so how often for how long uh how do you decide which days uh what's your what are your thoughts on the uh optimal duration for you like i know the published studies and and it's you know most of it you know it's in the book or almost all of it's in the book i mean you know 8,000 references i i can't imagine how you left any stone unturned uh but um outside of the published studies like you know that people can get in the book the seam the seam workout plan how how did you settle on where you currently are and what are your thoughts for frequency duration all that yeah so i've uh yeah changed my workout plan quite drastically over the last three two years something like that uh in the past pass you know between the ages of 18 and 28 i was pretty much doing only strength training with walking i was uh yeah at the gym or you know at doing calisthenics whatever maybe four to five times a week resistance raining and but yeah like uh based on the research which is which is why i changed some of my workout plan then uh you know doing like an even split of cardio and resistance training appears to be better for long-term health so uh right now i'm doing resistance training three times a week and i follow like a push pull leg split so i work out day one number one i'll do pushing muscles so let's say bench press shoulder press uh workout day number two i'll do leg muscles so squats maybe this stiff leg deadlifts and workout day number three i'll do pulling muscles so uh pull-ups or these rows barbell rows or or defts as well so yeah this covers the entire body and uh i think that's you know for me at least that's the kind of optimal amount of resistance training that i found while at the same time also doing cardiovascular exercise so yeah if i was to work out six times a week with weights then it would be maybe somewhat of a different protocol but i've always kind of followed this idea that cycle between the main muscle groups um and uh i like to do the main compound lifts because it's the most most kind of time efficient way to exercise or to lift weights and it's also like more functional so you're you know i'm targeting more strength so i i wasn't like really interested in muscle mass like a bodybuilder i've wanted to be more like stronger so like a more power lifting um approach and with that by focusing on strength you also build plenty of muscle mass so it's kind of you get both the best of both worlds and uh yeah the compound exercises the multi-joint exercises like bench uh deadlift squat rows they're just like the best fit in my experience uh for that overhead press yeah i like that a lot so and this is was like the first workout plan that i did when i was 18 years old 17 years old um this 5x5 strong lifts program which uh you know has their own like exercises but it's also the main just compound lifts so you don't need to do like dozens of different exercises with machines if you just do the bench press you're targeting your tri bps your front delts and your chest etc with the rows your targeting ls your forearms and biceps etc so yeah i it just takes me like 30 to 45 minutes at the gym and i'm pretty much done with that so i don't spend like a lot of hours at the gym uh maybe four years ago i did went go through i did go through like a mini kind of like um bulking arc where i was trying to build more mess and uh during that time i did like longer workouts so i was doing maybe 1 hour maybe even like a one and a half hour at some time and uh but that involved still the main compound lifts but i was doing a lot of the accessory exercises as well for the hypertrophy but uh nowadays when i'm not focusing that much on the muscle mass and just focusing on strength and uh bone density for example then i do yeah like two exercises pretty much you know in a given workout 45 minutes and uh that's pretty much it then with cardio so i'm doing u currently for the last month i've been taking a break from cardio just to kind of yeah take a break from it uh but before that over the last year i've been doing uh two to three zone two cardio workouts per week uh which last 55 minutes on average and uh the intensity is somewhat low so it's not anything strenuous it's kind of like a you know easy jog so i'm always like breathing through the nose i'm not getting exhausted from it i could do it for like two three hours in a row um so uh yeah it's it's been my main focus over the last year to build like this cardiovascular um base and then once a week i'll do like a hit workout as well some interval training now the hit to workout kind of varies i might do it once a week or i might might also do it like once every other other week so it's not like um staple in my program because i'm already like you excise exercising quite a lot so if i yeah feel that okay i've been you know being too or i've been exercising too much already then i'll just skip it but if i do it then i might replace one of the zone two cardio workouts with the hit program and then usually i'll have one day of the week where i you know don't do any exercise so i might might just go for a walk or something like that and the hit program the hit workout kind of fluctuates as well but i'll typically do something like four intervals each interval lasting somewhere between two to four minutes and uh i i like do like a rest interval or like a slow jog for example like two to four minutes in between those uh rounds so i'll repeat it for four rounds and yeah that's pretty much it for the interval wait so the the your hit training you're doing two to four minutes all out sprint like just hard run as hard as you can for those two to four minutes and then it's uh two to four minutes of slow jog yeah like so when you're not able to like go all out for in the entire two to four minutes because uh you know you're only able to sprint for you know less than 30 seconds usually so it's it's like just a moderate pace and i'm aiming for this uh 80 to 90% of my max heart rate so i usually wear this polar heart rate monitor during the cardio sessions and i'm tracking my heart rate so i'm aiming for the 80 to 90% of my max heart rate for those two to four minutes and in the rest intervals i'm uh reducing the heart rate to something like 50 to 60% max heart rate and then i'll repeat it so you're purposely training uh trying to train the 80 to 90% heart rate zone by doing it for that long because you could do it i'm guessing you get to 80 to 90% within 30 seconds or less right and then could just right so you're literally trying to train that as much as you can yeah yeah and uh it's also like a good metric because it can change so to say like you get fitter and then you can increase but you always like try to like you can also use like your rate of perceived exertion kind of so like 80 80 to 90% of your rate of perceived exertion so like 100% is that yeah like you're all out sprinting and you're kind of almost falling down and 80 to 90% of that so you can pace yourself according to that if you don't have a heart rate monitor but the heart rate monitor is kind of is a very useful tool that i found and it kind of you can see it so you're more like accountable to yourself as well so you're not going to cheat like you're not going to uh i'm going to go a bit slower this time because i mean this interval is pretty brutal it kind of tak takes you out of breath but but it also very effective for v2 max and you know i lost a lot of uh visceral fat as well during that time so i went from like pretty pretty good viseral fat of 350 grams to 50 grams which is i don't know if it's too low but you know i wasn't planning to get it that low it just happened so and one of the biggest changes to my workout plan was i was doing the intervals and there is research that you know the hit intervals are very good for um visceral fat reduction as well nice so the hit the total hit that you said how many four rounds so 2 to four minutes on 2 to four minutes off so at most eight so it's about a 30 minute at most 15 to 30 minut yeah at maximum it's like 32 minutes and uh if i'm doing shorter intervals then it's usually because i'm feeling okay feeling a bit tired i'm going to take it easier so i'll do shorter intervals so i'll do still something and uh the first interval is obviously the always the hardest but the subsequent intervals usually feel pretty good all right so day one push day two legs day three pull day four hit for zone two or is it no no like i'm i'm alternating between so like monday is push tuesday is zone two wednesday is legs thursday is either rest or zone two friday is either you know rest hit or zone two then saturday it might be pool uh sunday is either rest zone two or hit depending yeah what i did before so five days combined weights and in cardio or six five or six five five or six yeah all right and then wait so taking it take it back so you're uh so in the strength training workouts you said you're doing for example two exercises on that monday for the push so uh i mean i guess i'm guessing you're resting between sets because it's not like a circuit training based thing so it's just taking your time and get or or do you have set goals where it's like all right i'm going to be in there for 45 minutes i'm going to do 15 sets like how do you think about within workout yeah i don't like have a goal okay 45 minutes sometimes i'm time constrained so then i'll only have 45 minutes or something but uh you know sometimes it might be 50 55 minutes as well depends yeah how much i rest between the sets so my strength training uh program is something i'll i'll pick two main compound lifts so for the pushing their bench press or the incline press which is know kind of the same it's just a different uh angle uh and the second exercise would be like over head press or some seated dumbbell should the press so kind of the horizontal plane and the vertical plane i'm always kind of training both in the same workout so the horizontal plane horizontal push exercise would be bench press and the vertical would be the shoulder press or the pulling muscle the horizontal would be the barbell row yep and the vertical would be the pull-up or something like that you could even even lean back and do kind of like an you know incline yeah you can do it for in many ways yeah but kind of the main yeah directions so uh yeah two exercises and uh i'm aiming for something like four to six reps with those compound exercises four to six reps is my working weight typically and uh i'll warm up you know warm up to the weight do four to six reps for typically i'll try to aim for three sets so the warmup sets don't count you know when i'm warming up with the bench press i'm gradually increasing the wait slightly every set as a warm-up that takes me something like 5 minutes maybe less uh and then four to six reps for three sets and i'm typically resting something like i try to rest you know as long as i need to but it's going to be something like three to four minutes so i'm not trying to get like a cardio workout with strength training i'm trying to apply the maximum amount of mechanical tension which is the biggest driver of muscle hy ropy and uh you can achieve that with many different rep schemes if you have like lighter reps you're doing like 10 to 12 reps then you just need to go to closer to failure you know one to two reps is uh like very close to your one rep max and it's uh going to be harder to you you would need to do like 10 sets of something like that to reach sufficient amount of volume with that but four to six reps three times at at least i find that it's a pretty decent amount amount of volume that uh is good for muscle growth and strength that development as well and uh yeah so i was just going to say so what are your thoughts on like i get circuit training based approach you'll potentially limit your maximum strength increases right because it's hard to have allout effort if you're doing four to six reps on a bench press and then four to six reps on a on a row right on a dumbbell row whatever you know the pole rows right so um but you're getting the cardiovascular stimulus your heart rate is staying elevated granted it may not get to 80% but in terms of the biggest bang for the book you could argue that maybe you don't have the the maximum strength you don't have the maximum cardio but you're getting the kind of the best of both worlds there so uh no thoughts on or what are your thoughts on circuit training based uh you know approaches yeah i think they definitely work and uh for people who have like not who who have like um let's say less time or something then it can be for sure like a good trade-off and you know the depends on your goals as well if you don't want to be yeah like you said you don't want to reach your maximum strength then you don't want to reach your maximum cardio then it's a good trade-off you know i like the the idea that you know the man that catches two rabbits or chases two rabbits catches none so i i like to be okay in the strength training workout i'm going to focus only on the strength i'm not going to even try to break a sweat like usually i don't yeah like get sweaty doing that um and with a cardio workout i'm training only cardio so i i feel like okay if you have the single focus then you'll reach the better results uh but you will have to like you know have separate workouts for that so i'm not usually doing cardio after strength training either because of that reason so i'm only having a strength day workout and a strength day and a cardio day a separate day so your cardio day you said is on day two but then you're training legs you know with uh dead uh squats deadlifts are day three or day two uh it's on day three yeah like wednesday yeah but day two squats so you're doing you know uh 55 60 minutes of running which is i mean granted it's type one type one type two a muscle fibers whereas you're working the type two you know two bs two x's when you're doing squats but there's still there has to be some element of fatigue going from day two into day three right so wouldn't that limit overall strength gains with the squats and and all all the other you know leg movements i haven't like noticed that like i i don't get like sore or anything from any of my workouts really unless i take like a break so yeah like the first workout after not having worked out that muscle for two weeks is going to feel like sore the next day but uh if i'm in my regular routine then i don't get sore from cardio like i could do cardio even every day and still work out with weights it it will be more like like center nervous fatigue that could be the limiting factor so if you're just overtraining every day then yeah your central nervous system will be the limiting factor for strength but uh i haven't experience that like because because zone 2 cardio for me is is is not it's not supposed to be intense like you're supposed to be doing it or you're supposed to be able to do it for many hours every day pretty much if you do it the right way so i'm not even yeah getting my heart rate super elevated it's like in the low 100s 120 130 something like that yeah but it's just the general fatigue whether it's central or just just type one type 2 a muscle fiber fatigue that may limit or maybe that helps you recruit more uh muscle fibers when you're doing your leg workouts if there is some just general leg fatigue when you're doing you know strength training the next day maybe that actually helps but you're adapted to it and you know i think most people they'd be you know can't do you know uh even though it's a relatively easy workout for you you've adapted to it whereas a 55 minute cardio workout i can't imagine most people are training legs the next day maybe the other way around where they train legs on day one and then do the 55 minute zone on day two because it's like you're not really training for perform performance zone too it's just kind of like an easy run right so right yeah i mean there is research that this active recovery is better for like performance so yeah like if you train legs and the next day you go for like a even like a jog or some easy cycling or something then that appears to be like better for recovery than just being you know sitting uh so any movement like light movement is good for recovery this active recovery but yeah you could easily overdo it but uh i've been doing it yeah for you know i've been lifting for 12 years and i've been yeah pretty much exercised a lot so my body is very like adapted to it for sure and then what about using like hrv or resting heart rate uh are you still tracking that or have do you have enough data year to year where you can see changes and avoiding age related declines for hrv and avoiding the age- related increase up to around 50 for resling heart rate still tracking that yeah like this one i've been tracking yet pretty consistently over the last four or five years and i mean it's pretty much the same as it was so i it might have improved slightly i don't recall exactly um the number off the top of my head when i started tracking it but uh you know back in 2019 something like that it was still yeah in the low 40s my resting heart rate nowadays it's something like 38 to 40 so it's slightly better and my hrv is kind of same it's been yeah like 100 over 100 uh the entire time nice so are you expecting to keep those data there as long as you're consistent with the workouts or you think there'll come a time when the workouts even even though you'll be consistent at some point maybe hrv starts to dip resting heart rate starts to increase if so what would you do in that in that situation or it doesn't matter hrv resting har doesn't matter no i you think that they're important for sure like uh i mean there yeah for sure will be some age related changes at least based on what we know about aging and in the studies as well you see heart rate increases and hrv decreases with age i think first of all i would take like a mini break so it might be that i you know because even now you know every once in a while my heart rate goes to 44 hrv goes to 89 or something uh so that could be that just yeah i need to sleep a little longer take like a few days off so i'll do it and it kind of normalizes so there's always like those things small things that uh need to be first like okay taken into account so is it maybe there's something in the diet maybe there's maybe you're getting uh some sort of a cold or infectious uh kind of conditions whatever it is uh to first like address those before make any conclusions but yeah theoretically so if my hrv begins to tank and my heart rate begins to increase with everything like being the same then um you know yeah i would you know i would first try it out and see okay is exercising that's going to improve those numbers again um and then make like adjustments according uh to that so e and even then that might be like okay we don't know which one is more important like okay is it is it more important to have this low resting heart rate and high hrv versus is it more important to keep exising uh so i guess we don't know that data so at that point it comes down to okay which one you choose which option so i wouldn't necessarily suggest exercising less in that case right but so i'm i'm guessing that you'll be able ble to best resist age related changes for hrv resting heart rate and whatever other biomarkers you know muscle mass visceral fat right with consistency of training over a long period of time but if you did start to see some dip knowing you're consistent with the exercise like you said you know is it infection you know what's the cause and then maybe you actually get closer to some kind of root cause of quote unquote aging in your case which would lead to immune activation and and overstressed which is what the lower hrv and higher heart rate resting heart rate uh so ideally you could probably catch that sooner because you're paying attention to it and it not may not necessarily have to do with exercise dose right so i wouldn't want you to cut down on the dose it's a matter of what's that underlying factor that's uh limiting your ability right because because then you're in that vicious cycle right right to caught my exercise dose my data goes back but now is that going to be bad long term because i've caught my exercise dose and that is below my peak fitness right so now you're on that slow decline trying to optimize opposed to what's the root underlying that hrv resting heart rate uh and that's probably independent of exercise as long as you're consistent with that over time right so i don't think anybody's thinking about it like that too it's you for sure yeah and i think that there's also like a certain reserve that you have so like for me like my heart rate is right now 3840 but 45 would be also excellent like you know there's actually like no data that 40 would be better than 45 not that i've seen and with hrv as well like okay is a hrv of 150 better than 120 versus 95 like we don't know that either because they're like so out of the normal in that sense uh so yeah maybe maybe if it goes from 120 to 95 i mean that's still super good and your heart rate goes from 38 to 48 then that's still like pretty good so yeah ah pretty good based on the average person but you versus you i mean is or it just doesn't matter to you right as long as you're in the quote unquote what's you know really good it's good enough for you versus there is an age related change it's not my best but i'm okay with that right for me for me things changing during aging and you know those are dirty words to me but how how about how do you see that yeah um hard to say yeah like it would be for for me yeah like a heart heart rate of 48 would be bad or not bad but it's kind of heading in the wrong direction so um i would first i would definitely try to okay make some different adjustments to my diet or exercise sleep etc to try to get it back down to normal but you know if someone else is you know going from 45 to 48 then that for them might not be that big of a deal yeah all right so let's go the two more two more important not more important but also uh as a as a part of the optimizing the base right so sleep and supplements right so do you have like a sleep uh hygiene approach or it's just a sleep sleep when i'm tired how do you think about sleep optimization yeah sleep is obviously very important and um i have like a pretty simple sleep routine so a few key things that i try to uh follow so i try to like minimize this bright light in the evening bright artificial light so instead of having like this blue and kind of ceiling lamps i use like uh like a pink himon lamp in the bedroom or you know i might have some like red light bulb like like something like this you know the wavelength nanometers no it's it's it's a regular light bulb but it's red so like it has the red light wavelengths but uh something like that and then i'll wear like some of the blue blocking glasses or something that as well to kind of have if i'm using like my smartphone to look at something then i'll wear the blue bling glasses and that's kind of useful now is it super mandatory to wear the blue blockers i don't think it's like the first thing that matters the consistency of the bedtime is probably the you or like you know first thing is make sure you get the seven to eight hours and then the consistency of going to bed around the same time on a regular basis those are the most important parts and uh what i found is yeah dimming down the lights is kind of good for my sleep as well that um helps to wind down easily and uh for example if i'm recording something late like a podcast not today but uh on some days it's like at the 900 p.m. Which is like one one hour before my bedtime then uh i do feel that like this kind of very bright light does keep me up a bit longer if i if i do that so um yeah i mean there's some research about the blue blockers being useful for insomnia and sleep and uh from a like mechanistic perspective then the bright lights do suppress melatonin and in my opinion like melatonin is one of the like primary antiaging hormones so not only for sleep but also as an antioxidant and regulator of these other systems in the body like glathe and autophagy and those kind of things so i don't want to like you know suppress my melatonin in the evening before bed when you're supposed to have the highest amounts of melatonin so uh yeah that's kind of uh what i kind of do um food intake i stop eating yet something like five hours before bed i've noticed that it's good for my sleep if i you know eat large dinner too close to bed then um my deep sleep is slightly lower and and uh it takes me a bit longer to fall asleep but uh if i go to bed slightly hungry then i get like super good uh deep sleeps and in the morning you know i wake up between 6:00 to 7:00 but but uh yeah like if i wake up too early then i'm going to feel a bit tired so i ideally want to aim for yeah something like seven seven and a half to eight hours per night for sleep so that that that's when i feel like pretty the best with that blackout shades are you paying attention to room temperature and humidity uh do you have a bed cooling like any of those yeah i do have blackout curtains so in the winter months it doesn't matter because you go to bed and wake up when it's dark outside anyway but uh in the summer the sun does rise pretty early here so it rises even like 4:00 a.m. So i even though i would have the blackout curtains some of the light might come through so i'll use like a sleep mask that's like the best thing in the summer so uh i'll use that uh with like air quality i just usually ventilate the room before bed and in the morning i had to open windows and let the wind in there i do have like some uh air filtration device as well i'll i might run that for 30 minutes a few hours before bed but i don't have like any specific like uh like that with cooling i use this uh eight sleep mattress that's uh in the summer is definitely super good because if it's too hot then i don't really like yeah one of the biggest things that mess up my sleep would be if it's too hot or if it's like super bright lights um immediately before bed so yeah like the cooling mattress is pretty good in the winter i don't use it that much but in the summer definitely with supplements i take like a micro do melatonin every once in a while so like 0.3 milligrams and um i take glycine with my tea in the evening so that's like two hours before bed and uh i don't take any other like real steep uh supplements so yeah that's pretty much it how much uh glycine yeah like uh you know i'm getting something like 10 to 15 grams of glycine per day and in the evening with a tea it might be one teaspoon so that's like three three grams i guess and uh i also put it like into my protein shake so and uh maybe with the cottage cheese as well in the evening so yeah i'm getting at least 10 grams per day and that's based on the gluty studies and glycine restoration avoiding age related decline um yeah partly um it's also with the the methan balance so you know excess methan and two low glycine status in animal studies are linked to shorter lifespans you know of course in humans it's not possible to know that but in humans they find that exis methine and low glycin status also increases visceral fat or it's associated with higher visceral fat so uh yeah i think you need glycine for many things like the glan synthesis collagen synthesis as well you need it for methan and glycine balance it also supports creatin synthesis it's good for sleep lowers blood sugar so i think you know most people just aren't getting enough glycine from the regular diet so unless you are eating pork skin or pork rinds or or pure gelatin desserts or just making jello yourself then you're not really getting that much glycine and chances are you're getting too much methine if you're eating muscle meat and eggs and those kind of things so uh yeah i think most people would need at least like three five grams and personally i think like you know 10 grams up to 10 grams is is better all right so glycine sounds like that's the uh dominant supplement in the approach what else do you have any other how many supplements and then what's uh what's the top five yeah currently i'm taking quite a limited amount of supplements i'm taking like six or seven and um they are yeah glycine collagen so collagen separately because you only get three grams of glycine from 10 grams of collagen and uh there's you know a lot of the studies that collagen peptides improve skin antiaging and skin elasticity so u yeah i'm using kind of for that reason uh third supplement is tmg so trimethyl glycine and that's i take that for my homoy levels so my homine was slightly elevated it was like 12 i started taking two gram of tmg and it dropped to nine and yeah i'm trying to see if i'm getting it closer to five which would be more optimal and uh four supplement creatine i don't take creatine like every day but i take it like 80% of the time so creating you obviously for muscle strength and muscle power it also helps with uh some of the methylation it's good for the brain it's not necessarily useful for sleep but it can counteract like sleep restriction or the negative effects of sleep restriction and it can like uh i guess yeah reduce sleep demand so you're able to get away with a slightly less sleep so yeah it's one of the most like researched supplements for our sports performance specifically i take that and magnesium is the fifth one so i'll take i try to yeah maybe even like 400 milligrams of magnesium a day sometimes less but uh that's because you know magnesium deficien is very common and uh i'm just using that as more like insurance policy uh to like prevent any like magnesium deficiency uh what else six supplement uh is omega-3s so i'm taking 1.5 grams of epad dha combined and the reason for that is to increase the omega-3 index so it was 9% which is uh above the optimal you but uh we'll see maybe 10 maybe maybe it goes to 10% but i'm not like really pushing it that hard so 9% is pretty good so over 8% is uh is like the best optimal zone so last yeah go ahead go ahead last supplement yeah last supplement would be melatonin i don't think every day but a few times a week so in terms of what's optimal for the omega-3 index i mean you could technically look at the if you have tracked biomarker data on the same day as omega-3 index you could look at correlations right because just because you know that you're you have this reference range and what's considered high in your case is that significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction then wrong right and then if not maybe it's not 10 11% maybe actually 88.4% maybe best in your case right so just an idea for that more tight traded spef yeah yeah but my yeah my biomarkers have improved as well while i've increased omega-3s but you know i've done things to my biomarkers that don't include the omega-3 supplement so what about weak spots so you mentioned homine and then taking tmg but what do you have current weak spots whether it's biomarkers whether it's training uh and actually wait before going there i going back to the training real quick so what about i'm guessing you're you're doing obviously full range of motion or or you know i mean the bench press is you know touch the chest of the bar uh you know as to grass with the squats uh or is it 90 degrees and then are you doing any flexibility training uh mobility work you know balance training or is this just you know you're doing a lot already so you're you'll have higher than usual levels of all these things but not specifically training it right yeah i tried to do full range of motion most exercises with the squats it kind of varies if i'm doing the high bar versus the low bar squat so if it's the low bar squat then i'll go yeah like slightly below 90 dees so like you know just the hips slightly below the knees um and with with that the the weight would be heavier whereas if i'm doing the high bar squat then the weight would be lighter but i would go deeper so yeah like uh glutes touching the the the calves ces yeah so um yeah yeah depends on a lot of the exercise but you know bench press i'll go full range of motion rows uh pull-ups and yeah with flexibility and stretching um like i do some like easy stretching exercises so like some like easy front splits i'm not i'm not as flexible as to do a front split right now because i'm not like directly training it but i could you know get it in a in a few weeks if i were to train it so i'm like you know decently flexible but not like crazy flexible because i'm not uh chasing it specifically so i do like some mobility exercises like every day i'll try to get into the the the the deep squat position even when i'm like you know checking my phone or playing with my dog or something like that like it just take a moment to do some mobility at the same time uh i try to do some of this this knees over toes kind of exercises slightly where you're like uh doing like a lunge with knees going over the toes so like a full range of motion if i if i've been sitting a lot like after driving or something like that then i'll do the what's it called the couch stretch or something where you're stretching the front hip part i you know a few times a day i'll do the touch the floor with the hands stretch or touch your toes with the floors um every day i'll try to hang from somewhere to kind of decompress the spine and loosen the shoulder joints so if i'm not even training pull-ups then i'll still you know hang from somewhere you know every every workout at the gym i'm hanging there for you know a minute or two on the bar and uh yeah that's pretty much it like you know i do a deep squat i hang a little bit stretching for the for the front split exercise and uh yeah that i think that covers most of what i need with without like specifically training for mobility and flexibility totally underrated i think flexibility mobility i mean you it sounds like you're doing a lot there right so you're good but i think most people especially in longevity even health and fitness pay almost zero attention to these things and just using like the knees over toes as an example i mean the strengthening in the knee joint itself and the ligaments there you don't you're not i mean you'll get it from a squat but by actively going knees over toes i mean it's a totally different feeling even doing like a s squats i mean yeah i'm doing squats and deadlifts and and lunges and doing the cissy squats there's so much stress on the joint itself that it's got to get stronger and you know more fit right so i think when you consider joint mobility in older age i mean you could make an argument that joint mobility may be a huge underlying factor in terms of the youthful gate and phenotype right because if you can barely get off the floor because your joints are weak even if your muscles are strong you're going to look older right so yeah absolutely yeah um pretty underrated for sure yeah all right so weak spots so do you have any weak spots right now that you consider weak spots whether it's biomarkers or stuff you're trying to get stronger at in certain movements um or everything's good you you're you're just you know um yeah i mean for sure the homo cine would be a weak spot well not right now anymore has been like it's been normalizing um but yeah it's something that i'm like trying to optimize even even more other week spots um i'm sure yeah like a lot of people they like to point out some specific uh small things like okay your this marker isn't in the exact optimal range or something like that but yeah personally i don't consider them like weak spots so um like what yeah like what except the homoy part which is is improving which which biomarkers would people think that yours aren't in the optimal range i've seen your data it's all pretty close yeah well i mean there's always some people who say your cholesterol is high or your cholesterol is too low so you you'll never never be able to like uh satisfy everyone with that number so even if my ldl is like 77 i i mean that's pretty pretty good uh and even even then some people will say oh it should be 40 or uh you know or it's too low like your ldl should be 150 or something depends who who asks so i don't take like that kind of um uh comments seriously because you know i've seen the data myself i've looked at all the research regarding like what are the optimal ranges for these markers so i'm i'm like pretty uh happy with that and you know the most important part is maintaining it so right now it's relatively easy for me to do you know the the challenge is to do that in 10 20 30 40 50 years so uh that's where the real like fun or the challenge begins so ldl it it's inverse youu right it's in terms of aging so it's low in youth peaks in midlife and then it's low older at older age advanced age so for the people that are saying that it's too low most of those studies looking at all cause mortality risk are looking at people basically in their 50s or people in their 80s and clearly people in their 80s i mean it's the downward sloping thing right so how would you know if we're on the lower side of youth or aged right well if if your albumin's high and lymphocytes are high and inflammation is low it's a part of the phenotype you're good that's how that's how i rationalize but uh i mean more direct measures of atherosclerosis i don't know if you're looking at like the ankle brachial index which is a pretty good measure um you know because if you have low ldl but then you've got high lipoprotein a or high you don't have high tri triglycerides but high apo b it is possible to have relatively low levels of certain lipoproteins and higher levels of others that are unmeasured yeah yeah i mean yeah the ldl is it itself isn't the only thing that matters for sure like uh other lipoproteins my lp little a is low fortunately it's actually like 2.4 so that's like you know genetically determined um my ap is also pretty low it's like again 73 or might be even lower than that uh maybe it was in 60s or low 70s so that's also like a pretty low so uh yeah vldl is low so yeah so those are actually if you if you look under the hood for den and pace so den and pace was trained on 19 biomarkers besides v2 max was one of them so obviously you're good there right so i think it was what over 60 60 more more recently right so l ldl is on is uh was so right so you've got these 19 biomarkers and then what's the epigenetic profile of people who had the quotequote youthful data versus the age data ldl was there lipoprotein a was there april b was there so you're all good i mean that probably contributes i don't know maybe it's b2 max the ep related to that that's contributing more i don't know but all those other markers that are relatively low and on the youthful side that's the argument against your data being too low yeah i mean well you know the two low argument like you said comes from the studies where low cholest low cholesterol was linked to higher mortality but that's because they didn't account for things like malnutrition and cancer and uh frailty and those conditions so yeah like if you're 80 years old you're malnourished your underweight your l will go down because of the malnourishment and you die because of breaking a hip or something like that whereas if you account for those then low well isn't harmful at all and especially in the younger age group of you know 18 to 45 uh it's uh there's no this u-shaped association like it's kind of a linear almost so why do you think going back to homocysteine do you think that's maybe the first weakness in the chain in terms of it increases during aging uh why do you think do is this is the sign that you know maybe methylation is one of the first things that may go wrong and you've got to actively work to reverse that um yeah yeah i think i think i might have something yeah methylation related genetics or like shortcomings with there because you know homoy also have seen it varies a lot between people you know joe kohan is another person who has high homoy levels and he takes like a ton of different supplements to lower it and it still isn't like uh optimal whereas you you have some other people who even like take steroids and stuff and their and their homoy is five after just taking a few of these methyl donor supplements so and you know steroids will increase homosysteine whereas you know me and joe so i i've recently introduced some of these methyl donor supplements so it's going down so for me it appears to work so i i just need to like measure it again maybe change some of the supplements i'm taking maybe increase b b12 intake or something um increased tmg whatever it is but joe for example he's taking already a lot of supplements and he's homoy is i think he's also like nine right now has joe always i mean is maybe it's a genetic issue in his case but has yours always been has it been lower in the past and now it was at 12 where it's increased during aging because that would argue against the genetic component is always been something yeah like 11 12 13 something that um as far as i can remember for my blood markers or as far as i measure them so for joe like you know he tracks everything pretty much as well or you know he he has a very thorough understanding of his of his blood work over time so for him it's appears to be genetic um for me i think it might fix more easily than for him perhaps but i'm i'm going to go measure it like next week after having taken uh more tmg so i'm going to see if the higher dose of tmg because in the clinical trials four to six grams is what they've used with tmg for homocystine so i've been increasing it to four grams over the last maybe month and uh i'm going to see if it lowered the homine more but there's also the studies that tmg over two grams increases cholesterol so i'm going to measure that again as well to see okay is there a trade-off so then you need to kind of okay what's the tradeoff nice so i don't know if it's specifically related to homosysteine but there are gut bacterial enzymes that uh degrade that remove methyl groups one example being there are caffeine so caffeine has methyl groups at three nitrogens so there are caffeine demethylases that are um the the gut bacterial that their activity increases with an increase in gut ph so more alkaline gut the gut becomes more alkaline during aging so i don't know if that's one reason why homoy would increase during aging because you've got lack of methal donors maybe because the gut gets more alkaline i don't know if that's the case in your situation but um yeah something yeah that's something that's my mind all right so so let's uh all right so let's get into some of the fun stuff so like favorite movies favorite music uh what makes you know what's what makes the scene tick right um well my favorite movies are probably like the lord of the rings movies the trilogy so like you know i've always been like a fan of that kind of uh those kind of movies uh i don't like watch a bunch of movies right now like i'm not like tracking new movies and then okay i'm going to go see them i watched you know things like dune when it came out yeah like occasional few movies but the my favorite genre is probably something like fantasy related like uh star wars uh lord of the rings uh dune or those kind of things uh music music wise i like like heavier music so like uh death metal and those kind of things which uh yeah i've i've liked since uh since as a child almost like i think i started listening this music when i was maybe 13 or something like that so yeah 17 years ago so over half of my life i've been listening to that and uh yeah i mean that's yeah i other than that i like you know playay with my dog spend time with my wife and uh yeah kind of uh i don't have any like specific hobbies besides like you know research and uh exercise wait so i have two another question that leads off of that but wait which bands which death metal bands met like is metallica against machine or how how how hard is right right well i think yeah like i mean metallic isn't uh heavy enough so um i like more like a new wave of this death metal so like it's called actually death core so it's not uh as like old school metal but you know my favorite band's something like laa shore white chapel signs of the swarm uh what else uh immortal disfigurement is one uh yeah like i mean i can name a few more but you know i don't know if you've even heard of them no i'm gna look them up that way and so do you listen to death metal when you're working out what's the workout music yeah i mean usually it's it's uh the death metal music i might listen to some podcast as well when i'm working out if i'm writing or you know working on the computer then i'll listen to the music uh if i'm taking a nap i'll listen to the music but death metal but is it exclusively death metal like during the work out while like while writing while researching or is it or is it some variance with other stuff too i mean there are like some soft genres of that you know there's like metal core there's like po hardcore or something like that uh but they're all in the kind of same ballpark with that so i don't like like rap or edm or or acoustic music or something that all right so cool all right so then what doesn't the world know about you like what actually and along those lines so is is you know making content related to longevity is that the goal for as long as you you know as long as you can or want to or do you see other stuff that you're interested in that you'd be making content on and then you said you have no hobbies but um uh like are there things that interest you outside of you know 8,000 8,000 references you know how yeah what do your thought about that well you know i studied anthropology in university and i like you know history i like philosophy a little bit i like just the human species or like understanding human species i you know i pay attention to like politics a little bit and i pay attention to uh culture and those kind of things and uh anthrop ology in general so i i i like the idea of human evolution and uh um advancing the human species so that's why i'm interested in the longevity idea that i think that's kind of the next step in the human evolution of you know extending human lifespan we're obviously not anywhere close to that yet but i'm like interested in researching that and i think it's you know the most interesting uh problem to solve so like you know weight loss is relatively easy in terms of like the mechanisms and understanding how it works but uh you know aging and longevity is much harder like we don't even know how it works yet completely so that's why i'm like interested in it as like an from an anthropological uh perspective of how do we actually extend human uh lifespan and i think that's that's the future kind of for the human species in the next few century or or beyond and um yeah what no one knows about me or like the future plans with my my content and such um is uh i am planning to like evolve myself as as well i don't think i'll be staying only like as a content creator i have like a few business ideas that i'm going to work on with some people over the next few years as well and uh it's kind of but it's in the vein of this longevity and life extension uh area so uh yeah i mean the business part is a like a mandatory part of this as well you know i don't consider myself like a researcher obviously i'm not a scientist um but i'm not like some sort of uh i i don't like think myself as some sort of a regular influencer either so but i i do like to yeah like the idea of contributing to the field in some shape or form and uh yeah actually providing some sort of a service to people that would support their longevity uh in a more like meaningful and effective way in the future so so that's indefinitely the the you know it's you see yourself continuing on that path for as long as you can or there's like you said i i i heard you say about evolution but are there so let's assume that you know there is no more death there is no more aging what are you doing then well i think i'll i would i would uh think about it when we actually reach that immortality so like what do you do when you're immortal like let's first try to get immortality i would say but um you know i mean you know i would probably like spend so if you have an infinite amount of time to do everything then you would end up doing everything almost like um you know i don't maybe not because you you could you could travel everywhere you could experience all the things in the world related to culture and uh adventures or something like that to food uh entertainment like like that if you have infinite amount of time so you know i would probably end up doing a lot of that those kind of things but i i like like my routine i you know i would exercise and kind of follow the same routines even if there was like no health benefits to it almost like uh i like that kind of uh those activities my wife is also similar that we both are health conscious we uh take care of oursel uh and uh yeah we enjoy spending time together as well so you know i would you know spend more time with my wife doing different things and yeah experiencing the world but right now i'm already super happy already so yeah i don't know if what what i would change if there was like no no mandatory need so if you could just take like in the future you take a pill that uh you know gives you all the benefits of exercise and uh makes you live longer you i would still probably do some of my exercise like i would i would probably make it more fun like i would do you know bouldering uh i would do you know some maybe gymnastics exercises so i would still do some form of like movement like i like to hike in nature i like to uh do some cycling you know that's kind of enjoyable for mean yeah so i already know what i would do but uh you know that's a story for another day but i don't think i don't think you know you were saying that you don't see yourself as just as an influencer but not a scientist either right or scientist uh re research rather i mean that that's a very debatable you know uh tiptoe right so the reason i say that is you know harold catcher catcher the e5 you know about this uh you know where they're they they took the plasma fraction from old old rats uh they're trying to give it to young as rejuvenation factors right so he just published like a short thing showing like some bad aging on one hand and then he put he just happened to put on the other hand the e5 you know hey let's see right and if you look at the two one look really young his own hand and the other doesn't right so let's assume he doesn't have the credentials you know a phd right and he posts something like that which is literally preliminary data it's not a study of 50 people or a thousand people so i mean i i don't see it as this thing where you need to have like you physically or anyone else needs to physically have the credentials if they're doing these interventions and they've tracked it in a you know rigorously scientific way you know whether it's 10 blood tests or five blood tests or whatever may be that's science that's actual research right and i don't think you need to have the credentials granted people who have the credentials probably would be more likely to be doing these things but i think we're in a different era where um citizen science can be immensely powerful and and the credentials don't there are plenty of people cr with credentials who don't train or take care of themselves and what good what good is that right so um so so that's how i see it i mean i see it as preliminary data at the individual level that may actually ends up translating to the broad masses so uh yeah right about this influencer stuff but the the definition of what makes a scientist debatable right i see you in that vein i don't think you could put together a book like that and not have that kind of rigorous level you know understanding and training so yeah well for sure like i also believe that you know what matters yeah like is the actual message or the accuracy of of what said than rather like who says it so uh you know you know i'm on i use x the twitter and you know there's a lot of doctors from all different fields uh spewing nonsense about you know diet or whatever it is so yeah like it's it's not exclusive to regular people or influencers to spread misinformation so like a lot of doctors also do it quite frequently so yeah but not necessarily always purposeful misinformation it could be just them looking at the data in a certain way and then from whatever their back or bias maybe they've interpreted it in in another way right so that misinformation versus disinformation unless it's actively intentional versus someone's interpretation of the data and then that being interpreted as mis misinformation of disinformation that's a very tricky tricky slope like even when i hear politicians talk about these things where hey we're going to crack down a misinformation who decides like that that's a very subjective thing true yeah so all right uh some more fun stuff so aliens are real aliens make believe what do you think what do you think about that um i mean it's uh more likely that they are real than they're not you know because the vastness of the universe you know even though like it requires such perfect conditions for life to emerge uh then just the vastness of the universe it almost makes it impossible that it wouldn't have happened somewhere else you know i think there's a lot of different stages of evolution throughout the univer universe like there's there's uh planets with uh lower life forms than ours and higher life forms than ours it's just that yeah the universe is so massive that it's um very unlikely that there isn't any like um other other life out there in my opinion not just the universe the galaxy right i mean the galaxy all of the universes but wait you assume that so the earth is what how many 4 something billion years old why couldn't they have evolved here and they're still here like and just in in line with that idea 300 years ago the idea that bacteria existed nobody knew right and then you know this scientist was studying under a micros microscope and saw this stuff and then you know 300 years later we know that microbes are everywhere we live in their in their world right so who's to say that at some point over the past four billion years or maybe multiple points r and fall uh some advanced civilization exists and have either cloaked themselves or live in the ocean who who's to say they're not already here right for sure yeah i mean we don't know that yeah all right anyway okay we covered it all i think so uh so for everyone wants to get seams book it's at seam. Uh giant giant juggernaut of 8,000 references so uh with that thanks it's current joh amaz on yeah like i switch to the amazon right now ah cool and you also do uh consulting right so people can you know use you uh you know use your services to to improve their health and potentially longevity right so uh so anyway thanks seam for uh for being on today yeah my pleasure and yeah always happy to talk with you cool all right ciao
