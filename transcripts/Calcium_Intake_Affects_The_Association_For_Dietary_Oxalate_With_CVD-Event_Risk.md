## Transcript

My current diet contains a lot of oxalate for example i eat a lot of spinach and spinach is a rich source of oxalate ranging from 460 to more than 1100 milligrams per 100 grams of spinach so for the 49 day period that corresponded to blood test number two in mid-march i averaged about 138 grams of spinach per day so when multiplied by the amount of oxalate found in steamed spinach that yields about 1100 milligrams of oxalate per day just from spinach alone but that's not the only source of oxalate that i get in my diet i also eat a lot of beets so for blood test number two again that 49 day period that corresponded to that blood test i averaged about 195 grams of raw beets per day and when multiplying those values yields about 125 milligrams of oxalate per day and last but not least oxalate is also found in carrots and i eat a lot of carrots in particular raw carrots so for blood test number two i averaged about 337 grams of carrots per day which when multiplied by the amount of oxalate found in raw carrots yields 148 milligrams of oxalate per day just from carrots so when summing these three foods just from these three foods i get almost 1400 milligrams of oxalate per day so is this amount of oxalate potentially bad for health so with that in mind let's take a look at data from this recently published study dietary oxalate to calcium ratio and incident cardiovascular events a 10-year follow-up among an asian population so the key words here are dietary oxalate intake and the incidence of cardiovascular events but also note that in the title we see that calcium may affect this relationship so let's jump into the data and see how it goes so here we're looking at risk for any cardiovascular disease cbd related event versus the dietary oxalate intake so first it's important to define what were the cvd related events so cbd related events included probable and definite or definite myocardial infarction so heart attack unstable angina pectoris which is a chest pain that worsens angiographic confirmed coronary heart disease so atherosclerosis as confirmed by angiography and then any cardiovascular death including a fatal heart attack coronary heart disease so atherosclerosis or stroke all right so how what's the association for dietary oxalate intake with these cardiovascular disease related events so dietary oxalate was divided into three tertiles uh low medium and high so low oxalate intake was defined had a median value of 120 milligrams of oxalate per day tertile 2 had 181 as a median value and tertile 3 had 277 as a medium value so right from the start we can see that i would at least fall into tertile 3 the highest oxalate intake group so let's take a look at the association for dietary oxalate intake with cbd event risk so that's the crude association unadjusted and when compared with people who were in the lowest uh tertile for oxalate intake we can see that there is a statistically significant association for oxalate intake with cbd events in particular people who ate in in tertile 2 181 milligrams of oxalate per day and in tertile 3 we see significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease events in association with higher oxalate intakes so more than 181 milligrams of oxalate per day but note that many factors can impact this association the association for dietary oxalate intake with cardiovascular disease events so what might those be so that's what's shown here we're looking at data on the left for people that had a cardiovascular disease related outcome on the left and people who did not on the right and you can see the total sample size for this study was about 3 000 people so note that people who did have a cvd related uh event were older uh more men than women there were more smokers uh they had a higher bmi a higher waist circumference so uh greater abdominal uh adiposity greater uh fatness in the abdominal region they had a higher blood pressure in in as indicated both by systolic and diastolic people that had cbd events had higher glucose higher triglycerides lower hdl and then worse kidney function as indicated by a higher serum level of creatinine cr which is used to derive egfr so a lower egfr on people that had uh more cbd events or had a cbd related outcome all right so now that we've seen these data it's important to note that any statistical model that looks at the association between dietary oxalate intake with cvd event risk should include adjustment for these variables so did they adjust for these variables in the study so let's take a look at what they included for model one so model one included data for age tc total cholesterol hdl systolic blood pressure but interestingly not diastolic treatment for hypertension htn smoking and type 2 diabetes which accounts for elevated glucose levels so then what was the association for dietary oxalate after adjusting for these factors so when compared with the lowest oxalate intake we can again see a statistically significant association between oxalate with cbd event risk and this is true now only for the highest oxalate group but not for the intermediate oxalate group of a that had an intake of 181 milligrams uh of oxalate per day so from this we can conclude that after accounting for model 1 variables a relatively higher dietary oxalate intake is still significantly associated with an increased cbd event risk all right so what about the other models so in model 2 they included model one variables and adjusted for kidney function with egfr and when compared with the lowest intake of oxalate we can see that there is a significant association as indicated by the p-value 0.03 and this is true for the again the highest oxalate intake group with a 60 increased risk for a cvd event but not for the intermediate oxalate intake group which you can see by that confidence interval interval in parenthesis 0.93 to 1.89 it overlaps with one so when the confidence interval overlaps with one it's not statistically significant so we can adjust our summary statement to also include model two variables so after accounting for model one and model two variables that the relatively higher dietary oxalate intake is still significantly associated with an increased cvd event risk all right what about model three so in model 3 it included model 1 and model 2 factors but then also it adjusted for calorie fat and fiber intake and now we can see that statistical significance is lost but note that for the highest oxalate intake group that confidence interval is still completely above one it doesn't overlap so there is a 49 47 increased risk for cvd events after adjusting for all these variables in people that had relatively high 200 with a median value of 277 milligrams per day of oxalate but not for the intermediate group so again as you can see we can annotate our summary statement to after adjusting for all these variables a relatively higher dietary oxalate intake is still sorry still significantly associated with an increased cbd event risk all right so if you remember in the title uh we saw that dietary calcium may uh affect the association between oxalate intake with uh cbd event risk so how does dietary calcium intake affect this association but before going there it's important to ask why should we expect that calcium can impact this association so dietary calcium impacts the absorption of dietary oxalate into the blood and that's what's illustrated here so when looking at the intestinal tract free oxalate anions ox to minus right there are absorbed into the systemic circulation as shown there and then once in the blood they can then uh travel to uh and accumulate to struck into structural tissues and organs where they can then potentially adversely affect health so in the presence of calcium though calcium binds to oxalate which then targets it for excretion first in feces as shown there so a relatively higher dietary calcium intake should lead to reduced absorption of dietary oxalate into the systemic accumul systemic circulation leading to less accumulation in target tissues and organs and then potentially less affecting uh overall health now note that that's not the only way to uh calcium intake is not the only way to potentially um reduce oxalate absorption or to to get rid of oxalate and the other way is free oxalate in blood can be urinated we can pee it out and we can do that when there's good kidney function but when there's poor kidney function less oxalate is excreted by via urine so that illustrates the importance of having good kidney function if you're eating a potentially high oxalate containing diet now note that diet and kidney function aren't the only ways to potentially um reduce oxalate in oxalates amounts in the blood uh note that the liver and also red blood cells although i haven't illustrated it on this slide the liver can produce oxalate via glycolate metabolism as shown there and then once the liver produces produces it can be released from the liver or released in red blood cells and where it can lead to accumulation in blood so now that we know that calcium affects oxalate absorption into the blood now we can address that question how does dietary calcium intake affect this association for oxalate intake with cvd event risk so here we're looking at risk for any cvd related event versus dietary oxalate intake and people consuming low medium or high calcium diets and this is data from the same study that was uh listed on the opening slide so again we've got our three tertiles of oxalate intake 120 181 and 277 as median values for each of those three groups but then we've got people who are eating a low calcium diet and this was defined as 760 milligrams per day and we can see that calcium impacts the association for oxalate with uh cvd event risk as the p-value for that association we can see that it's lower than 0.05 so that's a statistically significant association so what does the data show so when computer com compared with people on uh a low oxalate low calcium diet people that were on a relatively higher uh oxalate low calcium diet both tertile two and tertile three had significantly increased risk for a cvd event 92 percent increased in tertia ii and 142 increased in tertile iii so a relatively higher dietary oxalate intake more than 181 milligrams per day is significantly associated with an increased cbd event risk and people consuming a low calcium diet so what about cbd event risk on higher calcium containing diets both the medium and high calcium diets are shown there so in the medium calcium diet these uh these are people that average uh that had a median calcium intake of 1180 milligrams per day and on the high calcium diet the median intake was 1760 milligrams per day and we can see from the p-values that there weren't any significant associations between dietary oxalate with cbd event risk after accounting for calcium intake in the medium and high calcium groups so let's just take a quick look at that data so when compared with the lowest oxalate intake and medium and high calcium diets we can see that the confidence interval for both tertile two point six one two two two eight two point two eight and point six seven to two point five one so you can see it overlaps with one so tertile two is not significantly different from tertile one data and similarly tertile three we can also see the overlap for the confidence intervals both on the medium and high calcium diets when compared with the lowest oxalate intake turtle one versus tertile three so although a relatively high dietary oxalate intake more than 181 milligrams per day is significantly associated with an increased cvd event risk in people consuming a low calcium diet this is not true at least based on this study for people consuming more than 1100 uh almost 1200 milligrams per day of calcium so to bring it back to the original question is my oxalate intake of about 1400 milligrams per day at least 1400 a bad for health uh we can put my data into context so first i would fall into tertile three as mentioned before with a median value of 277 i'm clearly within that group with almost 1400 milligrams of oxalate per day but then my average daily calcium intake for blood test number two was 12 19 milligrams per day and if for those who don't know i use a food scale i weigh all of my food and then log that into an online app so uh this is a as close to uh as accurate of a calcium intake as it can be as as i'm weighing all my food and logging it so 12 19 a milligrams per day for calcium would put me in the medium calcium diet and when looking at the data for that we can see that having a medium calcium diet but high oxalate was not significantly associated with an increased cbd event risk when compared with lower oxalate intakes on a medium calcium diet so based on that i may be okay no increased risk for cbd based on my hot relatively high oxalate intake but mostly because of my high relatively high calcium intake all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to
