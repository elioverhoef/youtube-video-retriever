# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #2 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Earlier this week i blood tested for the second time in 2022 and note that this is my 36 blood test since august of 2015. So with that in mind what's my biological age so here we can see the nine biomarkers that are contained within morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric for calculating biological age and if you have your own data for this you can calculate your own biological age using levine's test there's a link in the video's description so feel free to use that now also note that full blood test data with screenshots for the lab reports will be at the end of the video all right so when entering these by nine biomarker values we can see that my phenotypic age or my biological age is 35.4 years which is 13.7 years younger than my chronological so as a quick note note that uh quest which was the lab that performed these measurements quest high sensitivity c-reactive protein measurement was defined as less than 0.3 milligrams per liter which means that the upper limit of my value was at most 0.3 but it could be somewhere lower than that as my data seems to be below their limit of detection so the 35.4 could be somewhat better but it's not worse than 35.4 all right so for more context let's have a look at more biological age results since 2018 one one blood test is important but let's see what the trends are over the past few years and we can see that data here we've got biological age on the y-axis plotted against time so i first started measuring c-reactive protein in 2018 that's why i have relatively few data points uh going back to four four years so from 2018 to 2019 we can see that i only have three blood tests three blood test values for phenotypic age over that two year period and my average biological age was 36.1 years so then in 2020 i decided to test more often and then we can see over six tests in 2020 my average levine's test phenoage or biological age was 35.6 years similarly it was also 35.6 years in six tests in 2021 and then we can see the two green dots are 2022 and my average so far over those first two tests is 34 years now note that prior to 2022 my average pheno age age reduction was 11.9 years so about 12 years younger than my chronological over 15 tests from 2018 through 2021. In 2022 so far over those two tests i now have a 15-year average reduction so that's a further three-year reduction so 2022 is off to a good start so note that phenoage includes chronological age in its model which limits the maximum biological age reduction it's only about a 20-year reduction that one can obtain and if you're 80 years old but your all your biomarkers in that test are youthful are you really somewhere around 60 or some age younger so in contrast aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so let's have a look at that data so aging.ai is also a free to use tool and i should note i'm not sponsored by morgan levine or her lab or aging.ai i'm just using these tools so when entering the 19 biomarkers on aging.ai uh as we can see here and for anyone who wants to double check my data uh you can enter these data and using the north american data set i'm i've always been in the united states for my whole my whole life so i use that data set uh so we can check my results if you're interested so when i'm entering these 19 biomarker values we can see that my aging.ai age is 28 years old which is 21.1 years younger than my chronological so just like we did for levine's test looking at more context over the past few years let's do the same thing for aging.ai how does this 28 year old biological age with aging.eye look in comparison to all the rest of my data over the past few years so i have a lot more data for aging.ai going all the way back to 2009 and that's because uh c-reactive protein isn't a commonly performed measurement in uh the standard blood test that you go eddie to when you get at a yearly physical so i've had to add that on to my test when i when i measure so going back to 2009 i wasn't measuring c-reactive protein in my blood test because it wasn't a commonly available uh measurement so that's why i have more data for aging.ai because all of these 19 component biomarkers are found on a standard chemistry panel and a complete blood count cbc so from 2009 to 2013 i was only going to the doctor about once a year at most and we as we can see over that about five year period i only had three blood test measurements for aging.ai age and my average age was 32 years and that was pre-diet tracking so back then i wasn't tracking my diet every day and i started that in april of 2015. So uh weighing all my food entering those amounts into an online nutrition app recording that data into an excel file and then looking at correlations between the blood test data with the diet data and then trying to optimize the blood biomarkers by using my diet so since april of 2015 since i started that over 28 tests we can see that my average aging.ai age is 29.8 years so interestingly for 2022 we can see that the first measurement was 26 which is about four years younger than my average over that uh seven around seven year period and then similarly for the last test it was 28 which is still about two years younger than that about 30-year average over these 28 blood tests so uh so so far in 2022 that three-year reduction uh also off to a good start when looking at aging.ai data all right so how am i doing this so what's contributing to the 13.7 year reduction using levine's test and 21.1 year reduction using aging.ai what what's my diet what was the diet composition that corresponds to this test what's my cardiovascular fitness metrics what do they look like so heart rate variability resting heart rate and what about supplements what am i taking uh so i'll include that data in two upcoming videos i'm gonna split all that it's a lot of information it's gonna so i'm gonna split it into two videos uh probably the cv uh fitness data will be first with the supplements so stay tuned for that all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
