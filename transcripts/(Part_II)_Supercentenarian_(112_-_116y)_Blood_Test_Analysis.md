# (Part II) Supercentenarian (112 - 116y) Blood Test Analysis

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Was a super centenarian who lived until he was 116 years old now in an earlier video we looked at jirahiman's blood test data for the last four years of his life and we identified which biomarkers were good and which biomarkers were not good now that was part one and note that there's more blood test data in that was published in that paper so let's have a look so correspondingly this will be part two of drama durahimon khmer's blood test analysis from when he was 112 through 116 years old so which biomarkers will they cover well they include the 10 biomarkers here uric acid total protein four markers of liver function hemoglobin hematocrit platelets and total cholesterol so starting with three data points so when jorahiman was 111 and a half years old 113.3 years old and 115.7 years old we'll identify what was good or what appears to be good and what was bad so unfortunately in this video most of it is going to be biomarker data that was going in the wrong direction rather than right so starting from the top uric acid let's put this jarahiman's data into context so here we're looking at the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality plotted on the y-axis against the concentration of uric acid and we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk is when uric acid is 303 micromolar or 5.09 milligrams per deciliter so when taking jarajiman's average value over three blood tests his average uh uric acid was 263 and a half micromolar or 4.43 milligrams per deciliter and we can see that his data is not far from the lowest all-cause mortality risk for the association with uric acid so from this we can conclude that his uric acid data is close to optimal now as an interesting aside note that uric acid accumulates when kidney function is impaired or sub-optimal and in part one we saw that jarahiman had sub-optimal kidney function as indicated by elevated cyst systatin c and blood urea nitrogen bond so an important question to ask would be why isn't uric acid correspondingly increase when considering that he may have had sub-optimal kidney function so one possibility is that he may have had a relatively low intake of dietary precursors that can be degraded to form uric acid but note that there are no published studies that exist for his usual dietary intake to verify that hypothesis all right moving along total protein so total protein levels declined during aging for both men and women uh the data for men in green and the data for women in in blue and note that i'm only going to go over the data for men as it directly applies to jirahiman so 20 year olds have total protein levels in blood of about 7.4 grams per deciliter and then they decline during aging such that 90 year olds or older have total protein levels less than 6.6 so when we look at jarahiman's average total protein levels we can see that he's somewhere in the middle uh somewhere close to around 60 years old based on his average total protein of 7.07 grams per deciliter now superficially that seems pretty good because he was 116 or in the 112-116 range over these three blood tests so he's at least 50 years younger based on his total protein levels but note that total protein equals albumin plus globulin and in in part one we saw that jarahiman had aged and unhealthy levels of albumin now when we subtract albumin from total protein that equals globulin which is also known as the gamma gap so we can do that here and calculate jarahiman's globulin or his gamma gap and get the values there of 3 2 4.0 and 4 grams per deciliter so let's put that data into context so here we're looking at survival probability or all-cause mortality risk plotted on the y-axis against time after the baseline assessment of globulin or the gamma gamma gap so it was about a five-year follow-up after the baseline assessment of globulin levels so uh note that this study was in uh people who had an average age of 94 years which is relatively close to jirahiman's age you know 20 or so years but i'd expect that this data would be more relevant when comparing a study in 50 year olds so what does the data show so for people that had a gamma gap again those are globulin levels less than 3.2 in blue or greater than uh 3.2 in red starting with the people who had relatively low globulin levels we can see that they had an average life expectancy or sorry a mean uh median survival when looking at 50 50 survival which is what the green line indicates of about 44 months from the baseline assessment however people that had higher globulin levels or a higher gamma gap live significantly shorter as shown there and note that uh the jarahiman's average globulin level or his gamma gap was 3.73 uh grams per deciliter which would put him on that red line for a significantly shorter uh life expectancy after the baseline assessment when compared with people who who had a lower gamma gap so relatively high globulin as evidenced by the gamma gap and low albumin reflect the bad for health phenotype so all the total protein may have looked uh 50 years younger superficially when we investigate deeper when we investigate further we see that uh his albumin globulin levels were not optimal far in fact far from optimal so moving along we're going to look at four mark four markers of liver function god gpt gamma gtp and cholinesterase so starting with god god stands for glutamate oxaloacetate transferase and that's also commonly known as aspartate aminotransferase ast so let's put his data into context so here is all cost mortality data for got or ast and we've got it in four quartiles uh with uh lowest lowest risk uh for people who had ast or got in the 21 to 23 range when compared with the referent which was a median value of 20. So jarahiman's data was 29 for average data for for god and based on that that would put him in quartile four with which had a median value of 27 which would indicate he had a significantly all-cause mortality risk based on his got data so his uh god got data is not good as it would be associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk all right what about gpt so gpt stands for glutamate pyruvate transferase and this is also more commonly known as alanine aminotransferase alt so let's put that data into context looking at all-cause mortality data for alt or gpt so uh jurajiman's average gpt was 14.7 and when compared with the reference or actually that would put him into the reference group that had a median value of 15. Now normally uh the reference or i shouldn't say normally but most often the reference is has the lowest risk for all-cause mortality but that's not the situation in this case as we can see q2 and q3 with median values of alt of 18 to 22 had a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk when compared with people who had alt values of 15. So uh that would indicate that jarrah had significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on his gpt levels now so so note that his gpt would also not be good or a little bit far from optimal now besides assessing all-cause mortality risk for got and gbt individual individually evaluating their ratio or you know got divided by gpt or ast divided by alt has value and that's what we've we can see here with average ast or alt over alt values of 1.9 1.9 and 2.1 at those three different data points over that four year period so let's put these data into perspective so here we're looking at survival rate on the y-axis or all-cause mortality risk for people who had a relatively low ast alt ratio in which case their their ratio was 1.02 their average ratio and that was compared against survival the survival rate for people who had a relatively high ast to alt ratio as shown there in red and their average ast to alt ratio was 1.83 so these two curves are significantly different in other words people who had a relatively lower ast to alt ratio had a lower risk for all-cause mortality when compared with the group that had a higher ast to alt ratio so note that jarachimon's average ast to alt ratio is 2.0 which would put him pretty close to the high ast to alt ratio group which also would put him at a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on his ratio so that data 2 is not good alright so moving along gamma gtp which is known as gamma glutamine transpeptidase and that's also more commonly known as gamma glutamine transferase or ggt so let's put that data into context by looking at all-cause mortality data which is shown there and in this case uh lower is better in terms of all-cause mortality risk with a median value of 12 in q1 being associated with lowest all-cost mortality risk and then risk significantly increases as ggt increases from the median value of 12. So jirachimon's average a gamma gtp ratio was 41 which would put him somewhere in between q3 and q4 which had median values of 32 and 58 nonetheless both are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so uh jirahiman's gamma gtp data is also not good unfortunate all right and then last for these four liver markers is cholinesterase now in contrast with these other markers that i've just presented which are commonly performed when one goes to their doctor for their annual physical on a blood test cholinesterase is not so let's uh dig a little deeper into what cholinesterase is so obviously it's a liver enzyme as i mentioned these are four liver enzymes and within the liver there are different liver cell types one of them being hepatocytes which is zoomed in in that circle so cholinesterase is an enzyme that's produced within hepatocytes and when liver function is reduced less cholinesterase is made and then released into the blood so note that cholinesterase declines during aging which is shown here from the age range of about 50 to more than 110 years old so when looking at jarahiman's well and you can see the clear age-related decline with that red arrow so when looking at jirahiman's average cholinesterase data of about 199 international units per liter that would put him at extra by extrapolation somewhere close to the 110 year old uh data point which is pretty close to his actual chronological age so from this we conclude that that jirahiman had had aged and not youthful levels of cholinesterase so what about all-cause mortality risk and that's what's shown here in data from the same study and note that all of these studies if you're interested in checking out the papers they'll be linked in the description box for the video so here we can see that having a relatively higher level of cholinesterase is significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk as you can see the confidence interval the data in parentheses is completely below one which indicates lower all-cause mortality risk with a higher level of cholinesterase however jurajiman has relatively low levels of cholinesterase so this would put him at an increased all-cause mortality risk so based on that we can see that collectively these four markers of liver function jurajiman's liver health slash function and or function was sub-optimal and potentially poor all right so moving along hemoglobin we can see his three data there 11.6 12.8 and 12.0 and let's put his data into context so here we're looking at all-cause mortality in men and note that for each of these data that i present in the video i go after the largest studies that are representative of the majority of studies as i do deep dives you know i don't just look at one paper i look at as many papers that exist for a given biomarker as possible and then present the data for the largest study that exists on that given biomarker now in case i missed a study feel free to leave it in the comments and i'll i'd be glad to give you a shout out and and present that data in a future video so here for hemoglobin when compared well actually jurajiman's average hemoglobin level is 12.1 grams per deciliter so when compared with the reference which was 14 to 14.9 we we can see that duraimon is at a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on his hemoglobin level so that would indicate that his hemoglobin levels unfortunately are not good all right what about hematocrit so hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells rbcs that are present in blood in blood and in part one of this video series we saw that jarahiman had had aged and not youthful levels of red blood cells so it shouldn't be a surprise that his hematocrit is also relatively low nonetheless let's put his hematocrit data into perspective by looking at all cause mortality data which is shown here so all cost mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the uh percentage of hematocrit on the x-axis so as we can see lowest all-cause mortality risk is when hematocrit is 43.5 uh percent and jiraiman's data is 37.7 which although it isn't too far it's definitely going in the wrong direction so from that we can conclude that his hematocrit was suboptimal note that his if his hematocrit was somewhere around 30 it would be even worse uh but nonetheless it isn't it isn't great it's not as good as uric acid which is relatively closer to the lowest risk for all-cause mortality when compared with hematocrit all right next up are platelets so note that platelets decline during aging again this is data in men it's a study of 200 more than 230 000 men so starting from the age range of 20 to 30 years all the way through 90 to 100 years we can see that platelets which start off in about the 230 range up until about uh 50 to 60 they then decline after that with values approaching less than 210 so approaching 200 as you approach about 100 years old so note that this is up to 100 years old so it isn't a far stretch to expect that platelets would further continue to decline which would be one potential explanation for jarahiman's average uh platelets sorry that's a that's a mistake there it should be drawing on average platelets at 173.7 000 uh platelets per microliter now note that the units for the data for platelets are 18.8 16 and 17.3 so if we multiply that data by 100 we get 188 times 10 to the three platelets per microliter in case you wanted we're wondering why the data looks uh different in terms of the units all right so let's put his his platelet data into perspective for all-cause mortality risk which is shown there so in this study of more than 131 000 people when compared with people who had platelets in the 200 to 300 range which was defined as the reference we can see that people who had uh platelets in the 100 to 200 range which jarahimon does they had a significantly all-cause for mortality risk uh in the multi-uh uh multivariate adjusted model and in the crude unadjusted model that's shown but by the 25 increased all-cause mortality risk there too so nonetheless increased all-cause mortality risk for platelets based on jurajiman's platelet data so for that we can conclude that his platelets they were aged not youthful and unhealthy based on the all-cause mortality data all right next up and last but not least total cholesterol so in part one we saw that jarahiman's hdl and vldl which can be calculated simply by dividing uh or a very close approximation by dividing triglycerides by five hdl and vldl were among the what's good list for biomarkers in part one now note that total cholesterol equals hdl plus vldl plus lvl so this could potentially be a mostly ldl story and i'll have more on that uh coming up in a bit so let's look at this with let's look at the all-cause mortality data first and then look at the aging data second so here we're looking at all cost mortality data for total cholesterol and this is in uh people who are 75 to 99 years again i was trying to look at a representative data for an age group that was as close to jarahiman's age group as possible so when looking at jurajiman's average total cholesterol of 153 milligrams per deciliter as indicated there we can see that that's uh significantly associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with relatively higher total cholesterol which in this case was uh lowest risk of uh with for people who had total cholesterol in the 200 to 229 milligram per deciliter range so uh from that we can conclude that he jirahiman had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on his uh total cholesterol data so let's look at have a look at the aging data how does total cholesterol change during aging and that's what's shown here all the way up through 88 year olds and this is in a study of 12.8 more than 12.8 million million people so total cholesterol increases during aging for both men in green and women in red as shown there up until about 50 years so it goes from about 160 to 200 up until 50 in men and then after the age 50 uh it declines all the way to about 180 now note that jirachimon's total cholesterol was had an average of 153 so it may not be a far stretch to think that his total cholesterol levels may have been higher in youth and then continued to decline after 88 in this uh data here to his 153 for the last four years of his life so that's what stated there was his uh was to rajiman's total cholesterol relatively high but then declined until reaching 116 years so that's one possibility alternatively also note that relatively lower total cholesterol somewhere around 160 in men were people who were younger than 20 around 18 years old lower total cholesterol is also found in youth so another question that we can ask is is jirai human's total cholesterol of 153 that average value over three years indicative of youth so we can assess that by looking at data for albumin and hdl and that's what's shown here albumin and hdl can be used to further evaluate all-cause mortality risk when total cholesterol is less than 160 milligrams per deciliter so first starting off in and note that all four of these data are in people who have total cholesterol lower than 160. So starting within that group and granted this is a very small uh group it's only 393 subjects there isn't a lot of published data on this on this subject at least in terms of all cause mortality risk total cholesterol lower than 160 and then other biomarkers in assessing whether that uh that low total cholesterol may be neutral beneficial or detrimental for health so in this relatively small study and again if anybody's come across a bigger study that uh tried to stratify all cause mortality risk and people who had lower uh total cholesterol please post it in the comments uh please please share that data so for starting with people who had a total class of less than 160 relatively low albumin of 38 grams per deciliter and relatively low hdl of 47 milligrams per deciliter that was defined as the reference starting on the left and then for people who had high hdl but also relatively low albumin and low total cholesterol all-cause mortality risk was similar to people who also had low hdl so hdl didn't impact uh all-cause mortality risk for people who had uh low relatively low total cholesterol less than 160. But what happens when those people had relatively higher albumin and now we can see a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk for people who have low total cholesterol less than 160 relatively high albumin of greater than 38 grams per deciliter but then also relatively low hdl so in this case say 32 reduced all-cause mortality risk when compared with someone who has a low total cholesterol low albumin and low hdl but even better are people that have low total cholesterol relatively high albumin and relatively high hdl higher than 47 is shown there there's a 62 reduced all-cause mortality risk when compared with people who have low total cholesterol low albumin and low hdl now these data can be more easily simplified by looking at a flow chart here so starting with low total cholesterol at the top and in jarahiman's case he did have low total cholesterol with an average of 153 milligrams per deciliter and then taking it from there did he have low albumin or high albumin relatively high albumin in his case he had relatively low albumin with an average data of 3.3 grams per deciliter that should be deciliter uh sorry that's that's correct that you those units are correct 3.3 grams per liter for albumin so that would put him at at highest risk for all-cause mortality based on his albumen and total cholesterol data note that uh if if he had high albumin but and then correspondingly either low or high hdl we could then look at intermediate risk and low risk but that's not the case in gerarhiman's data so in his case his relatively low total cholesterol in combination with low abdomen but high hdl may not be indicative of youth but an increased all-cause mortality risk so as a summary for part two i we identified what may have been good uric acid but then there was a lot going in the wrong direction in terms of uh jarahiman's blood biomarkers now when considering in part one as i showed that his glucose hba1c hdl triglycerides white blood cells and crp were in the what's or crp at least for the first data point when he was 111.5 years old we're in the what's good uh category it highlights a potentially important role for these biomarkers on longevity especially when considering that he had a multitude of not good biomarkers of kidney liver red blood cells and red blood cell related measures including hemoglobin and hematocrit platelets and total cholesterol now if you read the paper you'll notice that only one biomarker is missing from the 22 that were that were published and that's ldl and that's because in a very recently published paper which is shown here they stratified cardiovascular disease risk based on ldl levels and glucose levels which may contribute to identifying when relatively low ldl in jorahiman's case would be associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk or mortality from cardiovascular disease or not so i'm probably going to make a future video about that so stay tuned for that alright that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
