Tea consumption is associated with slower biological aging and that's what we'll see in this recently published paper which will be in the video's description so first which tea it included consumption of white tea green tea yellow tea oong tea black tea dark tea sweet tea or unscented so any combination of all these teas was associated with biological aging in two cohort studies so let's jump right into the data so the first study was the china multi ethnic cohort or cmech which included about 8,000 people that had a median age of 51 years and then in taking a look at the data on the x- axis we've got tea consumption in cups per day and on the y- axis we've got kdm or chamera dubal uh method which the kdm method which is basically a compilation of many biomarkers into a biological ag metric and i'll have more on that in a bit so kdm biological age acceleration ba acceler acceleration ba acceleration is whether biological age is higher or lower than chronological age so the pure definition of ba acceleration would be having an a biological age that's older than one's chronological age so when comparing consistent non-drinkers and putting up a red line at a biological age of zero a biological age acceleration of zero we can see that people who reported drinking less than one cup of tea any of those teas combined per day uh the biological age acceleration was similar to non-drinkers however for the people who reported 2 to three and greater than four cups of tea per day we can see that they had a slower biological age uh acceleration over the course of the study so data in one study is nice but replication or cross studies can add strength to confirm or deny findings from one study so they then looked at associations in a second study ukb or uk biobank this study included about about 6,000 people that had a median age of 59 years and using the same approach where we've got kdm biological age acceleration on the y- axis plotted against tea consumption and when compared with non-drinkers or consistent non-drinkers once again we can see that people who reported drinking less than one cup of tea per day had a similar biological age acceleration to the consistent non-drinkers but for people who reported drinking 2 to three cups of tea per day that they had a slower biological age acceleration over the course of the study just like in the cmec study and unfortunately or what the data shows is for people who reported drinking greater than four cups of uh of tea per day you can see that the 95% confidence interval which is that vertical line above the square vertical uh line above and below the square it overlap with a biological age acceleration of zero so that's not a significant association so what we can see from these two studies is that 2 to 3 cups a day of tea was consistently associated with a slower biological age acceleration over the course of the study and more specifically in the paper they also showed that 6 to8 g of t in terms of actual weight was associated with this slowing of biological age acceleration that data too is in the is in the paper all right but these data introduce more questions for example how good or not is this biological age metric because if the metric isn't very good in terms of its correlation with chronological age or its association with all cause or cause specific mortality then who cares what these associations show second is this just healthy you user bias in other words people who report drinking 2 to three cups of tea per day are they more likely to have an overall healthy lifestyle relative to consistent non-drinkers and then third which biomarkers were included in this biological age metric how many different organ systems are represented so these are important questions to be asked for for this study so first let's start off with how good or not is this biological age metric so here we'll see that both cmech and ukb uh derived biological age was correlated with chronological age so on the left we've got the cac data on the right we've got data for the uk biobank on the y-axis we've got biological age plotted against chronological age on the x and here we can see that there are linear correlations for biological age with chronological age in both these studies so it's we're off to a good start now unfortunately they didn't report the actual correlation coefficient and that's important because we want to know how strong this correlation with chronological age is for their biological age acceleration metric but we can compare it at least visually to dr morgan lavine's pheno ag which is what we can see here with biological age as indicated by phenotypic age on the y- axis plotted against chronological age on the x and here we know that the correlation for lavine's phenotypic age or biological age with chronological age is very strong almost perfectly linear with a correlation c coefficient as indicated in green of 0.96 note that a correlation coefficient of 1.0 is perfectly linear so this is as close to uh as close to a test can get outside of the horvath test for its prediction of chronological age nonetheless when looking at these uh this the cac data and the ukb uh biobank data at least visually we can see that the yellow lines the slope of the yellow lines are in the same ballpark as dr morgan lavine's pheno ag so we can see that it's of a similar strength that correlation for biological age with chronological age in the cmech and ukb studies are in a similar ballpark to phenoage without knowing what the actual correlation is all right so what about all cause and cause specific mortality so we're about to see that an older biological age is significantly associated with an increased all cause and cause specific mortality risk so first taking a look at the data in uk biobank this is all cause mortality risk we're looking at data for model 2 fully adjusted model and i'll get into which variables that they included in this model in a second to assess healthy user bias and then we're looking at the total uh number of participants including data for men and women and then data for women and men separately so these are all the dat data we're about to see and then in terms of biological age as a uh biological age acceleration as a continuous variable in other words for people that had biological ages that were older than their chronological age what was the association with all cause mortality risk so in the full cohort we can see that the hazard ratio is above one especially the data in parenthesis the 95% confidence interval of both of those the data to the left and to the right of the comma are above one which indicates a significant association with all cause mortality risk in other words biological age acceleration as a continuous variable older than one's chronological age was significantly associated with a 56% higher risk for all cause mortality an effect that was significant in both women 46% and men 60% all right so what about in the cex study well unfortunately they didn't show all cause mortality data but they did show cause specific mortality data first starting off with deaths from cardiovascular disease cvd and using the same approach biological age acceleration as a continuous variable we can see that that was associated with a or significantly associated with a 10% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease in the full cohort 133% higher in women 9% significantly higher in in men significant in women too uh it was bi an older biological age relative to chronological age was also significant associated with a higher risk for diabetes related mortality 15% in the total cohort 18% in women 15% in men and once again note the 95% confidence interval for each of these are above one indicating a significant association it was also associated with an increased risk for uh deaths from lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmon p pulmonary sorry hard to say pulmonary disease so copd and you can see that these are small but significant effects in the total cohort 3% just on the borderline of significant as 1.0 overlaps with the hazard ratio of one so not significant in women but significant in men and the in the cx study cancer mortality was not significantly associated with biological age acceleration as you can see that the 95% confidence interval 99 to 1.02 overlaps with one not significant and it was also not significant in women or men so here we can see that an older biological age using the biological age metric in the cmech and uk biobank studies was associated with an increased all cause mortality and cause specific mortality so it's a pretty good pretty good metric all right so what about uh healthy user bias what factors did they adjust in the models what what what factors did they include in the models to potentially account for this and that's what's shown here and i won't go through all of them but you can see they adjusted for many variables which is important you want to have as many variables as possible that could possibly confound the association between tea consumption with mortality risk or cause specific mortality if there is a weakness in terms of which variables they should have adjusted for but didn't if we take a look at physician diagnosed chronic diseases it's good that they adjusted for cancer cbd diabetes and copd mortality but it's important to also adjust for other things that could potentially kill us like liver disease kidney disease uh alzheimer's disease these were not adjusted for so they adjusted for almost everything that can be involved with healthy user bias but there are still a few that could have been included into the models all right so which biomarkers were included because we want to have a tool that can look at many different biomarkers of many different organ systems so let's start off with the biomarkers in cmech in the cmech study which which are shown here on the left we've got the biomarkers uh and then in the middle we've got their correlation with chronological age and note that a positive correlation means that the biomarker increases during aging a negative correlation means that the biomarker decreases during aging and then the p value or their p value for the cor their correlation with chronological age and we can see that for each of these 15 biomarkers they are significantly associated with chronological age and we included in the biological age acceleration metric for the c study so note that biomarkers of many organ systems were included for biological age assessment so let's go through which organ systems were were covered so first systolic blood pressure or vascular health waste to hip ratio is a me measure of adiposity peak expiratory flow as a measure of lung function and then metabolic health including hba1c glycated hemoglobin but also ldl triglycerides hdl uh four markers of liver health ggt or or gamma glutamil transpeptidase albumin aspartate amino transferase or a and alkaline phosphatase mcv mean corpuscular volume for red blood cell size platelet count is one metric of immune function but platelets have many different functions in the body including blood clotting and then two markers of kidney function including ura and creatinine now ideally for replication for biological age tools across studies you want to have the same biomarker panel in cmech and in uk biobank unfortunately that not always possible because every study doesn't measure the same biomarkers so which biomarkers were used for the biological age acceleration tool in uk biobank and that's what we can see here so using the same setup their correlation with chronological age in the middle and then the p value on the right and in the blue arrows we can see that there is a lot of overlap which is good news for the biomarkers in uk biobank so i won't go through their organ systems or which organ systems that they cover but new or or newly included ined biomarkers that were in uk biobank but were not in cmech included body fat percentage but that can be linked with the waist to hip ratio too the heelal quantitative ultrasound index as a measure of fracture risk so that's a new one that wasn't in cmec and along those lines vitamin d can be linked with bone health so we've got two measures of bone or related to bone in uk bank that were not in cmech catin c and uric acid or urate as measures of kidney function forc expiratory volume in 1 second or f v1 is a measure of lung function and if you if that sounds familiar that's because that's one of the biomarkers that i track regularly um and i haven't made an update video but that should be coming sometime soon c reactive protein as a measure of inflammation which shouldn't be a surprise mentioned it many times on the channel igf1 is a measure of liver health but it's also involved in many metabolic processes so in some we can see that each of these 18 biomarkers in the case of uk biobank was significant correlated with chronological age and hence went into the biological age acceleration tool that was us used for uk biobank so to summarize tea consumption 2 to three cups per day were was associated with a slower biological age acceleration or across two different studies using a biological age acceleration tool or biological age metric that included biomarkers of many different organ systems which is good news those biological age tools or biological age metric was strongly correlated with chronological age and it was associated with all cause and cause specific mortality thereby highlighting its potential utility and usefulness as it was associated with chronological age and risk of death for all causes all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you be may be interested in including discount links for green tea which is where i get my daily tea consumption epigenetic and tm testing any quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob note that those are complimentary tests there isn't much overlap diet tracking or if you' like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die tring brand as i' i've got on here that link and all the other links will be
