Brain morphology changes in alzheimer's disease when compared with the healthy brain we can see that the brain in severe alzheimer's disease has a different size structure and obviously function so with that in mind are there plasma biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases and that's what we'll see here ameloid plaques are characteristic of alzheimer's disease louis bodies are characteristic of parkinson's disease and tal tangles are found in alzheimer's but also huntington's disease and other neuro generative diseases but what about plasma biomarkers of amalo plaques t tangles and other aspects of neurod degenerative disease so first the a beta 42 divided by the a beta 40 ratio and note that there's a typo in this picture this picture isn't mine i'll link to the paper that it came from in the video's description it should be the a beta 42 divided by the a beta 40 ratio plasma levels of these two proteins are a biomarker of ameloid plaques that are found in the brain phosphorated levels of tow or p to is a plasma biomarker of tow tangles found in the brain gat otherwise known as gal fibrillary acidic protein is a plasma biomarker of neuroinflammation and nfl or neurofilament like chain protein is a plasma biomarker of neurodegeneration all right so can we measure these can we measure these on our own unfortunately price may exclude at at least the a a beta42 to a a beta 40 ratio as just two biomarkers more than $1,200 outrageous and for the other three that i mentioned they are not commercially available at least not in the united states if these plasma biomarkers are available where you live post it in the comments as i'm curious uh where it might be available but the good news is we may be able to indirectly track these biomarkers plasma biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease and that's by using the kind youry to tryp thean ratio which is associated with phosphorated levels of to gap and nfl and that's what we'll see here so this is a relatively small study of 30178 year olds on the x-axis we've got phosphorated levels of to nfl and gap and on the y- axis we've got plasma levels of the curine to trip the fan ratio and for each of these plasma biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease we can see significant positive associ ations as the p value is less than 0.05 in other words a relatively higher curine to trip the fan ratio is significant associated with higher levels of biomarkers of neurod degeneration so let's take a step back what is the kind year need to trip the fan ratio so under normal conditions under non-immune activated conditions for example in the liver the amino acid tryptophan is converted into cine by action of the enzyme tdo tryptophan dioxy oase and that pathway is on the road to making nad that's the day noo nad synthesis pathway which starts at trypan and through a series of steps going through curine leads to any production in the liver as an example but in the presence of immune activation for example by pro-inflammatory cyto kindes interferon ifn alpha beta and gamma or tnf alpha and the bacterial outer membrane metabolite lipopolysaccharide l ps they induce idio indolamine uh dioxygenase which converts tryptophan into curine so in the presence of immune activation and inflammation ido is expressed leading to an inre increased degradation of tryptophan into curine thereby increasing the kine to tryp theen ratio but on the other hand there are also anti-inflammatory pyocin or anti-inflammatory proteins like interlukin 10 il10 il4 and the super uh the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase sod which inhibit ido1 uh expression so taken together the k to trip thean ratio is an integrated measure of many pro and anti-inflammatory inputs and as it's also a measure it can be in part a measure of antioxidant defense especially when considering superoxide dismutase inhibits id1 expression now the good news is that the cur trip thean ratio can be tracked and if it can be tracked we can potentially optimize it with the goal of minimizing inflammation of maximizing antioxidant defense and potentially limiting those plasma biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases and to do that i've been using iolo's atome metabol metabolomics kit which includes plasma levels of curine and tryptophan but also 600 other metabolites including many that i've covered on the channel and if you missed any of those videos i'll link to the metabolomics playlist in the right corner if you want to measure kanur need to trip thean in all these metabolites on your own discount link in the video's description so what's my data so i currently have 10 tests for the plasma curing to trip the fan ratio as shown here and on the y- axis we've got the ktr or canning to trip the fan ratio plotted against time in 2023 over five tests the average ktr was 24 which then raises the question what's optimal for the kanur to trip the fan ratio and i cover that too in an earlier video i'll link to that too it'll be in the right corner if you missed it check it out and in that video we saw that 15 to 23 for the ker trip defend ratio is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk so 24 is just outside that and if there is good news for 2023 data is that values greater than 25 are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so 24 as the average value in 2023 isn't the best it's not quote unquote optimal it's not in that optimal range for lowest risk but it's also not in the zone for increased risk so it's somewhat in the middle or it was somewhat in the middle in terms of what's optimal also avoiding an age related increase as this ratio kureo tryp thean ratio increases during aging so with that in mind i have five tests currently i'm waiting on another test uh for july five tests in 2024 and over those five tests the average kanur need to trip def fan ratio is 22.5 now that's in the 15 to 23 lowest all cause mortality risk and at least over this relatively short period about a year or so i've avoided any significant increase from 24 actually going in the right direction to 22.5 but the goal is to keep it relatively low to keep to minimize risk in terms of neurodegenerative disease biomarkers increasing during aging and to minimize inflammation and to minimize oxidative stress so how can how can i do that and to address that which foods and nutrients are correlated with the kinding n tropen ratio and those data are on patreon in the correlations tier so if you're interested in that check it out all right that's all for now if you're interested in
