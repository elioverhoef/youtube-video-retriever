Resting heart rate heart rate variability first quarter of 2023 update are these data better than in 2022 more specifically is the resting heart rate further reduced and is heart rate variability increased now for perspective let's see how resting heart rate and heart rate variability change during aging before addressing these questions so let's start off with age-related changes for the resting heart rate so on the y-axis we've got the resting heart rate plotted against age and this is whoops data as that's what i wear i'm not affiliated and i'm not here to sponsor them so we can see that using whoops data resting heart rate increases for both men and women up to 50 years of age what about older than 50 years so for that we've got to go to fitbit data and this is a study of about 90 000 people once again on the y-axis we've got the average resting heart rate plotted against age but in this case the age range goes from 20 to 85 years and in agreement with whoops data we can see that the resting heart rate increase increases for both men and women up to about 50 years and then declines thereafter up until 85 years so with that in mind relatively low resting heart rates are found in both young and people of advanced age so how would we know if a relatively low resting heart rate was indicative of youth or aging that's where heart rate variability comes in as that provides more context so what is heart rate variability so in terms of definition it's the variability for the time in between heartbeats which still may not be intuitive but for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute the assumption is that the heart beats exactly once per second and that's not exactly true so here we can see the time in between three consecutive heartbeats and the time in between each of these heartbeats is not exactly the same and the variability in that data is then calculated as heart rate variability or more specifically in this case as the rmssd or the root mean squared of successive differences so with that in mind let's take a look at how heart rate variability changes during eight and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got the rmssd as the metric of heart rate variability plotted against age and in this case the age range goes from 20 to 60 years now note that there are two line graphs on this chart solids and dashed the solids are hrv at six in the morning and the dashes are heart rate variability at six at night so for every age group note that heart rate variability in the morning is always higher at least median values when compared with nighttime either way we can see that heart rate variability declines during aging with values approaching 80 in youth and 20 year olds median values to values about half that in 60 year olds and if we extrapolated the curve further and i covered this in earlier videos if we go beyond 60 years heart rate variability would continue to decrease so now that we know how heart rate variability changes during aging we can address that question is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so in younger ages we can see that there is a low resting heart rate but a high heart rate variability in contrast at older ages we can see that there are low resting heart rates but also low heart rate variability now we can go back to our question our initial question of is first quarter 2023 data for heart rate variability and resting heart rate improved versus 2022. So first we're going to take a look at the average yearly resting heart rate and i first started tracking on august 5th of 2018 and this is through the first three months of 2023 march 31st of 2023 and i now have very close to 1700 days of data over that time spent and that's what we can see here now i won't go through year by year changes from 2018 to 2022. I covered that in earlier videos and if you missed that i'll put at least one of them in the right corner what we want to know is is the first quarter of 2023 better than 2022 data and thus far in 2023 my average resting heart rate is 44.4 beats per minute and we're using a two sample t-test to compare 2023 verse 2022 that data is significantly reduced so i've further reduced resting heart rate again in 2023 when compared with 2022. Now also note that the resting heart rate in 2023 is lower significantly lower than where i started in 2018 50.9 beats per minute so reducing one's resting heart rate is indeed possible now is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging though so to refresh your memory remember a relatively low resting heart rate can be found in youth but also in advanced age so am i just experiencing the age-related decline for resting heart rate so for more context let's have a look at heart rate variability and this data is over that same time span almost 1700 days of data and again i won't go through the 2018 to 2022 heart rate variability changes as i covered that in earlier videos thus far in 2023 the average heart rate variability is 62.1 milliseconds which when using a two-sample t-test when compared with 2022 is significantly higher so i've significantly increased my heart rate variability thus far in 2023 when compared with 2022 also note that 2023 data is significantly higher when compared with where i started in 2018 from 47 up to 62. So increasing one's heart rate variability is also possible doesn't have to be an age-related decline at least not yet so now we can address the question of is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging in my case a relatively higher heart rate variability plus lower resting heart rate with average values of 62 and about 44 or 44.4 to be exact would be relatively useful and i say that because a lower heart rate variability plus a higher resting heart rate 35 heart rate variability 57 for resting heart rate is expected based on my chronological age at least based on the graphs that i presented in this video now what's contributing to improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability in 2023 and i carved some of this in my last video including balancing activity versus rest making sure i'm not over trained but also body weight reduction and more specifically getting leaner in terms of body fat so i won't go into that in this video i'll cover that in a future video as i'll dedicate it just to those two topics so we can really take a deep dive all right that's all for now if you're interested in more of my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all these links will be in the video's description in addition to a link for conquer aging or die trying merch thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
