# 6y Younger Horvath Epigenetic Age: My Best Data Yet (16-Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age is the horvath clock and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got dna m ag or dna methylation age otherwise known as epigenetic age plotted against chronological age on the x and this is from birth through 100 years old but note that there are a lot of different colored circles on this plot this is a multicell and tissue clock so many different cell types and tissue types were used to derive these uh this correlation in terms of that correlation it's almost perfectly linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 note that in this case a positive correlation a perfectly linear correlation would be a correlation coefficient of 1.0 so horvath's correlation with chronological age of 0.94 is as close to as good as it can get for its correlation with chronological age and in terms of statistical significance you can see next to that is the p value at 1 * 10 -200 far below the statistical significance threshold of less than 0.05 now a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and biological age metrics are obviously included on that list including horvath so with that in mind what's my data as i now have 16 tests which is what we'll see here so when i first started testing in 2022 average horvath age was 55 years which when compared with my chronological age was 6 years older not not 6 years younger like or or more like pheno age but older 6 years older than my chronological age of 49 years so it should be pretty clear at least based on those first three tests that horvat's epigenetic age is a weak spot and that is relatively continued over the past two years or so now three tests though over a one-year period 2022 may not be enough for a full year average so to see if 55 was representative of my full year average i then tested more often in 2023 testing eight times and there we can see that my horvath epigenetic age was 52.8 years a bit better and moving in the right direction as it's only 3 years older than my chronological at that time still it's it's not great it's in the wrong direction and in terms of how does this how do how do i rationalize this with pheno ag being 17 years or so younger for every test i'll describe that in the testing in a testing hierarchy video coming sometime soon all right so what about in 2024 i currently have five tests which is what we can see there and the average horvath epigenetic age is 53.3 years about the same as where it was in 2022 but now only 2 years older than my chronological so there has been some progress in keeping horvath's uh epigenetic age from you know going crazy not not too far away from my chronological age but i should mention there is reason for optimism and that's because of my last test and if you saw the the the title of the video it was my best data yet so for the july test july 26 that's the most recent test uh that was 45.7 for horvath and that's by far my best data ever and note that uh just like tiir length and many other biomarkers horvath's epigenetic age increases with chronological age so that i could reduce it to six years around six years younger than my chronological uh after 16 tests to me seems like an unlikely event now that's said there are some caveats and the first is why wasn't my why isn't my current 2024 average of 53.3 years why isn't that lower when i had a 45.7 year right so for the two previous tests it was 58 so at this point in the video i could proclaim i've reduced my epigenetic age by 12 years technically that's true but if we look at the full year averages not so much and then it also raises a couple of questions is there just a lot of variability in this test i mean a 12year swing is a wide range i don't see that anywhere near that wide of a range for pheno for example or other biomarkers so it's possible that this test has a lot of variability inherent in its testt test measurement so that's one caveat the other is that i might have done something to discover the recipe to finally keep it lower than my chronological age so with that in mind what's the recipe or what might be the recipe for a relatively youthful horath epigenetic age so to start with that story let's take a look at correlations following test number 15 this is after the may test not the july test so after every test i calculate correlations with diet and supplements fitness metrics sleep everything you can think of which is what we'll see here so to the right we've got the p value as the measure of statistical significance and note that each of these nine foods or nutrients on the list has a p value less than 0.05 and this is the partial list the full list is on the correlations tier on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out in terms of the correlation we've got the lowercase r that's the correlation coefficient and then in terms of what's on the list protein and total fat just to start relatively higher levels of protein and total fat are significantly or were significantly correlated with an older horvat's epigenetic age so that suggests that if i reduce my intake or when my intake for protein and total fat were towards the lower end of my intake range over the first five uh 15 tests that i had a relatively younger horvath epigenetic a all right so for total fat that doesn't tell us if it's omega-3 omega 6 sat fat monounsaturated etc but as we can see on the list saturated fatty acids were on uh were significantly and positively correlated with horas epigenetic age but that too doesn't say what does it coming from is it from meat is it from plants the majority of my sad fat comes from coconut butter and that too is on the list and a positive correlation so it looks like total fat sat fat and coconut butter may have a part in this story also on the list alala sprouts peanuts and trigonelline relatively higher intakes of those foods or nutrients were significantly correlated with an older epigenetic age in contrast cloves and cinnamon were inversely correlated so that suggests that when cloves and cinnamon were towards the higher end of my intake range over the first 15 tests that was correlated with a younger horath epigenetic age all right so what do i do with this information i have a list of correlations what do i do how do i actually put the data into to practice so for the positive correlations in this case i would reduce intake or keep them towards the lower end of the range so what does that look like so the total fat average prior to test 15 was 93 gam per day and that's not an approximation i weigh all my food using a food scale so for the 59-day period from the test in may to the test in july i averaged 10 g of fat less per day to 83 g per day so that follows the correlation because the correlation suggest that if i lower my fat intake that i could make a dent on horvath's epigenetic age and again these are correlations the only way i can test causation is by following the correlations and not just one trying to follow as many of the correlations at top the list as possible similarly i cut sat fat and from 22 22 grams per day prior to test number 15 to 14 gram per day for the 59-day period that corresponded to test number 16 and sad fat that cut came almost exclusively from coconut butter as i cut it from an average of 18 g per day prior to test 15 to an average of only 2 g per day prior to test number 16 so to the sat fat and the coconut butter correlations i'm following the correlations because that data suggests that i should go lower and that's what i did prior to test number 16 so what about the inverse correlations how do i follow that so inverse correlations suggest that i should increase intake in this case or keep it relatively high so for cloves which were 0 g per day i didn't eat it at all prior to test number 15 i increased it towards the higher end of my range which isn't that much4 g per day so i'm not actually measuring out 400 milligrams per day that's a couple of grams a couple of times per week and then similarly so that follows the correlation similarly cinn cinnamon was 0 grams per day prior to test number 15 i increased that to half a gram per day again 2 grs a couple of times per week and that too would be following the correlation as i increased it above where it was rel to the prior test but note that i didn't follow all of the correlations on this list and one of them is protein so the positive correlation for protein of 0.76 suggested that i should go lower for protein intake if that could make a dent with causation on horvath's epigenetic age but i increased it from 105 gram per day before test number 15 to2 g per day for the 59-day period from the may test to the july test so that did not follow the correlation nonetheless without going through everything else on the list i followed seven of the nine correlations following test number 15 so then if a food or nutrient is positively involved in horvath's epigenetic age or with any biomarker i use this same strategy for every biomarker its correlation over time will strengthen if not it will weaken so how did these correlations change following the july test so i recalculate correlations after every test how does the data look and that's what we'll see here now so 16 test correlations horat epigenetic age versus diet same setup on the right we've got the p value and note that all of the nine foods foods or nutrients on this list have the p value less than 0.05 in fact it's less than 0.03 full list again on patreon if you're interested in the correlations not just for this for but for all the biomarkers i look at all biomarker correlations with diet and other metrics so if you're interested in that check it out so then remember our premise if a food or nutrient is causely involved with horvath's epigenetic age or or any biomarker its correlation will strengthen over time if not it will weaken so what got stronger and what got weaker so first we can see that sat fat's correlation increased got stronger to 78 and that's up from 62 similarly coconut butter's correlation also strengthened 75 up from 0.54 and soda cloves up or actually more it's more negative in in the negative correlations if it gets closer to negative one that's getting stronger so cloves went from uh nega .62 toga .7 following test number 16 so that those three correlation strengthened would add support to the hypothesis that they may be involved in mechanisms that impact my horvat's epigenetic age now i can't say if that would be true for others but i would recommend using a similar approach of tracking diet and supplements and other other variables in conjunction with blood testing and then looking at correlations in your own data to see what the recipe is for you right it it may be the same as mine but it might be different too all right so also note that total fat though its correlation weakened so it went from 73 following test number 15 to 0.55 following test number 16 so that suggests it's not a total fat story or it might not be a total fat story in terms of horath epigenetic age it might be more specifically targeted to sad fat and sad fat coming from coconut butter but note that many of the correlations following test number 15 weaken so protein uh peanuts cinnamon and trigonelline they no longer in the top nine as we can see on the far right on the right following the correlations after test number 16 but now we've got a new medium you know middle list of correlations to follow so am i following those correlations for test number 17 and i should say before going into that with the goal of repeating or potentially trying to repeat the 45.7 result i i've purposely kept sat fat specifically from coconut butter low so two grams per day i've purposfully kept clothes relatively high i actually increased it by a little bit 04 to 05 gram whether that makes a dent a 10th you know 100 milligrams makes a dent on horvath i don't know but we'll see and total fat is again a bit lower at 81 gram per day relative to the 83 following test number 16 all right so what about the other ones that now popped up on the list am i following those correlations because the goal is to follow as many as possible because i can't presume that it's only two or three or four nutrients or foods that can impact a given biomarker i try to follow them all so starting from the top uh sardines actually were at my highest intake ever following test number 15 so i cut back on that because blood ur nitrogen and uric acid went in the wrong direction but when considering the horvath data i may go higher especially if i don't see 45.7 for horvath again maybe i see if i see 48 that would suggest that maybe sardines have a role in that uh recipe so with that in mind i will increase sardines following the next test i'm currently following correlations for copper and b5 those are positive correlations which which suggest that i should reduce my intake by a bit relative to the last test so i've reduced intake relative to the last test so that follows the correlation similarly for manganese that's an inverse correlation so i should go a little bit higher relative to the last test i've done that but i have not increased vitamin e as high as it was for the last test vitamin e was in part high because i had a high intake of broccoli sprouts and broccoli and this is a story for another day but that may have increased my nighttime respiratory rate and reduced my heart rate varability and increased increased my resting heart rate i already posted that story on patreon but that's a story for another day nonetheless not following the vitamin e correlation it's a bit a little bit lower than it was uh prior to this test nonetheless though i followed seven of the nine correlations for both following test 15 and test 16 will it work i just took that test two days ago those results take about 3 weeks to a month to come in so expect an update video for horvat's epigenetic age coming sometime in mid to late october all right that's all for now
