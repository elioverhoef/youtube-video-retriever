# Blood Test #7 in 2022: Diet Composition

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that my biological age for blood test number seven in 2022 was about 17 years younger than my chronological and that's using levine's biological age test pheno age similarly when looking at aging.ai it was about 22 years younger so with that in mind what's contributing to these data so first let's have a look at supplements so in terms of supplements i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early to mid 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine for about half of my life and then also in the winter for about eight to nine months out of the year i supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day and that's it for supplements no other supplements including geo protectors or xenolytics at least for this blood test now the story is going to be a bit different for the next blood test blood test number one in 2023 as i've been taking glycine since mid-december and an oral probiotic that's aimed at optimizing my oral microbiome so the supplement story will be a bit different for this corresponding video for blood test number one in 2023. So that brings us to to diet and more specifically what's the diet composition that corresponds to this blood test and we can see that here this is the average daily dietary intake that goes from the day of blood test number six to the day before blood test number seven so october 24th through december 11th of 2022 and for that 49 day period what we're looking at is the average diet average daily dietary intake for that 49 day period so first we've got seven foods that are consistently at the top of my list and i covered that in an earlier video the correlations are about the same so if you're interested in the why for the foods that are at the top of my list that video will be in the right corner what i want to highlight though is that my diet isn't always clean and that's purposefully done because if i completely eliminate junk food that'll set me up where i'm craving it all the time so i purposely intend a couple of days at the most to have some junk food so that it keeps me on track for the rest of the period so for this 49 day period that corresponds to test number seven in 2022 i had two separate cheat days and on those days i had cheesecake and also had candy which is known as mike and ike now if you look at the cheesecake that's about 25 calories on average per day for cheesecake so it was a big slice it was about 1200 calories of cheesecake that i had on a two in a two day period and for the mike and ice that's three grams an average of three grams per day so it was it was about 150 gram box or around 600 calories of candy so to put those two uh in put those two data into perspective in terms of calories the cheesecake and the candy contributed 1.7 percent of my total calories during this 49 day period that preceded uh test number seven or that corresponded to test number seven all right so then that brings us to macronutrients and micronutrients how do they correspond or what do they look like as they correspond to test number seven so let's start off with calorie protein and fat intake that corresponds to test number seven in 2022 so the average daily calorie intake was 22 35 calories per day and i should mention for those who don't know i weigh all my food with a food scale every day so these are not estimates these are as close as you can get to exact amounts now 22 35 calories per day is the lowest average daily calorie intake that i've had since starting since i started tracking diet in april of 2015. In terms of protein intake at the average daily protein intake was about 97 grams per day and to put that into perspective it's about 17.3 percent of total calories now as a last note on for protein intake 96.6 grams of protein per day equates to 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram body weight when considering that my body weight currently is about 68 kilograms so that's important because 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram body weight is on the ascending portion of the curve for optimizing muscle mass as a result of strength training which i consistently do and if you missed that video that too will be in the right corner all right so then that brings us to fat and we can see total fat and all of its individual components shown here and cholesterol so note that these data calorie intake protein intake and all the diet data is tracked with chronometer so after i weigh the food i entered that data into chronometer and then i put all of that data into an excel file and if you're interested in tracking your own diet there'll be a discount link to use chronometer in the video's description so in terms of total fat the average per day my average fat intake per day was about 83 grams or 82.8 grams per day and that's about a third of my total calories come from fat now if you're interested in the further breakdown monounsaturated polyunsaturated saturated and trans fats those are shown here so you can have a look if you're interested all right so then that brings us to carb intake and that's we can see here so starting from the top uh three 314 grams of carbs per day seems like a lot but note that net carbs equals carbs minus fiber so for this blood test the average daily fiber intake was about 87 grams per day and when subtracting that from carbs we get a net carbs of 228 about 228 grams of net carbs per day then we can calculate its percentage of total calories by multiplying net carbs by four calories per gram and then dividing the 914 cal calories that come from that by average daily calorie intake multiply that by 100 so we get 40.9 percent of my diet came from carbohydrates or net carbs now note that there's a glitch in chronometers carb counts and that's because when when considering that protein and fat were set about 17 and 33 percent of my total calories when we subtract that from 100 i should get 49.4 carbs so regardless if i start with carbs that with uh started start with 314 grams of carbs or 228 neither of those yield 49.4 percent carbs so if anyone else has come across this problem in chronometer please leave a comment or if anyone else uses a different diet tracking app that doesn't have this problem i'm happy to try something else out that may be better also if you leave a comment and indicate what you uh what you use so then in terms of carbs too i also track a total sugar intake and more specifically total fructose because i have a tendency to eat a lot of fruit i have a sweet tooth so i keep an eye on how much fructose because fruit is mostly comprised comprised of fructose so in terms of total fructose note that sucrose divided by two equals fructose because half of sucrose is fructose so when adding those two together i get a total fructose of about 59 grams per day now 59 grams of total fructose may seem like a lot but for me this is my lowest fructose intake since i started dietracking in 20 2015. So there is good news and there is progress on that front i've actually had doubled the intake close to 115 grams of fructose per day in the past so that i've cut that in half over time is a big big win all right so what about micronutrients in terms of vitamins and minerals so it may be hard to see but here's the full bite of vitamin list and and how much that i take in uh per day and note that i do have purposeful targets and more specifically those purposeful targets that i aim for are vitamin b3 or niacin beta-carotene and vitamin e so for me in my data niacin has a strong positive correlation with blood biomarkers meaning a lot more going in the right direction than wrong with a relatively higher intake of niacin so i aim for uh higher than 40 milligrams of niacin per day because based on that data higher may be better in my case conversely higher may not be better for beta-carotene and vitamin e which in my case are strongly negatively correlated with more biomarkers going blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i don't aim for my highest intake but i've been titrating those down to try to find the sweet spot where i'm not making more biomarkers worse than sending them in the right direction so for me beta-carotene around 50 000 micrograms which equals 50 milligrams per day and again this is from whole food and vitamin e at 20 milligrams but not higher note that the rda is 15 milligrams so i'm above the rda but not at my highest vitamin e intake which has been close to 30 milligrams per day and then last but not least we can see my mineral intake and all these are higher than the rda if you're interested in specific amounts i don't have purposeful targets here but i do try to follow the correlations uh as they correlate with blood biomarkers all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in in terms of epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and as i mentioned we do have merch so if you're interested in that that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
