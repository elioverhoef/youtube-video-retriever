# Albumin, CRP, and Creatinine: Better Markers Of Longevity Than Lipoproteins And Glycemic Status

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Albumin c react to protein and creatinine may be better markers of longevity than glycemic status and lipoproteins so let's take a look at that data so first who was in this study it included 531 85 to 99 year olds 288 centenarians so that's within the 100 to 104 year age range 572 semi-super centenarians so that's within the 105 to 109 year old range and then 36 super centenarians so in other words this cohort included people who were at least 85 and as old as older than 110 years all right so then in terms of the data first we've got the hr that's the hazard ratio or all cause mortality risk in other words risk of death for all causes and that's represented numerically on the left and then visually on the right and then in the middle we've got the 95 confidence interval and note that that's the data in parentheses when that date is either completely above one or completely below one we have a significant association with all-cause mortality risk so let's start off by taking a look at hdl ldl and hba1c so first we can see that their confidence intervals completely overlap with one numerically and visually we can see that when putting up a red line at that hazard ratio of 1 that each of their confidence intervals which is represented by the horizontal line inside of each square or to the left and to the right of each square we can see that there too overlaps with one and hence is not significantly associated with all cause mortality risk within the 85 to older than 110 year age range in contrast we can see that albumin's 95 confidence interval is completely below one and that's we can see visually on the right in other words relatively higher albumin is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk conversely we can see that data for creatinine and c-reactive protein they're 95 confidence intervals are completely above one and we can see that numerically on the left and then also visually on the right so in other words relatively higher c-reactive protein and creatinine are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so if the goal is longevity or maximum longevity or getting as close to maximum longevity as possible these data would suggest that albumin relatively high albumin relatively low c-reactive protein and relatively low creatinine may be better markers of longevity than glycemic status and lipoproteins all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with cyfox health which includes apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
