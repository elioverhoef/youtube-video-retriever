# Taurine Extends Lifespan (In Mice): What's My Data? (6-Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that toine deficiency is a driver of aging more specifically serum levels of torine decline during aging in mice in monkeys and in people but these are associations what about causation so in the same study young mice were supplemented with torine on the left we've got data for female mice on the right we've got data for male mice and both male and female mice we can see that torine supplementation extended median lifespan the good news is plasma levels of torine can be tracked and potentially optimized so with that in mind i now have data for six tests for torine so what's my data and then additionally is diet correlated with plasm torine with the goal of resisting an age related decline and keeping it relatively youthful so jumping straight into the data we can see those six tests here and these data are generated with iolo's metabolomics kit which besides torine includes data for 600 metabolites discount link in the video's description so in 2023 over five tests average plasm torine levels were 1113 millar or 113 micromolar now as i mentioned the goal is to avoid the age related decline so after the first test in 2024 which is which was in early february torine levels were .11 millar or 110 micromar so second how does about 110 to 113 micromolar compare with age expected data so for that we pull up our age plot from before and based on chronological age i should have an average toine level plasma toine or serum to toine level of 65 micromolar but as we can see i'm higher than expected based on chronological age with an 113 micromol so that's good news but it can be better as we can see even higher levels of torine are found even going back as far as infants now is it optimal to have pl as levels of torine that are at 200 micromolar i'm not sure but for now the goals are to resist the age related decline and to get it a bit higher than 113 micromolar so should i supplement to resist the age related changes and to try to get plasm toine levels a little bit higher now if you're familiar with the channel i do supplement but that's the last resort as i usually use diet as the first pass strategy to try to improve all the biomarkers so with that in mind can i figure out the intake recipe for my biochemistry to to resist age related changes so for that we're going to take a look at 90 comparisons for touring with foods macro and micronutrients so then what's the approach how am i able to do that and for those who are familiar with the channel you're familiar with the approach so this will be this won't be new but for those who are new to the channel since 2015 i've weighed all of my food with a food scale and then i enter those daily food amounts into chronome met and then into a spreadsheet so each blood test then has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests the average dietary intake for those 50 days corresponds to the latter test so every blood test has a corresponding dietary intake and then with enough test and track dietary data i can calculate correlations and after calculating the correlations with the goal of improving biomarkers i then follow as many of the significant correlations as possible so if there are 10 significant correlations based on a p value less than 0.05 i try to follow all 10 as i don't know which if any may be impacting the biomarker so with that in mind pulling up the top of the 90 comparisons as shown here because i can't fit 90 comparisons onto just one slide it would be too too too big and the font would be too small so on the left we've got the food or nutrient on the right we've got the lowercase n which is the number of tests so six tests and then the p value as i mentioned 0.05 less than that being statistically significant and then the lower case r which is a correlation coefficient and on this list we can see that only two nutrients or foods are currently significant correlated with plasma levels of torine coconut butter and sfa or saturated fatty acid levels now note that these are basically the same item because the majority of my saturated fat fat intake is coming from coconut butter nonetheless these are both positive correlations in other words relatively higher intakes of coconut butter or saturated fatty acids in my diet is significantly correlated with higher plasma levels of torine over those six tests so with that in mind with the goal of keeping torine relatively high i should aim for the higher end of my intake range now note that i i'm waiting on results for the second me metabolomic test in 2024 which i mailed in early march march 4th of 2024 and for the 3 week period prior to that test i had already increased coconut butter and saturated fat intake to an average of 25 gram per day whereas for the previous metabolomic test the average saturated fatty acid intake was 19 gram per day and i did that in conjunction with the ldl the need and pace experiment and if you missed the y for that it'll be in the right corner so then the big question is will eating coconut butter towards the higher end of my range help keep torine levels relatively higher or further increase it for the next test now if it doesn't the correlation for coconut butter and saturated fatty acids will then weaken and note that after every test i recalculate correlations and then follow once again whatever the top correlations are with the goal of improving that biomarker and also all the other biomarkers i don't want to improve one biomarker and then mess up a whole host of other biomarkers so whether it'll work or not results should be in for metabolomics by the end of the month so expect an update video come coming sometime after that all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health which includes ail b and grim age green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die charing brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
