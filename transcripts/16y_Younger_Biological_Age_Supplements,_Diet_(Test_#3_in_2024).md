# 16y Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Test #3 in 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number three in 2024 we saw that my biological age was 16.1 years younger than my chronological and that's when using dr morgan line's biological age calculator pheno so what might be contributing to these data so starting off with prescription meds i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin 137.5 micrograms per day since then all right that brings us to supplements so a staple in the approach for the non-summer months as i live in boston uh for 8 to n9 months out of the year is vitamin d 1,000 i us per day and we can see that i took it for 56 or all 56 days that correspond to this blood test so what is that 56-day period well it starts immediately or started immediately after blood test number two which was on march 4th and lasted until the day before this test which was on april 28th so that 56-day period is the period from test number two to test number three i also supplemented with methyl b12 1,000 microgram per day but only 21 of the 56 days and that's with the goal of potentially lowering homosysteine and from from putting uh higher levels and lower levels of methyl b12 in my approach it seems to have somewhat of a 10% or less impact on homoy which isn't a big bump and i'm looking into other ways to try to reduce it as it heads up on a future video one strategy that i'm trying is increasing branch chain amino acid levels or bcaas and i'll have more on that in an upcoming video all right so i also supplemented with nicotinic acid 50 to 60 milligrams per day for half of the days for the 56 day period 28 days and that's with the goal of increasing nad now i haven't had it in there for every day because i've been playing around with when to include it with the rationale of using it on exercise days as that that's when i may need the nad boo ned boost the most all right and that's it no other purported geer protectors or senol linic which brings us to diet more specifically what diet composition corresponds to blood test number three in 2024 and that's what we'll see here average daily dietary intake and note that i track my diet every day weighing all my food then entering it into a chronometer and then manually entering that data into a spreadsheet so we're going to look at the 56- day average from test number two through test number three the first half of the diet is shown here and this list is ranked in grams uh ranked on the left in grams on the right with the exception of green tea which is in ounces and if you want to use what i use for green te discount link in the video's description all right so were there any experiments for this test the goal is to improve the weak spots while not messing up all the other biomarkers so there were two main experiments for this test the first was uh the ldl ded and pace experiment so in my data relatively higher levels of ldl are significantly correlated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging so to test that i've been trying to slowly bump ldl above my normal range and uh if you missed the rationale the full rationale to that i'll put that video in the in the right corner but that data is not yet in from true diagnostic so i'm hoping to see how that data looks in about a week or two so i added five eggs per week and i raised coconut butter by a few grams per day with the goal of increasing ldl i also added clover sprouts into my diet and that's an average of 73 g per day but as we'll see in a minute it was actually a lot more than that and that's because crimson clover seeds or red clover seeds which is what i used for sprouting have high levels of teline which increases ned in mice so to further test that for 11 days prior to this test i added uh or i doubled clover sprout intake relative to an april test 250 g per day with the goal of increasing nad and whether or not if it worked we see that in wednesday's video all right so on to the second half of the diet as shown there where we can see that i ate 54 different foods for this test now the diet isn't always purposefully clean i do include cheat meals as having no cheat meals can increase the risk of having a binge or overeating and i'm trying to eliminate and minimize that risk uh so two cheap meals keeps me satiated with a little bit of junk while not obsessing about junk or food uh with more cheat meals so the standard for my cheat meal is is chocolate mixed with peanut butter so i make like a homemade reese's peanut butter cup and i also sometimes add extra sweetener to it so for this this test it was sugar another test it's been honey sweet and condensed milk i'm actually probably working on the recipe for how i enjoy it best so in in terms of how many calories the chocolate and sugar contributed in terms of their percentage of the overall calories in the diet uh the chocolate chips for 2 days two days of intake it was about 606 calories the sugar over 2 days was 311 calories and when adding them together dividing them by total calorie intake for the 60 56 day period the junk adds up to 8% of total calories so the diet is 99.1 or two sorry per clean all right so this list is ranked in grams what about ranking foods in terms of calories and that's what we can see here this is the top 10 list and note that this these data are generated by chronometer if you want to track your own diet like i do there's a discount link for chronometer in the video's description so in terms of the top food from where i'm getting my calories from once again as it's been for many tests it's from sardin so i'm not a vegan unlike others in this space not vegan and the reason rationale for that is not is nothing other than my biomarkers are better when i include fish in the diet all right so then in terms of the list the top 10 list nine of this uh the 10 foods that are on this list were also on the list for test number two and the goal goal there is to not blow up the system i'm trying to make small changes to improve the weak spot so i want to keep the overall structure while not messing up the system so in terms of what came out and what what went in i increased peanut intake because it's a rich source of tryptophan ban which declines during aging and i cut down on almonds correspondingly for to match the calories so i'm not increasing calorie intake so almonds left the top 10 list and i didn't increase pistachio intake but they entered the top 10 list for the first time time all right what about macronutrients so starting off with calorie intake average daily calorie intake was 277 and i've said this for many blood tests or many diets that correspond to blood tests but this once again is the closest to lowest or close to lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of uh 2015 so my previous low was almost identical to this for the last test 2076 and and as a quick heads up for the first test in 16 tests where i've sequentially reduced calorie intake for each of those 16 16 tests the next test i've purposely increase calorie intake uh by a small amount uh and that's to test um well quick story uh uh red blood cells in hemoglobin and shbg those are the biomarkers that are involved those are the ones i'm looking to impact with a relatively higher calorie intake small increase for now to see if it moves in the right those three biomarkers move in the right direction that story we'll cover that more for test number four's video in a couple months or maybe in a few weeks average daily protein intake for this test was about 101 gram per day which was 19.4% of total calories in terms of total fat we can see that here uh average daily fat intake was 90 gram per day which is 39.1% of total calories and just to illustrate how this compares test over test we can see test number two's data here average daily fat intake was 8 4 gram per day and that 6 g increase uh was made up mostly from saturated fat coconut butter i increase coconut butter as that's significantly correlated with higher ldl in my data again trying to test that ldl ded and pace correlation but there was also a small increase from monounsaturated fatty acids probably in part because of an increase in peanut intake but as i keep mentioning the goal is to make small changes without blowing up the system and keeping almost everything else constant and we can see that for omega3 and omega 6 as they were 9.5 and 16 g for test number three and also 9.5 and 16 g for test number two all right next up is carbon th and total carbs were 257 g per day but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber fiber intake that corresponded to this test was about 87 gams per day and when subtracting that from total carbs gives a net carbs of a 171 gram per day we can then multiply that 171 by 4 calories per gram to see that net carbs yields 33% of my total diet for this test now note that fiber also contributes calories to the diet and that's because within fiber it's comprised of insoluble and soluble fiber the soluble fiber fraction which is about 20% is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids so in other words a fraction of total fiber is converted into fat so for this that was about 178 calories that was converted or potentially converted from fiber into short chain fatty acids which is 88.5% of total calories so now that we know the breakdowns we can look at net macros and by adding the calories that came from fiber being converted into short chain potentially converted into short chain fatty acids and adding that to the 39.1% we can see that net macros were 47.6% fat 33% net carbs and 9 18.4% protein all right note that within total carbs i also track sugar intake but more specifically total fructose because the diet is rich in fructose containing vegetables and fruits and in my data uh higher total fructose is signif correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i have to try to keep to aim to limit my fructose intake somewhat so uh sucrose is half fructose so when dividing 47.1 / 2 and then adding that to fructose that yields a total fructose of 59 gram per day and i know i say this in every video that may seem like a lot but my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracking in 2015 is 57 and a5 grams per day so 59 is pretty close to that now i've since been able to reduce fructose intake a bit further so uh test number four may be the first test since 2015 where i've been able to go a bit below my lowest 57.5 gam per day and we'll see if impacts biomarkers or not i may not have been able to cut fructose by enough to make a a dent on uh potential weak spots or if it impacts anything we'll find out all right what about micronutrients that correspond to test number three so starting with vitamins as shown full list it may be hard to see so i'd encourage going full screen if you can't see it note that there is full rda coverage and for anyone starting on this journey that's what i generally recommend not trying to mega do anything but just going for uh meeting the rda for all vitamins and minerals that's the baseline for a few tests now many of these vitamins though are purposefully much higher than the rda as i'm following correlations their correlations with a panel of about 25 biomarkers and if you're interested in those correlations i post them on patreon so check it out just to highlight one of those real quick you can see vitamin k at about 25 uh 2550 micrograms per day what's been defined as an adequate intake is only 100 microgram per day so that's 25x the rda and that's only because i'm following its correlation it has a net positive correlative score with that panel of about 25 biomarkers that represent many different organ systems now just to highlight too the consistency in the approach we can see vitamin intake for test number two and for the most part almost everything is i or in the same ballp park as the same with very small exceptions uh you can see that choline intake is a bit higher and that's because added eggs which are a rich source of choline all right next up is mineral intake as we can see there and just to compare against test number two here too we can see that it's almost completely identical test over test so again i know i probably sound like a broken record at this point but the goal is to make small targeted experiments without blowing up the overall system and from vitamins and minerals we can see that that's mostly the case there is one exception though with a heads up now for test number four experiments for test number four i've since increased lenum intake to what's been defined as a tolerable upper limit 400 microgram per day and note that this is all from whole food almost exclusively coming from brazil nuts and mushrooms which are my main sources of selenium and that's because selenium is required for conversion of free t4 the thyroid hormone t4 into free t3 and i'll have more on that story a week from today that's the plan to get out a thyroid focus video a week from today all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging incl uh check us out on patreon where i post data for daily diet so rather than looking at 56 day averages uh once every couple of months for blood test i post daily diet on patreon we've also got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing or microbiome composition any quantification atome metabolomics at home blood testing with sci fox health which includes a different panel from the metabolomics including apob b and grimage green tea as mentioned earlier diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
