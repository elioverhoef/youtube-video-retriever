# Biological Age Testing: 15 Years Younger Than My Chronological Age

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The biological age calculator that i'm going to talk about today is levine's phenotypic age and what that comprises are nine clinical clinical variables and that's shown here including abdomen creatinine serum glucose inflammation c-reactive protein the percentage of lymphocytes of total white blood cells the average red cell volume red cell distribution with alkaline phosphatase white blood cell count and age as the tenth variable so the importance of this biological age calculator is illustrated by the finding that it's highly correlated with chronological age so these ten variables be it's correlation with chronological age is 0.94 so a chronic a correlation of one or negative one is ideal optimal as good as it gets so a 0.94 is pretty close to one so it's a very strong correlation between these biomarkers with being able to predict biological age or yeah so that that data was derived from the national health and nutrition study a big dataset relatively big data set of about 10,000 people so they replicated that these findings the pheno a phenotypic age calculator as a measure of biological aging by looking at a separate dataset in haines for and this data set included 11,000 people and you can see visually that phenotypic age was eat a little bit even more strongly correlated with chronological age with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 now just to put this in perspective the epigenetic clock horvath initial epigenetic lock the correlation between that chronological age was 0.97 so 0.94 to 0.96 is pretty close to that if not you know identical somewhat identical so all right so why is it important besides this ability to predict by a biological age so the combination of those 10 variables are also associated with risk of death from all causes also known as all cause mortality risk so for every one year increase in - big gage for your biological age all cause mortality risk increases by 9% you can see that here by looking at all cause mortality for the full sample 9% increased significant significant 9% increase for each one year increase in biological age now this finding was also true whether it was looking at young adults middle-aged adults our old older adults so there was a higher risk of all-cause mortality with a one-year increase in phenotypic age now in terms of disease specific deaths almost all of them on the list here heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease diabetes influenza or pneumonia which may have some relevance - kovach related conditions but that's pure speculation and then the friday's so for again for every one year increase in phenotypic age each of these outcomes the risk for each of these of death from each of these outcomes increases with the one exception for cerebral vascular disease phenotypic age was not associated that in in haines for so optimizing biological age how do you do it so you just go to your doctor get your the standard chemistry panel which is commonly performed that the yearly physical plus the cbc the standard blood chemistry count which includes white blood cells red blood cells hemoglobin and their differentials and then it also you would have to ask for c-reactive protein so the combination of those two seventy-five to eighty dollars at least in the us it may be different in other countries in just a third for comparison well yeah so it's relatively cheap compared to other measures of biological age including the epigenetic clock so i have somebody crunched the numbers in and so that i embedded that link on this link here so if you want to calculate your phenotypic age if you have all these blood test data you can actually calculate your own biological age using the phenotypic age calculator and knowing your biological age is interesting but optimizing it is better so how do you do that so how does each analyte change during aging what's this association with risk of death from all causes and then what's my data i'm gonna show some of my data where applicable can diet fitness for optimization of body composition impacted and for the last part of this i just want to mention that i could have i could have used you know large epidemiological studies to say hey in this study of 10,000 people this has been shown to reduce albumin but and i actually started with that approach when i first started tracking and i noticed that a lot of what's published in the epidemiological study weren't affecting my biomarkers and it wasn't until i started more rigorous blood testing and dietary tracking that i was able to find the diet pattern that best influences my biomarkers as opposed to what's been published in large cohorts so let's see what the so let's start with what's my biological age so this is my last blood test measurement two months ago in march and after putting in all of my data i come up with a phenotypic age in 31 years 30 1.61 years i should mention i i think i have 8 or 9 measurements that include all of these blood test variables over the last two years when i first started measuring my phenotypic gauge was higher it was actually 35 something and i have articles on my website if for anyone wants to read about that so in theory you could say i've reduced my biological age over the past year or so and that's mostly by changing my diet improving my fitness in body composition which wasn't bad to start with but nonetheless it is indeed possible to improve this in the short short term so the b the importance of this number the 31 around you know 31 and 32 years old it's important because my chronological age is actually 47 some at least 15 years younger than my chronological age so as i mentioned one way that i'm reducing my biological age is through diet so every day with a food scale i weigh all my food and then i track that data using free freely available online software so i track everything including macro and micro nutrients so protein carbs fat and then vitamins minerals whatever the food tracking software can track i log it into an excel file and then over the past year or so i started tracking actual food intake so how much of each food that i'm consuming because to just break down food into macro and micronutrients i may be missing a whole bunch of phytochemicals that that may be optimizing certain biomarkers so by looking at individual foods it kind of accounts for that so i've been blood testing about four to six times per year and because i'm tracking my diet i can then take the average dietary intake during that period that corresponds to the blood test and that's one data point so with enough data points i can have enough statistical power to identify potentially meaningful correlations between stuff in my diet and my blood tests now if you only measure once a year or less stop blast off less often it's going to be harder to do that because you just won't know it's too imprecise so well that's what i do and then once identify correlations between diet with my blood test results i make dietary changes i'm constantly changing stuff in my diet to tweak my diet to see how it effects and to try to push my biomarkers in the right direction
