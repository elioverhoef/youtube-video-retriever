## Transcript

Ned declines during aging and that's important because it impacts hallmarks of aging including cell inessence mitochondrial dysfunction dna damage and many others but what about tiir shortening so i now have data for 11 tests and we can ask the question are blood intracellular levels of nad significantly correlated with teir length and taking it a step further is n significantly correlated with measures of biological age and those measures include dutting and pace which is potentially the best epigenetic clock for measuring or evaluating the epigenetic pace of aging horvath which is the best epigenetic clock for asking the question how old are you and then pheno age which if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me make many videos about it's a standard clinical chemistry based biomarker biological age calculator that includes things like albumin creatinine glucose uh hscrp and others and then taking it a step further i also have data for about 25 other biomarkers so is any significantly correlated with any of those biomarkers so let's start off by taking a look at t length versus nad which is what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got dna m t length so that's the dna methylation this is an epigenetic estimation of t length and to generate that data i sent it to true diagnostic and as a quick side note uh epig the epigenetic estimation of ti length may be a better measure than standard the standard ways to measure tm length at least in terms of all cause mortality and if anyone is interested in seeing that paper a post it in the video's comments all right and then on the x-axis we've got nad blood intracellular levels of nad and to generate that data i sent it to g infinity so if you want to measure your own tmr length or nad levels there are discount links in the video's description so in terms of the correlation we can see that it's not significant t length is not significantly correlated with nad as you can see that p value as highlighted in red is not close to below less than 0.05 with a p value of 0.75 all right what about d and pace and as i mentioned it's potentially the best epigenetic clock for addressing the epigenetic speed or pace of aging and if you missed that video i'll put it in the right corner but more recently it's been popularized because of the rejuvenation olympics which is basically a competition to see who has the slowest epigenetic pace of aging as the the rejuvenation olympics includes or uses the kn and pace with the data shown here for the kn and pace versus nad and here too we can see that the correlation is not significant for donan paast versus nad as the p value is 0.36 you know if we even took it a step further the the trend lines for both tm length is downward right so inverse which suggests that higher ned is correlated with a shorter t length but again note that it's not a significant correlation so we can't say that but nonetheless that trend line is going in the wrong direction similarly for don and pce that trend line would be going going in the wrong direction too as higher ned is correlated with a higher denum pace but again the p value is not significant so we can't conclude that we can conclude that ned is not significantly correlated with the need and pace nonetheless trend lines are not going in the right direction all right what about the correlation for ned with horvath's epigenetic age and that's what we can see here and now that trend line is going in the right direction as you can see higher levels of nad would be correlated with a younger horvath's epigenetic age but in terms of the stats they're not significantly correlated you can see the p value is 0.24 which is greater than 0.05 the threshold for statistical significance so ned is not significantly correlated with horvath's epigenetic age so from these three epigenetic measures tm length denan pace and horvath we can see that at least through 11 tests ned is not significantly correlated with any of these measures but as a weakness or a limitation in this story note that i only have one data point for any l blood intracellular levels of nad in the 30 to 60 micromolar range most of my data is less than 30 micromolar and i've got two data points that are greater than 60 micromolar so the plan for ned for tests going forward is to slowly increase my nicotinic acid supplementation so that i can generate more ned data you know 30 32 34 so that we can really see what what does the data look like with a spread from 20 micromolar to 60 plus micromolar rather than having just three data points higher than about 30 micromolar all right so what about pheno is ned significantly correlated with pheno and that's what we can see here and just visually right from the jump we can see that the trend line is going in the right direction so higher ned will be correlated with a younger fenal age but in terms of the stats they are not significantly correlated as that p value is 0.6 far higher than 0.05 the threshold for significance but in this case it looks like we've got an outlier so uh greater than 60 micromolar for nad that's the only spot actually higher than 40 micromolar it's just out there all by itself potential outlier so if i remove that data and rerun the stats 10 test analysis the correlation improves you can see it goes from negative .18 to more negative nega .39 and that p value gets closer to 0.05 0.26 but still nonetheless over 10 or 11 tests whether or not we take out that outlier ned is not significantly correlated with pheno so we can see from uh evaluating t length and three other measures of biological age at least through 11 tests ned is not significant correlated with any of these measures so what about ned being correlated with other biomarkers so for those who don't know i don't go to my physician and basically beg them to run tests every couple of months which would be a nightmare i mean from my pre previous experience in trying to get that done in the early days uh in 2015 of using this approach i basically had to beg my physician to blood test all the things that i wanted a blood test for fortunately if you live in the states uh you can use ulta labs uh and ala labs is basically where you go to their website you pick the blood test that you want to measure you bring them to quest if you're in the united states and then for a $10 blood draw fee or something in that ballpark you they draw they generate your data and i got results for almost all of my data for the uh blood test number five in 2024 within 24 hours which is pretty fantastic so if you're if you're a regular blood tester like me and you want to help help support the channel there's an affiliate link for ulta labs in the video's description all right so is ned associated or significantly correlated with any of the standard uh chemistry panel 25 biomarkers so there were indeed significant inverse correlations for the sum of a plus alt these are mostly liver specific enzymes and i find it more informative to comp combine both a and alt as they're basically cinear at least for me in my case they either increase the together or decrease together so i find that measuring this their sum is more informative than looking at either of them individually so higher nad is significantly correlated with a lower a and alt and that's potentially good news because values uh relatively high values you know getting towards 40 and above is associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality a higher nad is also significant significantly correlated with lower ldl which in terms of heart disease mortality risk could be good news and if you want to see the act ual r values and p values for all of these correlations for the 25 correlations that's on the correlations tier on patreon with a whole bunch of other correlations so check it out if you're interested all right there were also some significant positive correlations so higher n was significantly correlated with higher levels of platelets and notice that i've got the ones going in the right direction coded as green so the platelet correlation with nb could be a potentially good thing as platelets decline during aging so if ned is causitive and we don't know if it's positive it's just a correlation if it's positive in higher platelets that would potentially resist an age related decline and then we can see also that ned is significantly uh uh correlated or positively correlated with systolic blood pressure sbp and that's going in the wrong direction because systolic blood pressure increases during aging so that's an interesting or at least an interesting correlation for me because if you if you saw the the paper that was published earlier this year for nasin metabolites causing vascular inflammation or nin degradation metabolites causing vascular inflammation it raises the interesting question of is higher ned and to get there i have to supplement with nicotinic acid which is nasin or one of the two forms of nasin is higher nad in in response to higher nasin supplementation is that leading to some amount of vascular inflammation and then negatively impacting or increasing systolic blood pressure i don't know the answer to that we'll see how this story plays out with more more data more nad data more uh tracking of blood pressure so stay tuned for that in a future video video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you may be interested in that you can help support the channel while blood testing on your own including ulta labs epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apb and also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or you can support the channel with buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description
