# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #1 in 2022 (Test #35 Since 2015)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Earlier this week got blood tested for the first time in 2022 and note that this is my 35th blood test since 2015. So with that in mind what's my biological age so when entering data for the nine biomarkers on morgan levine's phenotypic gauge calculator which is a metric that's used to calculate biological age we can see that my phenotypic age or my biological age is 32.6 years which is 16.4 years younger than my chronological so a couple of quick notes uh quests high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be 0.3 as i've entered here but it also could be some value less than 0.3 as that's below the detection limit for their assay also note that all blood test data from the lab is provided at the end of the video so if you're interested in seeing that check it out and also if you have your own blood test data you can calculate your own biological age using phenoage with a link that's provided in the video's description all right so one blood test is interesting but for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2020 which is what's shown here with morgan levine's phenotypic age or biological age on the y-axis plotted against time so in 2020 i measured six times and my average biological age over those six measurements was 35.6 years similarly i tested six times in 2021 and again my average uh pheno age or biological age was 35.6 years so we can see that for the recent test 32.6 this is my best value over these 12 measurements over the past two years and i also have three measurements from 2018 to 2019. This data 32.6 is also better than those three measurements so this is my lowest biological age result using phenoage over 16 tests since 2018. Now there's an interesting trend or potential trend going on in this data and note that my first measurement in 2021 was also very good and my lowest value for the year but note that this was taken in early march so march 1st of 2021 so this raises the issue of whether my best data may be a seasonal trend with the best data in the beginning of the year relative to the other parts of the year so to assess that let's look at 2020 data and interestingly uh the same trend is apparent so my best or lowest biological age values were for the first two tests in 2020 34.6 years and 33.5 and these were tests that were taken in february and march of 2020. So whether this plays out uh for 2022 and beyond uh we'll see all right so is there room for improvement how can i improve the the data for these nine biomarkers so prior to this test over the 15 tests prior to this test my average phenoage reduction relative to my chronological age was close to 12 years so 11.9 years younger than my chronological age as an average for each test over that 15 test period now 16.4 years is i think as close as as close to as good as it gets for me maybe others can reach a lower level but i think this is pretty close to as good as it gets for me i may be able to reduce glucose by a small amount and creatinine by a small amount but the tweaking involved you know to optimize those further uh may make other stuff worse so for me consistently maintaining this data test the test and having less variability so i don't see things like 39.8 in 2020 or 37.1 in 2021 being able to consistently maintain this data test the test is my main priority going forward now note that phenoage includes chronological age in its model which limits the maximal bio maximum biological age reduction in contrast aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so what's my aging.ai biological age so aging.ai has 19 components or aging.ai 3.0 has 19 components and when entering the data for those 19 biomarkers as shown here i get a biological age of 26 years which is 23 years younger than my chronological so again one blood test is interesting but let's have a look at more context with previous data for aging.ai age and that's what's shown here so aging.aih on the y-axis plotted against time starting from 2009. So i have 31 blood tests now for uh that can be used to calculate aging.ai uh biological age and starting in 2009 i was testing a little less than once per year and we can see that from 2009 to 2013 with over three blood tests over a five year period my average aging.ai age was 32 years and then i blood tested 27 times from 2016 to 2021 uh yielding an average aging.ai biological age of 29.9 years so we can see that this recent 26 is uh tied for the best that i've had over this 31 blood test period since 2009 and the only the only other time that i reached 26 for aging.ai age was set six years ago in uh 2016. So this raises the issue is this biological age reduction 16.4 years for pheno age and 23 years for aging.ai is this a random event or can i maintain it so stay tuned for that data in future videos as i'm going to blood test probably seven or eight times this year now another issue that arises is what's contributing to this biological age reduction what's my diet fitness and or supplements so in upcoming videos i'll address that and then is there is there a weakness in my data and one potential weakness may be values for total cholesterol hdl and ldl so when compared with the all-cause mortality data each of these 100 values of 130 for total cholesterol 41 for hcl and 75 for ldl would be associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so in an upcoming video i'll address how i intend to address whether this may be good or bad for overall health so stay tuned for that all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
