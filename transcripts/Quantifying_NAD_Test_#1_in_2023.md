## Transcript

Nad declines during aging and that's what we can see here with activity or levels of nad plotted on the y-axis against age on the x so in youth nad levels are relatively high whereas at in advanced age they're relatively low and that's important because nad impacts the health and or function of many organ systems as shown here so starting with nad at the middle we can see that nad impacts the health and or function of the brain and nervous system liver vasculature heart and so on down the list so with these data in mind what's my intracellular level of nad so to measure that i use the ginfinity intracellular nad assay and if you're interested in measuring your own levels of nad there'll be a discount link in the video's description now on to the question of the day which is what's my intracellular level of nad and that's what we can see here so my concentration of nad intracellular this is for all blood cells is 25.6 micromolar so what does that mean is that high low is it good bad etc so for that we go to ginfinity's definition of categories where deficient is defined as 20 to 30 micromolar whereas optimal would be higher 40 to 100 micromolar so why are these data considered optimal or deficient more specifically why would 42 100 micromolar be considered optimal so for that we go back to our initial question of how do intracellular levels of nad change during aging but now let's have a look at more specific data using ginfinity's data and that's what we can see here so nad again declines during aging but this is with more specific data including actual micromolar amounts and engine infinities data this is a data for 116 subjects so starting with people that are younger than 20 years old the average intracellular level of nad is 44 micromolar which then is significantly higher than 20 to 30 year olds who had an average nad level of 34 micromolar 20 to 30 year olds also have a significantly higher level of nad when compared with 30 to 55 year olds with an average nad level of 29 micromolar and then 55 to 90 year olds who had an average nad level of 27 micro molar that wasn't significant different from the 30 to 55 year olds that's shown by the p-value being greater than 0.05 now to put my data into perspective for my chronological age currently of 50 years and my nad level of 25.6 micromolar that would put me in the age category in terms of intracellular levels of nad so this is one way to look at the data another is by comparing data for subjects that were younger than 30 and for this group they had the average nad level was 42 micromolar with people who are older than 30 who had an average nad level of 28 micromolar and when using a two sample t-test these data are indeed significantly different so we can see that people younger than 30 have about a 30 33 percent higher level of intracellular nad or compare when compared with people older than 30 years now what about the optimal range that was 4200 micromolar if we look at ginfinity's data for people younger than 20 the interquartile range that a blue box that would suggest that 40 to 50 micromolar may be optimal now that i have aged nad levels is a bit of of a surprise and that's because relatively high niacin and epigenic intake should have positively impacted nad so let's take a look at that story so for that we'll have to look at pathways that impact the concentration of nad which is shown here with nad at the bottom and at the top we've got n a n n a m n a is nicotinic acid which is converted by three enzymatic steps into nad similarly nam is niacinamide and that's converted first into nmn popular dietary supplement and then nmn is converted into nad so two enzymatic steps from niacinamide to nad now both of these nicotinic acid and niacinamide are found in the dietary vitamin vitamin b3 niacin which then raises the question am i niacin deficient so as we all know on this channel i track my diet every day i weigh all my food i've done that since 2015 and since january of 2022 my average daily niacin intake is 41 milligrams per day so what does that mean let's put that into perspective well compared with the rda which is 16 milligrams of niacin per day i'm currently at two two and a half fold higher than the rda4 niacin had taken it's been like that for at least the past 13 months so to address the question am i niacin deficient the answer would be no so this this is one reason why i'm surprised that my nad levels are relatively low or aged now alternatively nad can be degraded into nam and that's in part by the action of the enzyme cd38 now fortunately cd38 can be be inhibited by food components including epigenin and that's what we can see here with cd38 activity on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of epigenin on the x and at about 50 micromolar of epigenin we can see that cd38 activity is about 85 percent inhibited in the presence of epigenin now we may not need that much epigenet to inhibits cd38 activity because in data from that same paper and note that this paper and all the other papers in the video be in the video's description in this same paper 25 micromolar epigenin was sufficient to increase intracellular levels of nad which is shown here with nad levels plotted on the y-axis and then we can see that in cells from mice that were treated with 25 micromolar epigenin there was about a 75 increase for nad levels above control so with that in mind that raises the question then am i epigen and deficient thereby leading to higher than uh usual or expected cd38 levels leading to an increased degradation of nad and relatively aged levels of nad in my situation so my primary source of epigenid comes from fresh parsley fresh parsley has about 215 milligrams of epigenin per 100 grams and this is from the usda flavonoid database i'll put that link also in the video's description now since i track my dietary intake every day i know my average parsley intake since uh and over the past about year and a half i've averaged 49 grams per day of parsley so when multiplying these two data the concentration or content of epigenin in parsley and my average parsley intake we get an average epigenin daily intake of 106 milligrams per day now when considering the molecular weight of epigenin and total blood volume i can then count and assuming 100 absorption which may probably isn't the case but assuming 100 absorption i would get a circulating blood concentration of 79 micromolar for epigenin based just on my parsley intake now remember though we may not need a 79 micromolar to inhibit or fully close to fully inhibited cd38 even if there's only 30 absorption of epigenin or absorption from abigenin in the blood into cells even if it's only a third of that i would still get close to the 25 micro molar needed to almost completely inhibit cd38 so to address the question am i apogenic deficient based on this data probably not so this data for nad my relatively low nad is also surprising because my biological age data is relatively useful and that's in the presence of this 25.6 micro molar nad and note that the nad measurement was done on the same day around the same time that i sent my blood for analysis and when entering the biomarkers for levine's pheno age as shown here i was 17 years younger on that day and when using aging.ai 22 years younger so i've got relatively youthful biological age data but yet relatively low nad which then raises the question which biomarkers may be improved by increasing nad and i covered this at the end of my last video so if you missed it this uh this will be new but if you saw my last video this won't be new so cholesterol conversion into dhea dhea is the precursor metabolite for dhea sulfate which declines during aging and relatively low levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk dhea sulfate is low and potentially a weakness in my data so the conversion of cholesterol into dhea requires nadph so starting from cholesterol and ending with dhea there it's five enzymatic steps and each of them require nadph now nadph stands for nicotinamide adenine dinuclei dinucleotide which is nad only with a phosphate group so nad phosphate is essentially nadph which then raises the question is relatively low nad limiting dhea and then because dhea will be limiting i would have relatively low levels of dhea sulfate so to test that step one is will 300 milligrams per day which i've been doing for about the past two weeks of nmn and yes i did start supplementing with nmn for those who think i'm anti-supplements i'm not i just i favor targeted supplementation with a demonstrated need in this case there may be a demonstrated need so will 300 milligrams per day of nmn increase nad step two is i'm going to send my blood for nad analysis and i plan on doing that about a week from now and we'll see if that amount of nmn is sufficient to raise nad levels if not in step three i plan on increasing my nmn intake to around 600 milligrams per day maybe even higher but let's see how the test results go first and then in step four i'm going to do a full blood panel again in march march 6th that's the targeted date for blood test number two in 2023 and in that test i'll measure not just my intracellular level of nad but all of the measurements for levine sphenowage aging.ai and all the three epigenetic tests that i commonly get and then we'll see if nmn can impact not just nad but hopefully not change any of the other biomarkers with the exception of dhs or even any of the other weaknesses that i have in my data including things like homocysteine or horvaths epigenetic clock all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts
