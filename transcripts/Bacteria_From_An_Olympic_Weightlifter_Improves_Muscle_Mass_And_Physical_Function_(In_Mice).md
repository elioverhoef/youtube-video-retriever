Can gut bacteria from an olympic athlete improve muscle mass and physical function so first who's the olympic athlete that sing chun quo now's aboriginal name is tana so for the rest of this video i refer to her as tana is a highly accomplished weight lifter and we can see that by taking a look at her metal record which is shown here now most recently she earned a gold medal in the 2020 tokyo olympic games but you can see she's also won a lot of gold medals and some silver and bronze at a variety of other weightlifting competitions since 2010. So what was the experimental approach with the goal of addressing the question can gut bacteria from olympic athlete improve muscle mass and physical function so starting from her poop a specific bacterium was isolated and that's lactate planty bacillus plantarum which was then transplanted once per day for four weeks into young which were six week old male mice and the mice were icr mice as shown there on the left and then did this specific bacterium isolated from tana the elliptic weightlifter the olympic a weight lifter did el planetarium improve muscle mass and physical function so what was the impact of el planetarium colonization on muscle mass let's start there so here we can see a variety of characteristics on the left including relative tissue weights for a variety of tissues now the relative weight equals the tissue weight divided by 100 multiplied by by a hundred percent and for each of the tissues that were examined we can see that it's liver muscle kidney heart lung a couple of fat depots including including the epidimal fat pad efp and then also brown adipose tissue bat and then also the cecum now there are four groups first on the left we've got vehicles so mice that were not supplemented with bacteria from tana and then we've got three different tenor groups tana 1x 2x and 5x which were increasing concentrations of bacteria that were supplemented to the mice and if you're interested in the exact concentrations that were used we can see that there so what was different between groups so for that we go to the trend analysis and we can see that there were three that were significantly different between the groups first was muscle mass so starting with the vehicle which had a relative muscle weight of 0.95 we can see that all of the 10 are groups 10 and 1x 2x and 5x had significantly increased a significantly increased relative muscle weight when compared with vehicles so 0.99.99 and 1.04 percent when compared with vehicle but also fat masters was reduced the efp the epididymal fat pad was reduced so first starting with vehicle which had a e f p of 0.9 percent we can see that tan of 5x had a significantly reduced efp percentage of 0.74 but last but not least we can see that the second weight was affected or uh so 2.66 in the vehicle and before going on note that the cecum is a major site of bacterial short chain fatty acid scfa production and i've covered short chain fatty acids in a variety of videos on this channel so if you're interested in that just do a search and check it out uh so in the 10 of 5x we can see that the second weight relative secant weight was significantly increased when compared with vehicle which suggests that supplementation of this bacterium from the olympic weightlifter may have altered uh well increased sequim weight which may have altered overall the the overall gut microbiome so i'll have more on that in a minute so collectively from this data from these data we can see that supplementation of l plantarum significantly increased muscle and sql mass while decreasing fat mass so then the next question that could be asked is as a potential explanation for these alterations was body weight or food intake between the groups and we can see that data here so we've got on the left initial body weight final body weight water intake and then dietary intake in terms of grams of food consumed per mouse per day and what we can see is that none of these were significantly different when looking at vehicle versus any of the three tan of supplementation groups so to address the question was body weight or food intake different between the groups it was not all right so what's the impact of el planetarium on physical function so first starting with the relative grip strength as shown there and the that relative grip strength means grip strength divided by body weight times 100 and then we've got our four groups so first looking at vehicle and then the three different tana 1x2x and 5x groups we can see that grip strength would significantly increase for all of the tana groups in other words the mice that were treated with bacterium from the olympic weightlifter had significantly increased grip strength at all concentrations of the bacterium now note that there's a plateau effect at tana 2x and 5x so they're not significantly different from each other in terms of grip strength but both of those 10 and 2x and 5x were higher than both 10 and 1x and the vehicle all right what about aerobic exercise capacity so here we're looking at time to exhaustion and this is a swimming test and once again we've got our four groups and then we can see significa significantly increased time to exhaustion so an improved aerobic exercise capacity in the tana uh the tana supplemented groups were compared with vehicle also note that plateau effect in the tana 2x and 5x again so the highest time to exhaustion was in 10 of 2x and 5x which was significantly higher or significantly longer than 10 to 1x and vehicle so from these two uh from these two images we can see that muscle strength and aerobic exercise capacity were improved in l plantarum supplemented mice so earlier we saw that in there was an increased zika mass in l plantarum supplemented mice so was the gut microbiome altered so for that we go to a beta diversity plot which is a measure of how similar or dissimilar that the gut bacterial communities may be and then we've got our four groups as delineated there with the different colors so starting with the vehicle we can see that that projects to a different space where compared with tana 1x as shown there but then also note that the two highest tana groups as shown in pink and green are in a different space when compared with tana 1x and with the vehicle which suggests an overall different microbiome composition not just for 10 or 1x versus the vehicle but also for the two highest tana groups versus tana 1x and the group that wasn't supplemented with l plantarum so from this we can see that overall gut bacterial composition in l plantarum colonized mice is different from the untreated controls but what that doesn't tell us is which specific bacteria were different so for that we go to a relative abundance plot as shown there and in terms of relative abundance here we're looking at the phylum taxonomic level now you can see that most of the relative abundance is comprised of two main bacterial phyla which are firmicutes and bacteroides so firmicutes in pink or red and bacteries in in blue so when compared with the vehicle you can see that comprises almost all of the bacterial composition just those two bacterial phyla but then for the two highest tana groups 10 to 2x and 10 and 5x we can see that there is a significant decrease for firmicutes in red slash pink but a significant significant increase for bacteroid bacteroides as shown in blue so collectively we can see that lactic planty bacillus plantarum which was isolated from the olympic weight lifter and then supplemented once per day for four weeks into young mice positively impacts the gut muscle axis or more specifically it altered the weight of the cecum it altered the composition of the gut microbiome and then it improved muscle mass but also reduced fat mass so a net positive all right so there's a lot more to this story including what are the effects of el planetarium on the gut muscle axis in aged mice so data in young mice is interesting but what about old mice and also going beyond animal models what's the effects of this bacterium on the gut muscle axis in young and older adult people and more specifically in randomized controlled trials that gave this specific bacterium and the potential impact on both the gut microbiome and on muscle mass so stay tuned for that and if you're interested in seeing that data i'll post it over the next few days on patreon before i make next week next week's video so before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in and these will be in the video's description including epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all of these links will be in the video's description and note that we also have merch so if you're interested in that check it out that too the link for that will be in the videos videos description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
