# Body Composition Assessment (DEXA), 12/2022

## Transcript

About two weeks ago i had my body composition assessed with dexa now dexa stands for dual energy x-ray absorption which basically means that x-rays are used to determine the amounts of lean bone and fat mass so with that in mind what's my data so dexa breaks it down by a region the amount of fat lean and bone mineral content in the left and right arms in the trunk left and right leg the subtotal of all that and then in the head and then the overall total for all of those regions and then going across the columns from left to right we see we've got fat mass lean plus bone mineral content bmc and then the total of fat mass lean and bone mineral content as shown there so i have about 70 kilograms of total fat lean and bone marrow content and what i want to point out real quick is the disparity between the listed weight at the top 68 kilograms and the 71 kilograms at the bottle bottom under the total now the 68 kilograms was my fasting weight first thing in the morning without clothes on so that's the most close to being accurate whereas the total that was given by dexa includes the you know a probably undigested food and i was also fully clothed so that's the 3kg disparity that we can see there and then last but not least we've got the percent fat in the right column so then breaking it down i have about 9.2 kilograms of total fat which when divided by the total amount of fat lean and bone mineral content altogether yields a body fat percentage of 12.9 percent now we can also break down lean plus bone mineral content so i have about 62.8 kilograms of that and then on page two of this document was the bone mineral content again bmc and dexa also breaks it down by region so left and right arm the ribs the spine pelvis left and right leg and then the total in terms of bone runner content for all of those regions and also the head so when taking the sum of all those regions for bmc i have about 2.5 kilograms of bone mineral content and then we can calculate lean mass by subtracting 61.8 minus 2.47 kilograms which yields a lean mass a total whole body lean mass of about 59 kilograms or 131 pounds now this is far from all being muscle mass and that's because lean mass is measured by dexa equals muscle mass but also organ weights and most of that is water aside from the organ weights now going forward the goal at least in terms of aging is can i maintain or improve lean plus bone mineral content as both of those decline during aging while reducing fat mass which increases during aging so my plan is to measure again sometime in the next year maybe a little bit longer up to about 18 months and we'll see how i've improved or not in the next video if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in that that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
