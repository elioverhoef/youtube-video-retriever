# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #1 in 2021

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

On tuesday i got my blood tested for the first time in 2021. So what's my data what's my biological age so that's we can see here the nine variables in chronological age of levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a measure of biological age and based on these data we can see that my phenotypic age again also known as biological age is 32.6 years which is 15.4 years younger than my chronological age of 48. Also note that this is my lowest biological age over 10 measurements since 2018 so i'm on the right track so let's compare these data against a few blood tests so first my previous blood test how did these data compare with my last blood test so my last blood test was in december of 2020 so just two months ago and based on those data my biological age was 33.8 years so i've improved in the two-month period since then so also uh interesting to note are well i should also mention what was the major change so what we can what i've boxed is uh i was able to reduce my c-reactive protein which is a measure of inflammation by about 40 and i'll get more into that in the upcoming slides slides about what i think is driving those uh that reduction um so how did these data compare year over year so i also measured in march of 2020 and there may be seasonal effects uh uh to some of these data so uh how did the data compare year over year so that data is here this is uh the second blood test that i did in 2020 uh and from in march and we're going to compare it against the uh blood test that i just did earlier uh on tuesday and we can see that my phenotypic age is 33.4 years and even though my chronological age went up by one year my biological age was uh reduced by a point eight years so in the right on in the right direction and on the right track also note that my c-reactive protein in that measurement was 0.37 milligrams per liter whereas i i was able to reduce it by about 30 percent for this just recent blood test so the uh obvious question should be or i think is what's my approach how am i doing this how am i able to maintain i maintain this youthful biological age so what's my fitness what's supplements am i taking and what's my diet composition so first in terms of average fitness stats and for those who are interested in uh i posted a picture on my youtube community page uh shirtless shirtless picture where uh you can see that i'm relatively lean i'm working on getting leaner uh i've got you know i've gotten a little bit i've added about five pounds of fat over the past six months or so so i'm working towards getting back to that so uh stay tuned but uh what about other fitness related stats so and these are my average stats uh so this is for example starting with body weight i weigh myself every day in the morning and um so with all of those data what's my average uh body weight during the 62 day period that went from my last blood test to this blood test so uh my average uh body weight was 157.6 pounds and i'm 5 foot 7 which gives me a bmi of 24 points 24.7 kilograms per meter which is at the upper end of the uh lean category and then my resting heart rate rhr is 49 beats per minute my heart rate variability hrv is about 49 milliseconds now for those who've seen my resting heart rate heart rate variability uh video my heart rate variability is actually about 10 milliseconds lower than it then it's been at its peak on average um so uh one reason for that is because of the weight gain that i put on some of the muscles some of the fat over the past six months or so um you know being calorie restricted is not easy for me so i don't oh i'm not always successful i go through periodic swings with a little bit up in weight and then a little bit down away so what supplements am i taking uh so all i take uh is here and uh i take levothyroxine um for hypothyroidism i've taken that for the past 25 years or so since i was diagnosed with it vitamin d in the winter uh a thousand i use a day and only in the winter not in the summer when i get sunlight regularly daily and then i take a stack of methyl folate methyl b12 and b6 to try to keep my homocysteine which likes to get into the 15 range which is about two times as high as it should be and taking this methyl folate methyl b12 and b6 supplement seems to help reduce that down to less than 10. So what about my average daily dietary intake now for those who are familiar with my videos i weigh all of my food i then enter that data into an online nutrition app which i'm not going to say their name not sponsored so i'm not going to you know give give free shout outs but if anybody's interested i'll leave a comment and i'll indicate which one that i use um and then from there i take all of that data and put it in excel files in terms of macros and micros and food quantities so that i can track each of those variables against my blood test data and look for correlations between my diet and the blood test and then try to optimize the blood test variables based on changing things in my diet so the average daily dietary intake is what's shown here and for the two-month period that went from my last blood test until this blood test my average calorie intake was 26 15. Uh protein intake was 123 grams per day which is 19 of my total calorie intake fat intake was 95 grams per day which corresponds to 32 percent of my total calorie intake carbs were 335 grams but which results in 51 of my total calories were from carbohydrates now that may seem like a lot but then uh i i i eat uh about a hundred grand well 100.5 grams of fiber per day and when that uh when considering that that's uh counted as carbohydrate we can subtract the fiber from the carbs to result in a net carb intake of 200 uh about 235 grams which my percentage of carbohydrate after subtracting fiber is about 36 uh carbs and then also my average cholesterol intake daily uh uh dietary cholesterol intake is about 178 milligrams per day and that'll become more uh interesting slash important in the next uh upcoming slides so let's take a little bit look a deeper look at my crp values uh because i want to focus on those changes since uh that's one of the greatest changes that i've been able to make over the past uh few blood tests granted there are other improvements for lymphocyte percentage and white blood cells but those will be topics for another video so we can see that in 2020 the six measurements for c-reactive protein i range from relatively lower to 0.3 to as high as 1.01 and over the past three blood tests i've been able to reduce that back down to the 0.27 on on this blood test which is uh about half of what my average 20 20 20 20 value was now when considering that crc reactive protein increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk if you're interested in that data click on the link in the right corner i've made i made a video about that before uh so it's important to keep it low and to make sure it stays low over the duration of you know the decades to come so which variables are impacting crp what do i think is is what's impacting it so that i'm able to keep it at a relatively low level and i think dietary cholesterol may be a key player in the story so let's have a look at that data so first this is data for a blood cholesterol so total cholesterol is correlated with lower crp so we have crp on the y-axis and then my blood levels of total cholesterol on the x-axis and what we can see is that the higher my total cholesterol uh in blood the lower my levels of crp and that's a significant correlation uh but i should mention that's within the range my range of 133 to 185 and and you know others may have different data from me but i think we can all replicate the approach to try to identify the best food pattern that optimizes our biomarkers with the goal of minimizing disease risk and maximizing longevity so the obvious question when considering this association between my blood cholesterol levels with c-reactive protein is which dietary variables can impact total cholesterol if i can use diet to increase cholesterol then potentially i can reduce crp and as i mentioned in the last slide dietary cholesterol may be involved in this process so a higher dietary cholesterol intake is correlated with higher tc and this again is in my data and we can see that here so the higher my the average dietary cholesterol intake is the higher my blood levels of cholesterol are and that that again is a significant correlation as as seen by the uh p-value so then the obvious question is is dietary cholesterol correlated with crp is there a direct effect there or potential direct effect there and interestingly dietary cholesterol is not significantly correlated with crp so this suggests to me that this is maybe an indirect effect where more dietary cholesterol more total cholesterol and then for whatever reason whatever mechanism higher levels of blood cholesterol are involved in mechanisms that are reducing crp now total cholesterol tc equals the sum of hdl plus ldl and vldl so which of these are correlated with c reactive protein so i've got those correlations here and uh we can see that vldl is not correlated with the crp the p value is higher than 0.05 ldl is relatively close to significance with the p-value 0.1 0.1 but then hdl a higher hdl is inversely correlated with c-reactive proteins so higher hdl is correlated with lower c-reactive protein and based on the pv p-value that's a significant correlation so we can see that here visually the higher my hdl the lower the the crp so then the obvious question is okay how can i impact hdl how can i use my diet to optimize hdl and then the next obvious question is when considering that dietary cholesterol is uh correlated with my total blood levels of blood cholesterol is dietary cholesterol uh impacting hdl and based on the data no dietary cholesterol is not significantly correlated with hdl uh at least based on uh the stats here so what is correlated with hdl so in my data in looking at all of the macros and micros uh a higher sodium intake and a lower fructose intake total fructose including uh the amount that comes from sucrose sucrose is half fructose and glucose so sucrose divided by 2 equals fructose and then adding that to the uh pure fruit fructose that would be in my diet so higher sodium but lower fructose are individually correlated with hdl so first on the left we can see that the higher my salt intake and this is within the range of 1400 about 1400 milligrams of salt per day to about 26 25 2600 milligrams per day the higher my salt intake is correlated with a higher hdl and then conversely the higher my total fructose intake the lower my hdl so with that in mind i try to keep my fructose intake closer to the 70 to 80 gram or less if i can i mean i i love eating fruit out of a sweet tooth it's really tough for me to try to get it lower than that but i try because as you can see on the graph i've got um average daily fructose intakes of more than 110 grams per day on average uh so getting it to 70 to 80 around there is actually a win for me all right and it whereas univariate correlations are interesting i combined those two and put them in a model to see how much of the variability in hdl that that a multivariate model that included fructose and sodium uh could explain and we can see here based on the adjusted r squared that 40 percent of the variability in hdl can be explained by uh the the data for sodium and fructose so uh now that also begs the question what's the other 60 that can explain the variability for hcl so i'll look further and further further into that and stay tuned in later videos for that data so then the next obvious question is if sodium and fructose are impacting hdl are they directly impacting c-reactive protein or can they or are they correlated with changes in crp so uh first a higher sodium intake is correlated with a lower crp and this is uh statistically significant sorry uh with the p-value of 0.05 and again this is within the range of about 1500 to 2500 milligrams of salt per day now i'm uh for my next blood test i'm going to experiment with a little bit higher maybe somewhere in the 2700 milligrams of sodium per per day i don't want to go too high because it could potentially increase my blood pressure and i've noticed some correlations between higher creatinine and higher glucose which is going in the wrong direction so trying to find the amount of salt that potentially optimize hdl while not affecting the other biomarkers is is the goal now interestingly my average daily fructose intake was not correlated with crp so with all of these data in mind for the next blood test will increasing dietary cholesterol uh and sodium but limiting fructose further reduce crp while increasing hdl and i should mention too when i when i'm talking about an increase for dietary cholesterol i'll probably put this in another video but there's data that uh dietary cholesterol intakes up to 250 milligrams per day are associated with lowest risk of death for all all causes so lowest all-cause mortality risk going higher than 250 milligrams per day of dietary cholesterol is associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk if you remember from the earlier slide my average uh daily dietary cholesterol intake was 178 milligrams per day so i'm going to experiment getting uh closer to about 250 see if that raises my uh total cholesterol potentially ldl uh and uh increased my salt a little bit to try to get the hdl up and let's see if all of all those changes bring my c reactor protein further down i've had values as low as 0.2 milligrams per liter so it's it's possible to get it lower than where it is at 0.27 all right if you made it to the end thanks a lot you can find me lots of places online have a have a great day
