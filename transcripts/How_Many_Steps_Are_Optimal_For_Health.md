How many steps are optimal for health to address that let's take a look at this recently published paper that was a meta analysis of 11 studies that included more than 111,000 people and jumping straight into the data we've got steps per day on the x-axis which raises the question how are steps quantified objective step counting devices were used which were worn on the wrist and on the hip all right so back to the data on the y axis we've got the adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality in other words risk of death for all causes and then when compared with people who walked 2,000 steps per day as step counts increased all cause mortality risk was lower it was significantly reduced with an optimal dose being defined at about 8,800 steps per day now that was defined as an optimal dose because at higher step counts we can see that there was only a marginal lowering or step counts above 8,800 per day was only associated with a marginal reduction for all cause mortality rate risk and we can see that illustrated here on this table with the in in the middle we've got steps per day and on the right we've got the adjusted hazard ratio with the 95% confidence interval so just as a quick quick uh mention what that actually means so the data in parenthesis is the 95% confidence interval when it's lower than one a hazard ratio of one in this case it's a significant association so you can see for all three of the data in this in this table the hazard the 95% confidence interval is completely below one so each of these are significant associations so first when looking at the risk reduction for 16,000 steps we can see that the the adjusted hazard ratio is35 so we subtract that from a hazard ratio of one to get a 65% lower risk of death for all causes for people who walk 16,000 steps per day for the what was defined as the optimum dose though about 8,800 steps per day we can see that the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.4 so subtracting that from a hazard ratio of one yields a 60% reduction or a 60% lower risk of death for all causes for people who walked 8,800 steps per day in other words walking an additional 7,000 steps above 8,800 was only associated with a fire 5% lower risk of death for all causes that's why the authors of this meta analysis to find 8,800 steps as the quote unquote optimal dose because walking in an additional three and a half miles they gain a 5% uh lower risk of death for all cause mor mortality may not be as optimal as walking 800 steps all right so also minimum dose we can see that that was identified at 2500 steps so in other words relative to people who walked 2,000 steps per day getting an additional 500 steps per day was associated with an 8% lower risk of death for all causes all right but is this just healthy user bias do people who walk more just have generally healthier lifestyle uh lifestyles and that's what could explain this association for a lower risk of death for all causes so to account for that uh at least seven of the 11 studies included in their model adjustment for education level with the uh expectation that people who have higher levels of education may walk more comorbidities were adjusted included in the model in eight of the 11 studies so people who have more chronic health conditions may be more likely to walk less alcohol status was adjusted in nine of the 11 studies so excessive alcohol use probably the expectation would be less step counts and then 10 of the 11 studies adjusted for age bmi sex and smoking status but notably absent from this list is die quality in other words how much of the association for step counts with risk of death for all causes is explained by just generally healthier diets less ultra processed food intake none of the 11 studies adjusted for diet quality so hopefully future iterations of studies like this will include diet dietary quality as an adjustment variable uh in these in their model all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or a microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob green tea diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
