And so here's the human experiment this is a difficult experiment because it's an unpleasant experiment and getting subjects is always my my biggest problem so we gave people a very large they first of all they they had to starve overnight they came in and then we gave them a very large glucose load which is just really horrible we then pr their finger every few minutes to test their blood sugar level and we also wanted to know if this is working the way we think it's working then you should actually get an increase in co2 because you're using more oxygen as well as more sugar well the control experiment here is in green and this is done in a separate group of individuals and this is where they drink the glucose and you can see their blood glucose shoots up and very slowly after about an hour it comes down if we give you a burst of red light in this case only over a relatively small area of your back remember mitochondria talk to one another they'll run around saying hey something's happening i'm being driven harder and if i'm being driven harder you better be driven harder as well we do that and the blood glucose levels do not go up as much to be sure that we're doing the right thing we measured the co2 and yes the co2 goes up because they're using the oxygen and they're using the uh the glucose at the same time now interestingly 670 was the wavelength we used you can see 670 it's a bit on the it's it's it's kind of brightish red light we've now changed this and we've gone over to deeper red lights that you can't see so we've invited people in to have a cup of coffee um we've sat them down next to a panel which has got 850 nanometers in it can't see it it's very very very deep red light and we then invite them back a little bit later and we measure their blood glucose we measure their visual function everything improves so it's not this specific wavelength first of all secondly we can now introduce this into your world without you being aware of it and we can have physiological effects and they're good so if we think about someone with compromised mitochondria we can potentially think about exposing them to light that doesn't disturb them
