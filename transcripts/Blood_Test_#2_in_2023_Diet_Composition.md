# Blood Test #2 in 2023: Diet Composition

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number two in 2023 we saw that my biological age using dr morgan levine's pheno age was 17 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai we saw that it was 23 years younger than my chronological so with that in mind what's contributing to these data so let's start off with supplements and if you saw the first video in the series you saw that i supplemented with nmn with an average nmn intake of 340 milligrams per day and that was for the 42 42 day period from the day of the last test so test number one on january 23rd 2023 through the day before blood test number two march 5th of 2023 so that 42-day period i averaged 340 milligrams per day of nmn and note that for the seven consecutive day period before blood test number two in 2023 i averaged a thousand milligrams of nmn per day but note that there was no dramatic improvement or worsening of biological age data in the presence of nmn first when looking at levine's data we can see that i've had values at least as low as where it was for this test and similarly for aging.ai at least four measurements that were as low as the recent 27 without using nmn for aging.ai all right so that brings us to the other two supplements that are usually on my list or most of the time on my list i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine since then for about eight to nine months out of the year the non-summer months i supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day and that's it for supplements no other purported gear protectors or cenal linux which then brings us to diet so what diet composition corresponds to this test so note that this is the again the average 42-day period from the day of the last test through the day before test number two in 2023 and then we can see that i ate uh 47 different things or there were 47 different things on the list some of these are supplements so it's not all food and then this list is ranked in terms of grams starting from the highest and going to the lowest now note that these foods and food amounts have been purposely consistent for the past few tests and that's because after 40 plus blood tests since 2015 this diet including macros and micronutrients is consistently associated with relatively youthful biomarker data in my case with a few exceptions of course and for those who are familiar with the channel that includes my horvath epigenetic age homocysteine and dhea sulfate as examples now note that glycine is on the list here but it wasn't on the supplement list and i continued glycine supplementation for a few days after blood test number one but i stopped after i got the homocysteine data and if you remember i was trying to reduce homocysteine by taking glycine and that experiment didn't work now my diet isn't always purposefully clean i make sure i include at least one cheat day at most two if i try to go if i go more than two i'm starting i start to crave junk food and i don't i don't like that feeling so for this test there was one cheat day uh in between that 42 day period and i tried the tick tock trend of stuffing peanut butter and dates and then putting uh putting it in chocolate and to be honest it wasn't that great but uh so the cheat they had a full chocolate bar with some peanut butter and then um with with dates which which aren't junk all right so this list is ranked in ranked in grams which foods are top contributors for calories and that's what we can see here and note that this list is tracked with chronometer which i've used since 2015 and if you're interested in tracking your own diet with chronometer there'll be a discount link in the video's description so first what i'd like to highlight is energy or average daily calorie intake which for this test for that 42 day period was 21.77 calories per day and just to put that into perspective this is my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015. And my previous low was actually for test number one in 2023 where the average calorie intake was 21.94 calories per day now atop the list are sardines in terms of calories per day and then also notice that these this is the same top 10 foods that i also had for test number one which with some variation in the order but the same foods in terms of which foods are actually on the list in part because the biomarkers are looking mostly useful all right what about macronutrient composition so first let's start off with protein intake average was 95.3 grams per day which it equates to 17 and a half percent of total calories so what about fat intake that's we can see here average daily fat intake for that 42 day period that corresponds to this blood test was 82.3 grams which is 34 of total calories and if you're interested in the full fat breakdown including monounsaturated polyunsaturated omega-3 omega-6 and so on that's all there too all right so that brings us to carbohydrate intake so in terms of carbohydrate intake starting from the top we can see that it was 302 about 302 grams per day which seems like a lot but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber so for this test the average daily fiber intake is pretty close to where it's been for many tests about 86 grams per day and when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 217 grams per day now when multiplied that by four calories per gram and dividing it by total calories or the average daily calorie intake we can see that my net carbs is 39.9 of total calories now note that amongst fiber fiber is comprised of insoluble which is generally not fermented by gut bacteria and soluble which is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids in other words some fraction of that fiber is fermented into fat now with that in mind fiber then contributes 2.2 calories per gram and when multiplied by about 86 grams of fiber we can add 189 calories from fiber which is 8 0.7 percent of total calories we can add that to total fat as that fiber is converted into the short chain fatty acids so with that in mind now we can see that my net macros are about 43 fat about 40 net carbs and 17 and a half percent protein now digging a little deeper i do track total sugar intake more specifically i track fructose total fructose intake and that's because of the high strawberry uh amounts and then also carrots and beets have a very high fructose amount and relatively higher fructose in my in my data is associated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i try to keep my fructose intake relatively low for this test it was 58.1 grams note that sucrose is half fructose so 39.5 plus 37 divided by 2 yields a total fructose of 58 grams per day and to put that into perspective that's my close to that's close to my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracking in 2015. My previous low was uh for the previous test it was 58.5 grams of fructose per day all right so that brings us then to micronutrients how does that look for this test so you may have to go full screen to see the vitamins i wanted to get it all on one slide but the full vitamins and full minerals are shown there and first note that there is full rda coverage for all vitamins and minerals but then digging deeper many micronutrients are purposefully higher than the rda as i try to follow the correlate their correlations with blood biomarkers and just to highlight a few so niacin and folate you can see about 42 milligrams per day for niacin about a thousand micrograms for folate that's about two and a half times the rda magnesium's rda is 400 milligrams per day so i'm approaching two-fold there a little bit under two-fold higher than the rda but being twofold higher than the rda isn't a hard and fast rule because we can see that for vitamin k that's 17 times the rda and again this is trying to follow the data with the blood biomarkers as vitamin k is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong right direction than wrong all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links for the discounts will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
