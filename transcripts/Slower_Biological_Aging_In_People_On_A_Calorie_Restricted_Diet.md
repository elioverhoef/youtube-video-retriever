Calorie restriction is well known to extend lifespan in a variety of animal models for example in the data here on the left we see uh the lifespan extending effect of various levels of calorie restriction 47 cr 69 cr and 75 cr each of with each of which extends both average and maximal lifespan uh with similar data in the male mice on the right uh so 44 calorie restriction uh extended both average and maximal lifespan so these data are in mice and although the data is similar in a variety of other animal models including fly including flies yeast and worms um what about people so uh longitudinal studies uh using calorie restriction are impossible we'd have to do an 80 plus year study to see if cal restriction really extends uh average well at least average lifespan on people and we need it to be 120 years or more to see if it extends uh maximum so how can we get at this issue of whether or not calorie restriction will possibly impact health and lifespan in people so one way is to assess biological age and in a study done in 2018 uh calorie restriction was shown to slow biological aging so here what we're looking at is uh biological age on the on the y-axis and on the x-axis are the baseline 12 months of cr and 20 month 24 months of cr and this data is from the calorie study c-a-l-e-r-i-e um that again that was mentioned that that was performed in 2018. So um first this uh study was in a relatively young core cohort uh around thirty well 38 years uh was the average age uh just barely above the um normal or lean bmi definition with a bmi of 25.1 a bmi less than 25 is considered normal or lean um and then there were 70 uh ad libitum controls meaning they ate their normal diet and then 130 were randomized to undergo calorie restriction with the goal of 25 a 25 reduction in calories so first as we can see by the arrow there was no difference in uh biological age when comparing the ad-lib and cr groups so they're starting from the same biological age and actually interesting their biological age at 37 years was virtually identical to their chronological age of 38 years so what happened uh after a year of calorie restriction versus a year of not being calorie restricted so we can see that the ad lib group who ate their normal diet and didn't restrict their calories for the one year that passed they experienced a 0.71 increase in their biological age in contrast the cr group only aged by 0.11 years so we can see the 95 percent confident confidence intervals between these two groups of data so the shaded uh is the 95 confidence interval and the confidence intervals for both of these groups are not overlapping so the data are significantly different and uh this rate of aging was slowed uh similarly after two years of calorie restriction with the cr group experiencing 0.2 so only two-tenths of a year passed biologically but yet two years passed chronologically whereas the ad-lib group experienced the 1.4 year increase in their biological age uh for the two years that passed so a significant reduction in biological age over the two-year period that uh participants uh were on a cr diet so how much cr was able to uh impact uh biological age so that's that data we can see here that's a percentage of cr on the y-axis uh plotted against time so first uh for the first six months of the study uh probably more people were most people were you know uh super excited i guess the calorie restrict and the cr group reduced their calories by an average of 480 calories per day down from 2467 which was their baseline intake which was a reduction of about 20 percent now for the remaining 18 months of the study they weren't able to uh the cr group wasn't able to restrict as much uh so there was about a nine to ten percent reduction in their calorie intake so thereby reducing their daily calorie intake by 234 calories and cumulatively over the 24 month study the cr group reduced their calorie intake by an average of about 12 percent so were there differences in biological age depending on the level of cr did the group that within the cr group did uh subjects who had more cr a higher restriction experience an even lower biological age compared to people who restricted less and um although it looks like there are differences so what we're looking at here is biological age again plotted on the y-axis against time and you can see the ad-lib group in the dark blue circles again that 1.4 year increase in biological age over the two-year period so when comparing the subjects who had less than 10 cr the light blue circles versus 10 or more cr the dark blue circles although those data look like they're different they were not statistically uh significantly different so one could argue that um having more than 10 cr or less than 10 cr you can get you could get the uh biological slowing effects of calorie restriction so which biomarkers are included in this biological age calculator and how good is it i haven't shown that data so let's just take a quick look at that so the biological age calculator that calculated that they use is called called the clomera dubai biological age and that was first published uh in 2006. So it contains 10 biomarkers and age so albumin alkaline phosphatase blood urea nitrogen c-react protein creatinine uh glycated hemoglobin which is actually glucose levels uh they calculated uh glycate hba1c from the glucose levels uh systolic blood pressure total cholesterol uric acid and white blood cell count now notice uh that five of these biomarkers are on uh levine's phenotypic age biological age calculator which which i've talked about in many videos so there is some overlap between these two biological age calculators so uh the this biological age calculator the clomera dubal um biological age calculator is strongly correlated with chronological age in the calorie study and that's what we can see here uh so the correlation between these biomarkers with chronological age as a box with the red rectangle below was 0.88 which is a strong correlation for the biological age calculator with chronological age now these data are in a sample size of 200 subjects it's almost always better to have larger larger data sets because if they if an effect is actually significant you'd see it in a very large cohort whereas with smaller subject sizes the data could be more variable and the effect may be real or not because it's of the sample size to the small sample size so what about in a larger study so they looked at the correlation between the 10 biomarkers and age so 11 with chronological age in this larger study 2009 to 2010 nhanes which is the national health and nutrition examination survey so in that study there was data for 7 700 blood test data and blood pressure systolic blood pressure data for 7 700 subjects and we can see with the red rectangle at the corner that the correlation coefficient for this biological age calculator with chronological age was even a little bit better at 0.92 now for a little bit of perspective uh levine's phenotypic age calculator has a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and 0.96 in two large studies that included more than 9 000 subjects so one could argue that the clomera dubal method kdm is similar in its correlation with morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator so what about all-cause mortality risk so there weren't any pretty pictures for this but uh the clomera dubal biological age calculator has been shown to be a better predictor of all cause mortality risk when compared with chronological age in in a large study and hence three which included 9 000 plus subjects so just to break that down real quick so age increasing age is associated with an increase all-cause mortality risk so basically they found that this biological age calculator was better better able to predict all-cause mortality risk than chronological age so that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
