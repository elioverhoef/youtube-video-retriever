# Did High-Dose NMN Mess Up The Epigenetic Pace Of Aging?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number four in 2023 i sent blood to gen infinity for nad analysis to test the effect of 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day on nad and on that day in an earlier video we saw that i raised my nad levels to 67.4 micromolar using 600 mig of nicotinic acid per day now note that my baseline ned levels are 20 to 25 micromolar which is without any nad precursors so 600 milligram of nicotinic acid per day raised an ad by two to three times higher above my baseline on the same day as that test though i also sent blood to true diagnostic for epigenetic analysis and as a quick mention there are discount links for both of these companies in the video description so if you want to measure your own nad or epigenetic age those links will be in the video's description so on the same day as the nad test i we saw that my doneita pace which measures the epigenetic pace of aging was 0.98 as highlighted in red and that's my worst epigenetic pace of aging score 0.98 over 11 tests so then that raises the question did high dose nicotinic acid or high nad being higher than 60 micromolar cause this 0.98 for the epigenetic pace of aging so if i can increase nad to higher than 60 micromolar but without nicotinic acid will don and paste again look like an outlier so to test that in december of 202 three i supplemented with 2 g of nmn per day or 2,000 mg and then once again sent blood to gfinity for nad analysis and on that day in an early video we saw that i again was able to raise nad to greater than 60 micromolar at 61 micromolar so then that raises the question did high dose nmn mess up d need and pace if yes it's a high nad issue in other words i'll have two different methods of raising nad to greater than 60 micromolar nicotinic acid and nmn so if donita pace is still messed up that suggests it's a high nad problem too ned being too high but if it's no if highd dose nn did not mess up denan pace that suggests that it's a high nicotinic acid or nicotinic acid being too high as a potential reason for why donan pace was so high all right so results from the december 11th test have come in for from true diagnostic and on that day the same day as the 61 microt 4 nmn we can see that my donita pace was 0.74 which is my lowest don pa donita pace over 11 test so that's good news for nmn for those who use nmn relative to other ned precursors so to answer the question did highd do nmn mess up dita past it certainly did not and that indicates or suggests that this is a highd do nicotinic acid problem in terms of messing up the epigenetic pace of aging now with that in mind in earlier videos we saw that i've used 60 mig of nicotinic acid per day and that did not mess up thean past so i'm sporadically taking very low doses of nicotinic acid on workout days which is when i uh posit that i may need the nad nad boost the most relative to other days now i wish this is where the story ended but unfortunately there may be bad news for nmn that's because highd does nmn may have messed up tm length and it's important to mention that true diagnostic doesn't measure tm length like other methods uh including qpcr or fish it uses a dna methylation estimation of or it's a dna methylation estimation of tiir length in other words it's an it's an epigenetic measurement of tiir length so i have 11 tests for tm length all of them are shown here and on the same day as a 61 micromolar tm length the estimated tm length based on dna methylation was 7.06 7.06 kilobases now note that for eight tests in 2023 that's my lowest value in fact none of the other seven tests in 2023 were less than 7.1 kilobases so that's a little strange to start now it's also in the same ballpark as my worst three or worst first three t length measurements which were all al also less than 7.1 kilobases now did nn cause this is this just random fluctuation or random noise i don't know but with that in mind i'm off high do nicotinic acid and i'm off high do uh nmn uh currently going to use as i mentioned the lowd do nicotinic acid 60 milligram per day or less but then also if you've been paying attention to the channel and you're a familiar watcher i'm going to use things like trigonelline or one methyl nicotinic acid in relatively low doses to try to impact nad and i just ordered uh fenu greek seeds which are have actually the highest concentration of one methyl nicotinate or trigonelline so we'll see if that will increase nad in future videos all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buy hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing and a quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob green tea diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die tri brand as i've got on here in every video that link and all the other links will be in the video description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
