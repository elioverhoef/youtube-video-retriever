Glutathione restoration reduces oxidative damage and inflammation while improving mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity in older adults so first what is glutathione so uh glutathione is a tripeptide which means that it's comprised of three amino acids including glutamate cysteine and glycine and it's the major it's the most abundant intracellular antioxidant in terms of intracellular concentration now glutathione has important roles in maintaining mitochondrial function in affecting gene expression in the nucleus and affecting protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum er just as a few examples of its uh importance now i mentioned that it's the most abundant intracellular antioxidant how does it do that so uh just as an example glutathione is used to degrade reactive oxygen species and in this case hydrogen peroxide so in the presence of glutathione gsh glutathione peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the hydrogen peroxide is degraded into water and correspondingly glutathione becomes oxidized thereby forming gssg which is glutathione disulfide so essentially two molecules of glutathione become bonded together and then oxidized glutathione gssg can be reduced back to glutathione by gssg reductase and also in the presence of reduced nad phosphate nadph so while these data illustrate glutathione's importance however glutathione declines during aging and that's what we can see here so glutathione levels are on the y axis plotted against age and what we can see is a steady decline for glutathione levels during aging a significant decline now the obvious question is can the age-related decline for glutathione be reversed so first let's take a look at a study that that tried to uh do that so here we're looking at again glutathione levels on the y-axis and this is glutathione levels in red blood cells and what we can see is when comparing young adults versus older adults so the young adults were 31 to 40 years and the older adults were 60 to 75 years and this is a very small study with 16 total subjects we can once again see the glutathione levels are lower in older adults when compared with young subjects now when considering that glutathione is comprised of those three amino acids glutamate cysteine and glycine are there age-related changes for these amino acids as a potential explanation for why total glutathione declines during aging so that's what they measured and that's what we see here so levels of glycine cysteine and glutamate in red blood cells in young subjects and in the older adults so uh first we can see that they were well i should say there were no significant differences for glutamate 463 versus 464 between the two groups but there were significant declines for glycine and cysteine in the older adults so 55 lower levels of glycine and old 24 percent lower levels of cysteine and old when compared with young so then the obvious question is can restoring glycine and cysteine increase glutathione so to try to do that the authors of this study uh performed the two-week study in which they supplemented 0.1 grams per kilogram of body weight per day for glycine 0.13 grams per kilogram body weight per day for n-acetyl cysteine as a cysteine donor and then for a 70 kilogram person those uh those doses uh equate to a significant amount you know a lot this isn't the amount amount these aren't amounts that you can get from a normal diet seven grams per day of glycine and 9.3 grams per day of n-acetyl cysteine so what happened to glycine cysteine and glutamate levels in older adults that were supplemented with glycine and acetylcysteine and what we can see is that they were restored to relatively youthful levels so uh it went from 218 up to 529 for glycine and then for cysteine up from about 20 to about 31. So uh okay the individual amino acid levels were restored so what was the impact on glutathione levels and that's what we can see here so for older adults that were supplemented with glycine plus and acetyl cysteine glutathione levels were restored to youthful levels now these data were in a two-week study and although they reported a reduced lipid oxidative damage as a result of glycine and n-acetylcysteine supplementation which i haven't shown you here if you're interested in that data i'll post a link to this study in the description uh so the authors of this study then last year posted a longer study a 24-week study where they attempted where they attempted to restore glutathione levels by again supplementing with glycine and n-acetyl cysteine and then looking at the impact of that supplementation on various health-related parameters so just as a quick overview of what they saw uh and what they saw in part because there were many findings that they saw changes to i'm not i'm not going to go through all of them there's just not enough time but uh i'll also link to that study if you're interested uh it'll be in the description so just uh shortly they uh briefly they reduced uh they saw reductions in lipid and dna oxidative damage and reductions in inflammation and then they saw improvements from mitochondrial function insulin insulin sensitivity and a few other measures so let's go through that data so first i mentioned they uh performed a 24 week study with the same doses of glycine and n-acetyl cysteine in the previous shorter two-week study so first what was the impact on levels of glutathione in this case levels of glutathione in red blood cells so first looking at young adults versus older adults and again they this is data in a very small study whether this would apply to the uh general population in larger cohorts is unknown uh but it's encouraging data as we'll see so first notice that uh once again uh older adults have lower levels of glutathione more than half so 0.8 versus 1.8 in young adults and then they looked at two time points so 12 weeks of supplementation and then 24 weeks of supplementation which is what we can see here and then they only supplemented the older adults they didn't supplement the younger young adults in this study so what they saw was after 12 and 24 weeks levels of glutathione were increased relative to baseline so 0.8 went to 1 and 1.6 for levels of glutathione so they essentially double glutathione levels in this 24 week study now if supplementation is actually making an impact when we remove supplementation we'd expect to see a reversion back to baseline and to assess that they looked at data 12 weeks after supplementation so no supplementation for 12 weeks after 24 weeks of supplementation and then that's what they saw so glutathione levels fell essentially back to where around baseline was so 0.9 and these data are visualized here so we're looking at red blood cell levels of glutathione on the y axis and then 0 12 24 and 36 weeks after uh after that and um we can see first that red blood cell levels are lower red blood cell levels of glutathione are lower and older adults and then after 12 and 24 weeks of supplementation we see significant increases in glutathione levels in the older adults and then after stopping supplementation we see glutathione going back to where it was without supplementation so when considering glutathione glutathione's role as an antioxidant what's the effect of increasing glutathione on oxidative damage to lipids and dna in older adults and that's what we see here so first we're looking at genomic damage as uh measured by eight hydroxy deoxyguanosine and this is a dna oxidation biomarker and then they also looked at lipidox lipid oxidative damage in this case measured by plasma levels of f2 isoprostanes so first looking at young versus old we can see that both dna damage dna and lipid oxidative damage were at least fourfold higher in the older adults when compared with the younger adults so what impact did supplement supplementation have on oxidative damage to dna and lipids and we can see significant reductions for both uh oxidative damage to dna and lipids as a result of cysteine uh n-acetyl cysteine and glycine supplementation uh so about 107 for dna oxidative damage to about 60 to then about 40. Each of those uh changes are statistically significant and then for lipid oxidative damage we see values from about 186 to 64 and even lower to about 48 after 24 weeks of supplementation so once again if if the supplementation is is causing these effects when we remove supplementation we'd expect to see a reversion back to baseline levels or in that direction and that's what we see here uh after the 24-week time point when compared with 12 weeks of not supplementing with glycine and acetylcysteine we see levels of dna oxidative damage and lipid oxidative damage now increasing in the absence of glycine and acetylcysteine so inflammation was also reduced and that's we can see here so for inflammation i'm showing you levels of il6 tnf alpha and high sensitivity c-reactive protein which i've talked talked about in a lot of videos so uh first we can see that older adults have uh much higher levels of each of these inflammatory markers when compared with young for il-6 it's more than nine-fold elevated tnf-alpha is about twice as high or actually tnf-alpha and high-sensitivity reactive protein are about twice as high in older adults when compared with young so what impact did supplementation have on these inflammatory parameters and in every case inflammation is reduced so aisle 6 went from 4.8 to 2.7 to 1.1 i mean that's a 75 reduction tnf alpha went from 98 to 80 to 59 again about a 30 reduction and then high sensitivity c-reactor protein also about a 30 reduction 4.9 and 3.5 to 3.2 so once again if supplementation is causing these reductions for inflammation when we remove supplementation we'd expect to see increases in inflammation and that's that's what they saw so uh inflammation uh for il-6 went from 1.1 to two tnf alpha 59 to 73 and high sensitivity c react to protein from 3.2 up to 3.9 so significant increases in inflammation in the absence of glycine and n-acetyl cysteine and significant reductions in the presence of these amino acids uh as so reductions in inflammation as a result of supplementation with these amino acids excuse me and started there for a second all right so i've shown you what was reduced so what was uh increased or improved and uh in this in this slide we're going to see increased systemic fat oxidation and improved mitochondrial function in the glycine and and acetyl cysteine supplemented older adults so first we're looking at the fasting respiratory quotient now the rq is uh an index of substrate oxidation which means are you burning fat for fuel systemically are you burning mostly fat are you burning protein are you burning carbohydrate so as the rq gets closer to 0.7 you're burning mostly fat for fuel and that's systemically um so first we can see that older adults have higher rq values when compared with younger adults which suggests that younger adults have uh a greater predominance of fat oxidation systemically when compared with older adults who have a little bit less systemic fat oxidation so what effect did glycine and n-acetyl-cysteine supplementation have on systemic fat oxidation using rq as that measure and what we can see is that rq measures started to fall in the supplemented older adults from 0.84 to 0.79 to 0.77 each of these differences are statistically significant which suggests that in older adults supplementation with glycine and n-acetyl cysteine improves systemic fat oxidation now again if supplementation is causing these effects when we remove supplementation do we see the opposite and and these effects uh being lost and that's what they uh saw so when looking at 12 weeks of stopping supplementation compared with the 24-week time point we can see that the rq values without supplementation start to go back to where they were at baseline so the obvious question is when considering that rq going closer to 0.7 is a measure of systemic fat oxidation is mitochondrial fat oxidation involved in this process so that's what we can see here uh represented visually so first mitochondrial fat oxidation in old was worse when compared with young and then after supplementing with glycine and acetylcysteine we can see improvements of both the 12 and 24 weak time points now if older adults are or are spending less uh if less if there's less mitochondrial fat oxidation in older adults at baseline uh to to meet the energy demands of the cell it would make sense that the that they're also having an increase in sugar oxidation with glucose oxidation as that measure and that's we see here so older adults when compared with younger adults have higher levels of mitochondrial sugar oxidation but after supplementing we can see that sugar oxidation levels are reduced in the older adults and in fact down to levels that are similar to that found in younger adults so what was also improved as a result of supplementation with glycine and acetylcysteine high doses of both of those is insulin sensitivity so that's what we're looking at here uh so plasma levels of glucose plasma levels of insulin and then the mult the multiplic sorry again multiplying both of these measures can be used to calculate insulin resistance uh using homa ir as the metric so first we can see that older adults have uh higher levels of glucose insulin and homa ir when compared with the younger adults and then after supplementing for 12 and 24 weeks with the exception of glucose at the 12-week time point each of these measures were improved so for glucose 5.4 to 4.9 and this is in millimoles it's about a nine milligrams per deciliter change for going from zero weeks to 24 weeks of supplementation and then insulin levels were cut by more than half after 24 weeks of supplementation and then uh also insulin resistance was cut by more homaira was cut by more than half as a result of glycine and acetyl system supplementation so again if if supplementation is causing is causing these effects when we remove supplementation we'd expect to see these changes going in the opposite direction because the the the initiating factor for these changes is being removed and that's what we see here so plasma levels of glucose insulin and insulin resistance as measured by home ir all reverted uh back towards baseline which suggests that supplementation with glycine and acetyl system was causing these changes so just as a brief summary uh so adding high dose glycine and n-acetyl cysteine restored levels of glutathione to those found in uh younger adults but in older adults and that improved four hallmarks of aging at least that's the data that they looked at they didn't look at the others i wonder if those other hallmarks would have been improved so the hallmarks that they improved were genomic instability using dna oxidative damage as one measure of that uh nutrient sensing in terms of insulin sensitivity that was improved and then mitochondrial function was improved as a result of glutathione restoration and then inflammation was reduced so also improved that i didn't show in this video were was a physical and cognitive function measures of both of those and then plasma markers of endothelial and kidney function well actually in addition also triglycerides were reduced so uh for more info as i mentioned uh that this paper and all the other papers that i mentioned in the video will be in the description uh so that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for thanks for watching and listening and have a great day
