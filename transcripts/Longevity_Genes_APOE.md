# Longevity Genes: APOE

Apoe is associated with longevity independent of alzheimer's disease uh this is a paper that was published about three weeks ago so let's have a look at that data so first what we're looking at is survival on the y-axis plotted against age and this is data in humans uh for carriers of apoe2 which is defined as having two e2 alleles or one e2 and one e3 allele in blue uh apoe3 defined as having two e3 alleles or apoe4 uh in red defined as having one e3 and one e4 allele or two e4 alleles so uh at 50 survival the that's the time uh at which half of the population is alive and the other uh half of the population has died we can assess average lifespan and what we can see is that average lifespan was longest for the april e2 carriers in blue at about 95 years a smaller lifespan a shorter lifespan was found for the apoe3 carriers in green at about 91 or 92 years and then the shortest life span of the mall was present for apoe4 carriers in red at about 89 years so about a five to six year difference between apoe2 and apoe4 so that explains the first half of the title of this paper apoe2 is associated with longevity what about its association with alzheimer's or death related to alzheimer's disease and that's we're looking at here so first comparing apoe4 carriers versus apoe3 carriers when comparing uh the presence or absence of alzheimer's disease a.d there was an increased mortality risk regardless of the subjects uh had alzheimer's no ad or did not have alzheimer's no ad in april e4 carriers when compared with apoe3 conversely what about april e2 carriers versus apoe3 well there we can see a reduced mortality risk regardless if the subjects had alzheimer's disease or did not have alzheimer's disease so hence the conclusion that apoe2 is associated with longevity independent of alzheimer's disease now this isn't the only study to have identified associations for apoe2 uh the apoe gene with mortality risk uh this is data from a larger study uh about 106 000 subjects so first let's have a look at the dementia associated mortality which is relevant to alzheimer's disease so uh first when comparing um april e4 carriers with the referent uh april e3 we can see that there's an increase significantly increased mortality risk related to dementia for the apoe4 carriers so having one e4 allele is associated with a 2.33 fold increased risk of dementia associated mortality compared to 803 and even worse carrying two alleles e4 e44 was associated with a 6.49 uh fold increased risk of dementia associated mortality when compared with apoe3 uh carriers two having two alleles of e3 so uh dementia associated mortality is just one outcome related to death what about all cause mortality which includes all the deaths related to cardiovascular disease alzheimer's disease cancer etc so that's we're looking at here and again we can see that compared to apoe3 e33 uh having one allele for 804 was associated with a 10 percent increase all-cause mortality risk and having two e4 alleles was associated with a 43 increased all-cause mortality risk so conversely having one allele of apoe2 so e32 here was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk when compared with uh apoe3 so associations are interesting which is what i've shown you but what about causation so to test that uh shinohara's group the the group that i mentioned on the previous slide they engineered mice to um have either apoe2 in blue april week 3 in green 8 boy 4 in red and then they completely knocked out the april e4 gene in purple and this is a survival plotted against age so how is lifespan affected so again just like the human data although that was association this potentially more gets more at causation here we can see that the uh mice that had the apoe2 gene uh lived the longest uh had the longest average lifespan the apoe3 carriers lived intermediate and the able e4 carriers lived the shortest again just like the human data so from this we can conclude that apoe beyond its associations may have a causative role in impacting longevity in people so what's my apoi status i'm interested obviously in living longer than anyone that's ever lived before so having an apoe2 genotype would be a good start to get there so i've had this uh measured i've had the snips for apoe that are relevant to lifespan rs-429358 and rs-7412 um measured and uh as we can see below uh my apoe genotype for the rs429358 is uh t and t and for these rs-7412 it's c and c and based on uh that genotype i'm the apoe3 uh uh i'm an april e3 carrier so um what are your able e what's your apoe status uh leave leave a note in the comments below uh let's see who's got some longevity jeans all right that's all i've got for now uh for more info you can find me lots of places online have a great day
