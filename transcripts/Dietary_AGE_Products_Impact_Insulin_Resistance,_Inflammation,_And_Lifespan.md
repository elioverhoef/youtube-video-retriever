Dietary intake of advanced glycation end products also known as age products impact insulin resistance inflammation and lifespan although i'd like to jump right into the data it's important to first define uh how they're formed and where they're found in food so first in looking at the simplified cartoon here uh we can see that starting from uh bread when you heat bread for uh some period of time that forms the you know the brown the crisp and um of the molecules that are found in the brown and the crisp are age products uh amongst other molecules but some of the molecules that are or metabolites that are found in there are age products so two of the age products that are found uh are formed during the browning process uh i've i've shown them here so n6 carboxymethyl lysine also known as cml and methylglyoxal so i'm going to talk about those two h products a lot uh as i go through this uh video so where is uh where are age products found uh in the diet so um this is a cml content so again carboxymethyl lysine uh in a few different foods and just illustrating how uh uh cooking foods at a high a temperature higher than 100 degrees celsius 200 degrees 212 degrees fahrenheit anything higher than boiling temperature will create uh more age products so just looking first at raw cashews we see the cml content uh 67 30 kilo units per 100 grams of cashews but then roasting there's a greater formation of age products around 3 000 units now it isn't just cashews that have this issue so roasting sunflower seeds we see also around a 2000 unit increase in cml content because of roasting but then going to something like beef beef has a uh relatively lower uh cml content when it's raw but when you broil it grill it or pan fry we can see a dramatic increase you know from 10 fold for for broiling and grilling to 14 fold increase in age product cml content for beef now i'm not uh using this data to to demonize beef just to illustrate that there may be healthier ways to prepare it if your goal is to reduce age product content so one way is by stewing the beef so cooking it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time we can see that stewing beef has about a three-fold less age product content compared with broiling and grilling around a four to five fold less than pan frying and only a you know about a three and a half fold increase compared to raw so stewing may be better in terms of each product content so i haven't shown you why age products are important so let's have a look at that data in terms of uh age products and their impact on health and lifespan so first reducing age product dietary age products increases lifespan in male c-57 black six j mice now there's no data for females this is the uh data that exists uh so first um they fed a mice um a regular age product a regular diet containing normal amounts of age products and then a lower age product diet that they made by heating the animal pellet at a lower temperature so uh first we can see that the macronutrient composition of both diets are are the same so any effects we would see would not be because of macronutrient composition however you can obviously see that the age product content is half in the low age diet so what effect did eating the low age diet have on lifespan so here we're looking at uh survival so this is a survival curve plotted on the y axis uh against um age in weeks on the x-axis so um when comparing the uh 50 survival which they've already highlighted uh for me with the black line uh we can see that eating the low age diet increased lifespan as indicated by the arrow both average and maximal lifespan compared to the regular age diet so an obvious question when seeing these data is well did the mice eat less food on the low age diet and that would basically in you know induce a calorie restriction which could explain this lifespan extending effect of the quote-unquote low-age diet so they measured measured that and uh first we can see in the inset of this uh figure here that food intake between the two groups was not different so the lifespan extending effect of the low age diet was not related to uh eating less food uh also interestingly though in the bigger picture the body weight uh plotted uh on the y-axis against age uh we can see that the body weight for the low age diet fed mice in the black triangles was lower albeit not statistically significant was lower than the regular age diet for the majority of the study and then finally became statistically significant starting at 96 weeks on the diet so this data would suggest that eating the low age diet increased improved metabolism so the uh their metabolism is more efficient so they're because they're not eating less food they're eating the same amount of food but they have a lower body weight which suggests more efficient uh utilization of nutrients uh so that they're not uh carrying more body fat because of an inefficient metabolism all right so that's the effect of a low-wage diet on lifespan an extension of lifespan on the low-wage diet what's the effect of a high age diet plus calorie restriction which is the gold standard of lifespan extension so first i'm looking at the diets between the three groups so we have the regular diet a cr diet and then a cr diet fed a high amount of age products which they heated the mouse pellet for longer resulting in more age products in the uh mouse food so before we go into that uh first it's important to note that the macronutrient composition of the three diets between these three different groups regular crnc are high was not different so protein fat carbs and calories all the same between the diets and also the cml and methylglyoxal mg the two h products that they quantified was similar between the regular and the cr groups so basically the food is the same for the regular and sierra groups but the cr animals are eating less in this case 40 less so you can see food intake grams per day where the cr groups were eating three grams a day versus the regular group which uh we're eating five grams a day so that's a 40 cr now correspondingly because the cr mice were eating less food they were also eating less age products as as shown here with the cml and methylglyoxal mg so the cr mice because they're eating less food they're also eating less age products so to account for that the authors of this study created a high age product diet that were fed to mice that were calorie restricted and that's we see we can see there so the um although the macronutrient composition of the diets between these three groups was similar they uh heated the pellet longer for the cr high age products fed mice so that it had a higher amount of cml and mg and uh thereby resulting as shown in the lower uh data thereby resulting in about a two and a half fold increase in cml daily cml intake for cr high h products versus just cr and also an increase of about 55 percent for the high age product cr group versus regular cr so what effect did eating more age products have for calorie restriction when compared with the regular cr diet so here are the lifespan curves or survival sorry uh so cumulative survival in the y axis plotted against age so first in looking at the average uh lifespan we can see that obviously cr as well known increased lifespan um from about 100 weeks uh average to uh around 120 it also increased the maximal lifespan to from about 110 to 130 uh weeks so what affected the uh high cr high age product plus cr uh group have with lifespan so um that data is indicated by the gray circles and we can see that eating more age products but the same amount of food on a cr diet shortened lifespan so when considering that a low age diet increases lifespan and a high age product diet plus cr will shorten lifespan this suggested that dietary age product intake is a very very powerful uh effector of lifespan so what about insulin resistance and inflammation so um so first we're looking at the data for insulin levels in 24 month old mice that were fed a high or a low age product die for their lifespan so as we can see the insulin levels in the low age product diet had about half the insulin levels and they didn't show you the glucose levels which weren't different between the groups but one measure of insulin sensitivity is the homa ir index which is essentially a multiplication of insulin times glucose and although the authors didn't evaluate if that was statistically significant in the study or not because they reported the data for insulin and glucose we can see that the mice on the regular age product diet had a homa ir of 20 up you know 23.7 which is uh more than double the uh homa r ir value of the low-wage product diet which uh suggests that the animals on the low-age product diet were more insulin sensitive relative to the regular aged diet group all right so what is the what's the effect of dietary age products on inflammation so here we're looking at the effect of a high age product diet or a low h product diet on tnf alpha on the y-axis in picograms per milliliter as a as one indicator of inflammation and again this data is both these data are in mice so regardless if the mice were on a high fat diet hf or on a low fat diet lf we can see that animals that were fed the low age product diet were had had lower inflammation as indicated by lower tnf alpha so um everything i've shown you so far is in mice uh is there similar data similar data in humans i mean it's nice to have animal studies but we want to know if this stuff is going to impact health and and disease risk and lifespan in humans so there's a meta-analysis of uh randomized controlled trials rcts where they compared a low age product diet versus high so this is an intervention this isn't an association so in five studies uh it's uh that that reported homa ir values eating a low age product diet decreased home ir so eating less age products more insulin sensitive in six studies that fed a low age or a high age product diet the low-wage product diet was uh basically induced lower levels of inflammation as indicated by tnf alpha so so far it would appear that the at least some of this data for the mice and humans is similar at least in terms of insulin resistance and inflammation so what about disease risk um and actually i should say what about lifespan right ideally we want to have dietary intake of age products whether it's cml methylgloss or others and uh you know what's their association with longevity but clearly that's a very difficult study to do we would be decades of data on people it hasn't been done yet so we can look at uh dietary intake of age products and their association with disease risk uh and all cause mortality risk to uh you know provide some more insight on this uh story so first uh higher diet higher dietary cml content is associated with pancreatic cancer in men and breast cancer in women so first we're looking at the uh pancreatic cancer in men data so uh we're looking at cml in quintile so going from one to five lowest dietary cml intake is one highest cml uh dietary cml intake is five and when looking at the uh fully adjusted model uh not partially adjusted with the other hazard ratios at three and four there so they adjusted for many things but not everything when looking at the fully adjusted model when comparing a low dietary intake of cml with the higher intakes in this case the fourth and fifth quintiles we see at 54 and a 40 increased incidence or increased risk of having pancreatic cancer so higher dietary age uh dietary cml intake is associated with a higher pancreatic cancer incidence in men now similar data is obtained for women so again we're looking here at quintiles of cml dietary cml intake so q1 is a low dietary intake of cml h product cml and q5 is a high dietary intake and similarly in the fully adjusted model when compared with q1 the lowest intake of dietary cml we can see that highest the highest two quintiles of of cml intake q4 and q5 were associated with a 24 and a 30 percent significant uh 24 and 30 increased risk for breast cancer so having a higher intake of dietary age products uh so far not uh it's associated with with worse outcomes now all of the data doesn't show that though in a study published two weeks ago actually converse data was reported so uh an 11 decreased all-cause mortality risk acn risk for the highest versus the lowest intake of dietary cml was reported in men they didn't find an association between age product intake with women um so this is opposite you know the hypothesis being for dietary age products being uh bad for health and disease risk because this is this association suggests that dietary age products would be associated with a lower all-cause death from all causes are risk so let's have a little bit a little deeper look at the that data so in the previous slide i showed you data for cancer in men and women so first they reported um dietary intake of cml with quartiles this time q1 to q4 so lowest intake of dietary cml q1 highest intake q4 and for cancer mortality they didn't see an association of significant association for cancer mortality with dietary cml intake similarly they didn't see an association between dietary cml intake with cbd mortality uh but they did find a significant association for non-cancer non-cbd mortality which is a big box it could be lots of different things it could be respiratory diseases it could be accidents it could be a lot of different things but nonetheless they found a 26 decreased risk of non-cancer non-cbd mortality in the fully adjusted model um for uh in association with dietary age products now this is the only study that's been reported for uh the association between age products dietary age product intake with all cause mortality so more data is definitely needed to uh you know to uh discern what's the true story uh but so far based on the cancer data and this one study i'd suggest and based on the data for the insulin resistance and inflammation story both in mice and humans and the animal data showing uh you know the effects of age products and lifespan i'd suggest that there's more than enough data to support the hypothesis that reducing dietary age products uh may be an important strategy to improve health and potentially uh lifespan in people all right that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
