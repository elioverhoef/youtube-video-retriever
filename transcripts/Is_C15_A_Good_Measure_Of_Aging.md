# Is C15 A Good Measure Of Aging?

## Transcript

C-15 otherwise known as pentadecanoic acid has been in the aging news a lot lately and that's in part because of studies like this where it was shown that it shares clinically relevant cell-based activities with leading longevity enhancing compounds and also studies like this where pentanoic acid deficiency has been associated with accelerated aging associated diseases but more specifically is this fatty acid this saturated fatty acid c-15 is it good measure of aging so let's start off with the bad news c15 or pentanoic acid is not associated with a younger epigenetic age and that's what we'll see here so on the left we've got levels of saturated fatty acids so c15 is a saturated fatty acid as it doesn't have any double bonds with c-15 indicated there so fa150 is c-15 or pentadecanoic acid and their levels are plotted against two gold standard epigenetic blocks pheno age and grim age and then we're looking at the age acceleration so this is how is your epigenetic age relative to your chronological age if it's higher than your chronological age that's an positive age acceleration if it's lower than your chronological age that's a negative age acceleration that's actually what we want we want to have a lower epigenetic age relative to our chronological age all right so in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at zero so when when the 95% confidence interval that's the horizontal line to the left and right of the black circles if that's completely to the left of the red line or completely to the right of the red line we have a significant association and for c-15 unfortunately for both epigenetic aging clocks the 95% confidence interval overlaps with that red line in other words c-15 is not associated with a younger epigenetic age at least based on these two gold standard epigenetic clocks so why we're on this page what is significantly associated with a younger epigenetic age and we can see two other saturated fatty acids c22 and c24 which are significantly associated with a younger pheno age now the importance of these two fatty acids is that peanut intake can increase their plasma levels now it's important to note that whether in this study that their levels were being influenced by peanut intake or it's just a maybe it's a genetic marker where people who had uh relatively higher plasma levels have a better ability to make these uh fatty acids in blood intake isn't the only way that we can increase their levels in plasma they can also be made endogenously which way that story goes i'm not sure but at least these two longchain saturated fatti acids are associated with a younger dna methylation uh pheno ag a dna methylation clock for pheno age now the good news though is that c15 so c15 the the 15 c-15 fatty acid pentadecanoic acid when that's bound to cholesterol which is known as a cholesterol esther so c150 that is significantly associated with a younger epigenetic age and that's what we'll see here so at the top we've got the ce so that's cholesterol esters and then we're interested in the c15 so the cholesterol eser that contains pentadecanoic acid on the left we've got levels of dna and phenoage so this is the epigenetic clock again that applies to pho and then grim ag also an epigenetic clock so we're looking for c15 so for that we go to to to the carbon chain length we highlight 15 so now we've got c5 and then in terms of double bonds pentadecanoic acid has no double bonds so we highlight the zero for no double bonds and then at that space we can see that there's a blue dot blue dots in this case indicate that c c15 is significantly associated with a younger dna methyl age relative to chronological age so this is good news ce15 is significantly associated with a younger epigenetic age based on pheno age and that story is also true for grim age as we can see that ce15 not again not c15 is significantly associated with a younger grim age so from both of these ep epigenetic clocks we can see that the cholesterol eser containing c-15 or pentadecanoic acid is significally associated with a younger ep genetic age again to highlight not the fatty acid on its own but when that fatty acid is bound to the cholesterol cholesterol eser that is significally associated with a younger epigenetic age based on pheno age and grim age now the good news is that c15 can be tracked which means it can be potentially optimized so with that in mind i've been using ad home metabolomics using io's kit which includes c15 but also 600 other 600 plus other metabolites many of which i've covered on the channel and if you've missed any of those videos i'll link to it in the right corner if you want to measure c15 or any of those metabolites on your own there's a discount link in the video's description all right so what's my data that's what we'll see here these are levels of the c again cholesterol esther containing the pentadecanoic acid c-15 from 2023 to 2024 as i have 11 tests over that span so in 2023 over five tests average ce5 was 7. 7.7 micromolar which then raises the question what's optimal now when considering that relatively higher levels of these c15 are associated with a younger epigenetic age at worst i want to avoid an age related decline now how high it should be i don't know and if anybody's come across papers where c15 is associated with how it's associated with aging or all cause mortality risk please post it in the comments as i've yet to see that data being published all right so 2024 data how well have i resisted an age related change within that relatively short time time span so over six tests average ce 15 is 6.8 micromolar which is definitely going in the wrong direction but the good news at least based on a two sample t test is that these two groups of data 2023 versus 2024 are not significally different as the p value is greater than 0.05 nonetheless the goal is not to it have it go in the wrong direction and experience any age related a decline so at worst i want to keep it at least stable or increase slightly if i can so the next test test number 13 i'm waiting on results for test number 12 which was sent on september 6th test number 13 uh just happened a few days ago so those results take about a month to come in so expect an update on this story at some point probably in december all right that's all for now if

while also helping to support the channel including atome metabolomics ulta lab test which is where i get the majority of my non- metabolomic and epigenetic tests done epigenetic testing ned quantification oral microbiome composition at home blood tossing with sciox health which includes apo but also grim mage as shown in the video green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also o got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
