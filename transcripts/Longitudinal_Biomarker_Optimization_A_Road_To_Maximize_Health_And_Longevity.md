# Longitudinal Biomarker Optimization: A Road To Maximize Health And Longevity?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Will longitudinal biomarker optimization improve health and extend lifespan so with that in mind let's start off today's video with biological clocks and more specifically there are a few generations of biological clocks first and second generation biological clocks were derived from cross-sectional data with the goal of predicting chronological age and or all-cause mortality risk acm risk now some examples of that include the blood biomarker-based pheno age and aging.ai which i regularly present on this channel but also epigenetic tests including horvath hannum dna m or or phenoage the epigenetic test that corresponds to phenoage and grim age now third generation biological clocks may be better and that's because they're derived from longitudinal data and as far as i know there's only one uh clock one longitudinal base clock or third generation clock that it currently exists and that's dunedin pace which is an epigenetic test that measures the pace of epigenetic aging that was derived from the dunedin study which was a longitudinal study or in other words it was the it was derived based on measurements in the same people many times many tests over time rather than cross-sectional data but note that there aren't any yet third generation biological clocks for blood-based biomarkers so we can easily assess that by evaluating our own biomarker changes or their stability over time and then comparing that to published values and by doing that i expect that we can help address that question will longitude or biomarker optimization improve health and extend lifespan by optimizing our own biomarkers over time so in in today's video i'm going to focus on three biomarkers and by no means is this a comprehensive overview by just looking at three biomarkers there are many biomarkers of many organ systems that i intend on covering by looking at longitudinal data so just as a brief intro glucose is a measure of metabolic health and or function albumin is a measure of hepatic or liver health and or function and the rdw or red blood cell distribution with is a subdivision of erythrocytes or red blood cells which would qualify them as an immune related marker so let's jump into the data so glucose increases during aging so that's what we're looking at here mean levels of fasting glucose or average levels of fasting glucose on the y-axis plotted against age on the x and this is over the 18 to 88 year old range and this is in a very large study of 12.5 million people so in terms of that age-related increase for glucose we can see that in youth values around 85 milligrams per deciliter for men in green and women in red that then increase to greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter in 88 year olds so from that same study lowest all-cause mortality risk was identified as 80 to 94 milligrams per deciliter so then we can then define our longitudinal glucose goals which would be to avoid the age-related increase and then consistently stay within that 80 to 94 milligram per deciliter range now note that the reference range at least based on the quest on quest lab is 65 to 99 milligrams per deciliter so if we only focused on the reference rate range we may miss these longitudinal trends so with that in mind what's my data so i have glucose data that goes all the way back to 2006 so this is 17 years of data and more specifically the little n is how many blood tests did i have over that time period so i have 45 venipuncture blood tests this is not fingerprint since 2006. And we can see that there is a positive correlation with the correlation coefficient of 0.26 but it's just outside of statistical significance with a p-value of 0.09 so one reason why glucose isn't significantly correlated with age in my data although that trend line is definitely increasing is because of improvements in 2022 which are further illustrated here so on the top of the columns we've got year or group of years number of tests in the middle and then the average glucose over those tests for a given time period in the far right column and we can see that indeed my glucose levels did increase from the 80s into the 90s as highlighted in red for the glucose levels in the 90s but then in 2022 i've been able to somewhat reverse that with an average glucose level of 89 milligrams to deciliter over six tests so another way to look at this data is that my average glucose level over these 45 tests is 89.6 so if we plot that on the graph we can see that that's the expected value for someone around 30 years old in contrast for someone of my current chronological age or over the chronological age period that all of these blood tests were accrued with the red arrow a blood glucose level of closer to 100 would be expected so an argument can be made that my current or my average glucose levels over the past 17 years are about 20 years younger than expected based on chronological age so in terms of the longitudinal glucose goals in terms of avoiding the age-related increase uh with the if if i didn't have 2022 data that would be an x but because of 2022 i've given that a check what about consistently staying within the 80 to 94 milligram per deciliter range so for that we put up the range bars uh on the graph there 80 to 94 and we can see that most of the data most of the dots which are each uh correspond to an individual blood test we can see that most of them are within that range more specifically 37 of the 45 blood tests are within the 80 to 94 range or 82 percent of all tests are within the lowest all-cause mortality risk range so i've given that a check so this is just one biomarker example and then i think that by using this approach for multiple multiple biomarkers for as many organ systems as possible this can help assess one systemic rate of aging or potentially slow it down thereby either improving health and or lifespan so albumin declines during aging biomarker number two in this analysis so we've got serum levels of albumin on the y-axis plotted against age and the age range for this study went from birth all the way up to centenarian status or 100 years old and note that this is in also a very large study of about 1.1 million people albumin levels peak in youth with values for women around 45 with and for men about 46 grams per liter after which they decline during aging as shown there such that centenarians have values approaching 36 grams per liter now the reference range and again using quests reference range is 36 to 51 grams per liter so if we only focused on the reference range we would miss the age-related decline for albumin as centenarians would be within range and the youthful levels would be in range so we would miss the age-related decline by only focusing on the reference range now in a different study and i linked to this study and all the other studies in this video in the video's description so if you're interested in that check it out but lowest all-cause mortality risk in a relatively large study of a few hundred thousand people for for albumin with all-cause mortality risk was in the 45 to 48 grams per liter range so with those data the aging and all-cause mortality data we can define our longitudinal albumin goals which are to avoid the age-related decline and consistently stay within the 45 to 48 grams per liter range so what's my data so for abimin i have data that goes back to 2005 so i have 46 blood tests over that 18-year period and here we can see a significant increase for album with a correlation coefficient of 0.3 and you can see that that p-value is less than 0.05 so it's a significant increase uh increase in correlation in other words over time i've been able to increase my albumin levels so in terms of the longitudinal albumin goals we can see that i've resisted the age-related decrease for albumin and instead i have a significant increase but that may not necessarily be good so in terms of the longitudinal album and goals the other one is to consistently stay within that 45 to 48 grams per liter range which is associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk so how well have i done for that so so we put the range on the chart and we can see that not all of the dots are within that 45 to 48 gram per liter range and i should say the units on my chart are are in grams per deciliter so we just divide grams per liter by 10 to get the same data more specifically in terms of falling within the 45 to 48 grams per liter range eight only 18 of the 40 my 46 blood tests since 2005 have been within their range or 39 so for that i've given that an x so i've got a lot of room to improve to consistently stay within the 45 to 48 range for albumin now that's important because albumin greater than 49 grams per liter or 4.9 grams per deciliter is associated with an increased all-cause mortalities from that same study the lynn 2020 paper if if there is good news my last two tests i've been doing a better job of keeping albumin within that range i've had abdomen levels of 4.6 and 4.8 grams per per deciliter so uh next up we've got the rdw so the red blood cell distribution with is shown here plotted on the y-axis against age and this in this case we've got uh younger than 50 years grouped into one category at the far left all the way up past 100 years so we've got centenarians in this study of about 4 700 people and if anybody's come across the largest larger studies for how the red blood cell distribution with changes during aging please leave it in the comments because this is the largest study that i was able to find so the rdw percent increases during aging as shown for men in blue and women in red and you can see that correlation coefficient of 0.32 and the p-value is very low 1 times 10 to the negative 253. The reference range for quest using quest lab is 11 to 15 so again if we only focus on the reference range we would miss that age-related or mostly miss the age-related increase for for the rdw and we can see that here by using the 15 as a cutoff only one age group the male centenarians have a median rdw that would be higher than the reference range although there are some older groups that have some overlap the median values are only past 15 for that for the centenary men as shown on this plot for everybody else it's the median values were lower than 15 percent now in terms of lowest all-cause mortality risk in a study of more more than three million people that was shown to be uh with an rdw of less than 12.5 percent so with the aging and all-cause mortality data we can define our longitudinal rdw goals which would be to avoid the age-related increase and consistently keep rdw percent less than 12.5 so how well have i done with that what's my data so here we've got the rdw plotted against age and i've got rdw data that goes back to 2003 so this is 20 years of data with 43 blood tests over that time span and here we can see a non-significant uh inverse correlation for the rdw versus age in other words in my data the rdw percent is not significantly correlated with age so in terms of our longitudinal rdw goals we can see that i've i've avoided the age-related increase as rdw has not increased over time in my data all right what about consistently keeping the rdw percent less than 12.5 so for that we go to 12.5 is the cutoff and we can see just visually we can see that about half the dots seem to be above the line and about half seem to be below that more specifically 24 were below it and 43 of 24 of the 43 blood tests were below 12.5 or 56 so i do have some room for improvement there now the good news is that for all six tests so far in 2022 my rdw percent has been less than 12.5 and my average rdw over that over those six tests is 12 so i'm on the right track with my current diet in terms of keeping my rdw relatively low now if there's a weakness in this approach it's that i've used cross-sectional aging and all-cause mortality data in this study or in this video but note that the longitudinal and cross-sectional data largely agree but the cross-sectional studies that i've shown in this video have far larger sample sizes in other words longitudinal studies may have a few thousand people with repeated measures over time but which would be the stronger way to present the data is it with the study of 12.5 million people cross-sectionally or with a study of 2 000 people that has only a few data points per person over over a 20-year span so i've decided in this video to show the cross-sectional data just by sheer number of sample size being greater than what's found in the longitudinal studies so this is just a part one of this series as i've only gone over three biomarkers i'll cover more biomarkers using the longitudinal goals in future videos so if you're interested in that stay tuned for part two and even maybe parts three through seven and beyond all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got some discount links that you may be interested in epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you would just like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all these links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
