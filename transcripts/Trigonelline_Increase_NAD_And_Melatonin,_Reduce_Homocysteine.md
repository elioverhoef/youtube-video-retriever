# Trigonelline: Increase NAD And Melatonin, Reduce Homocysteine?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

During aging nad degradation can be linked to increased homocystine and decreased methionine so let's check out those pathways so first starting with nad an age related increase for cd38 will degrade nad into nicotinamide and note that i'm just using cd38 as an example there are many ways to degrade ned during aging so an increase in nicotinamide will then be converted into nicotinic acid thereby increasing nicotinic acid levels and this is via later's principle which shows that an increase in reactants in this case nicotinamide will shift the reaction to the right thereby leading to an increase in products in this case nicenic acid an increase in nicenic acid will then combine with s adenos methionine otherwise known as sam and converting it into trigonelline which is just a fancy way of saying methylated nicotinic acid as you can see there nicotinic acid now has a methyl group attached now that methyl group came from acenil methionine which now converts that into s adenos homosysteine or sah the importance of that increase for s adenos homosysteine nicotinic acid is converted into trigonelline is that higher levels of siden homosysteine will lead to higher levels of homosysteine and that's what we'll see here so sah is right there and again by later's principle an increase in reactants in this case saah will lead to an increase in the product in this case homocysteine so we can see how n degradation is linked with an increase for homocysteine now also during the conversion of nicotinic acid into trigonelline we have the depletion of s acenil methine and that's important because lower levels of sam will lead to lower levels of melatonin and we can see that reaction here so under normal situations sosal methionine combines with five netl 5 hydroxy tryptamine otherwise known as n acetal serotonin and together they combine to form melatonin so we can see how nad degradation links with an increase for homocysteine and al also a decrease for melatonin potentially linking deficits in any energy production i.e nad low levels of nad during aging with an increase for homocysteine which links with vascular health and dementia risk and also lower levels of melatonin which could affect sleep quality and or duration things that are very important during aging so with that in mind if we specifically increased trigonelline can we increase nad and melatonin while reducing homosysteine so why would i think that that's possible so if we increase trigonelline again by later's principle that should shift the reaction to the uh products which in this case would be nicotinic acid while consuming acenil homocystine and producing acenil methionine more on those in a minute an increase in nicotinic acid will then be converted into nicotinamide and and then the increase in nicotinamide will then be converted into nad again by lat's principle in each situation so that's possible that an increase in trigonelline would lead to an increase in nad now also during this process it by converting trigonelline into nicotinic acid as i mentioned identical homosysteine is consumed so with that being lower we should expect homosysteine to also be lower so trigonelline increasing trigonelline may also lead to a reduction for homos and then in the conversion of trigonelline into nicotinic acid we saw that aenos methionine levels would be increased as that methyl group would be transferred from uh trigonelline to acenil homocysteine thereby forming acenil methine so now we would have an increase for sam and when sam is increased we should get that uh leftward shift from reactants to products thereby increasing melatonin so will that work and to first address that we need to know which foods contain trigonelline now there are some supplements that contain relatively low levels of trigonelline i prefer to get it from whole foods first if others want to go the supplement direction that's on them but for me i prefer to get it from foods first so with that in mind which foods contain trigonelline and that's what we can see here a top the list is coffee with 2200 micrograms of trigonelline per gram now i'm not much of a coffee drinker and i can get into that into the comments it's a side uh tangent um and there aren't any major reasons uh other than i prefer tea and i'm already super hydrated i can't add that in too so nonetheless second on the list chickpeas and i often get asked on the on the on the channel you know why don't i include legumes in my diet and that's also a side uh answer it's a tangent to what the video is about but if anyone's curious about why uh legumes aren't a major part of the diet or hadn't been i can i can fully detail that in the comments so chickpeas have 350 microgram of trigonelline per gram of chickpeas second on the list so with that in mind i've added chickpeas back into the diet i did include them for a few blood tests uh a couple years ago but they didn't move biomarkers at all so i took them out so i've reintroduced them or i reintroduced them a couple of days ago which then opens a few more questions first will eating chickpeas increase trigonelline and we can measure trion trigonelline levels plasma levels this is using iolo's atome metabol tabics kit i now have four data points four plasma levels of trigonelline as shown there and note that they're on the low side 29 .154 and .11 micromolar interestingly for my highest level at 04 that coincided with when i was supplementing with 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day which shouldn't be a surprise because again later's principle the reactant in this case would be nicotinic acid some of that would be converted into trigonelline which it looks like it may have done again i can't imply causation though it's just one test i would need a lot more data to show that that was causitive or not it could just be normal test to test variation if you're interested in measuring trigonelline and 600 other metabolites that are included on this test there's a discount link in the video description all right so second if i'm going to include chickpeas in the diet something's got toa come out in order to stay calorie neutral so what will i reduce two possible options are barley notes which in pulling up a second study and note that all the studies in the video will be in the video's description we can see that barley has very low levels of trigonelline and i should mention if i didn't already that barley notes are already a part of my diet these are two areas where i could remove to add uh chickpeas so barley has very low levels of trigonelline just 0.25 micrograms per gram of barley when compared with oats in this study which had about 112 micrograms per gram in other words about a 400 times higher dose of trigonelline in oats in this study when compared with barley and also in confirmation that oats have a decent amount of trigonelline we can see in the study above that they had 230 micrograms per gram still not as high as chickpeas though so i can see the argument for uh reducing or eliminating oats and barley for the next test and completely replacing them with chickpeas which i may do until the next test so then third the question is will it work and to address that for the next blood test test which will be uh january 15th in 2023 in addition to the standard chem panel and cbc that i do for every test i'll also send blood for ned homocysteine and metabolomics including trigonelline now includ in terms of melatonin uh i'm i can't wake up in the middle of the night and draw blood and even spitting in the middle of the night to do a saliva sample for melatonin may not be the best bet either as that may impair my sleep quality for when i'm doing that experiment so subjectively i'll have uh you know measure measures of was i sleeping better or not and i'll have the objective data of sleep duration as the fitness tracker tracks that so stay tuned for all that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including at home metabolomics which measures trigonelline and as i mentioned 600 other metabolites nad quantification epigenetic and tmia testing or microbiome composition ition at home blood testing with sciox health with which includes apob die tracking green tea or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand which is what i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
