Relatively higher triglycerides are associated with an increased coronary heart disease mortality risk and that's what we can see here in this study of about 4.5 million people on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio for chd mortality in other words risk of death from heart disease plotted against triglycerides or tag on the x-axis and when looking at the fully adjusted model that's the data in green and the shaded green region we can see that above a triglyceride level of about 75 mig per leader that chd mortality risk significantly increases as its shaded green shaded green region is completely above that hazard ratio of one so these data would suggest that triglycerides are bad for health but all triglycerides are not the same for the potential impacts on health and even longevity and that's because individual triglycerides are associated with an increased odds of living to 85 years and that's what we'll see here this is a study that looked at a plot of longevity versus all cause mortality in about 12,000 people on the waxes we've got the log of the odds ratio o r for longevity in other words odds of living to 85 years plotted against the log of the hazard ratio for all cause mortality in other words risk of death for all causes on the x-axis and where we want to be on this plot is the upper left quadrant and that's where there's the highest odds for reaching 85 years and the lowest risk for death from all causes um all cause mortality risk so there we can see that there are three at least three triglyceride species that pop up in that upper left quadrant c568 in other words 56 carbons eight double bonds triglyceride tag uh 58 carbons 11 double bonds and 58 carbons seven double bonds as shown there and there are a few other red dots that are not shown which are shown here so there are four other triger species and then we can see how they relate to that odds of reaching 85 years in this table so those five tride species and that's what's shown on the left odds of reaching 85 years in the middle now here we can see that the odds ratio is greater than one in each case for example for the c549 tag it's 1.11 but more importantly is the data in parenthesis that's the 95% confidence interval and you can see that that those values are completely above one which suggests a significant association and when looking at the p value in fdr for each of these five long longevity associated triglycerides we can see that their their uh p value in fdr is less than 0.05 so these are significantly associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years so with that in mind the goal is to keep these triglycerides relatively high and the good news is that these triglycerides can be tracked and then potentially optimized and the way i've been doing that is i've used i'm using uh iola's atome metabolomics kit which includes 241 different triglyceride species including 29 longevity associ associated triglycerides that correspond to the five that are on this table in addition this kit also has data for 385 and more metabolites which i've highlighted in many videos on this channel and if you're interested in using it yourself discount link in the video's description all right so what's my data so all of that data for seven tests is shown here on the right we've got those five longevity associated trius rides and then note that on the left there are a myriad of ways to form these triglycerides in the first case c549 there's only one uh metabolite in iolo's kit that correspond so that's relatively easy but when going to 566 you can see that there are a variety of different triglyceride combinations that form the 566 triglyceride species for example c224 in one case c24 in another case and then you've got two other groups of fatty acids 342 and 36 to so there are many different triglyceride combinations that can form a given triglyceride species in this case 566 and we can see why that's the case by taking a quick look at triglyceride biochemistry as shown here so on the left triglyceride is has a glycerol backbone and then there are three fatty acids that are uh connected aerified to glycerol in this case each of the fatty acids are the same uh and they include the c12 one double bond fatty acid so to to get the sum we get a c363 triglyceride as shown there so each of these each of these positions in the triglyceride can have different fatty acids thereby leading to different combinations and uh with these combinations forming specific triglyceride species all right so how am i tracking these data with the goal of keeping them relatively high well i tested five times in 2023 and then for each test i'm taking the sum of these 29 longevity associated triglycerides that correspond to these five triglyceride species so for the first test for example we can see that that sum was 17.5 micromolar now that's relatively low and actually that's the lowest value that i had for their sum for any of the five tests in 2023 in contrast for test number three i had 79 micromolar which is my best to date for these 29 triglyceride uh species so the goal is to keep these relatively high now another way that i'm looking at it is by looking at year-to-year changes with the goal of avoiding any age related decrease or even a diet induced change that can lead to a decrease in these specific tri triglycerides so for 2022 when looking at the sum for those five different tests my average value for these 29 triglyceride species is 42 micromolar now for 2024 i currently have data for two tests i just sent uh data on monday corresponding to blood test number three in 2024 for analysis to iolo so that'll be test number three so after the first two tests though the average uh value for these 29 triglycerides is currently 47 micromolar so 2024 is off to a really good relatively good start and avoiding any age related decline and keeping these triglycerides these specific triglycerides relatively high so then the question is how can i keep these triglycerides relatively high and for that i calculate correlations with diet and i won't go into it in this video but they are currently on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out we've also got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition ned quantification at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob b but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
