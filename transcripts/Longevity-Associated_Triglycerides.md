Relatively higher levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got all cause mortality risk plotted against circulating levels of triglycerides on the x and this study was a metaanalysis of 14 studies that included more than 330,000 people with an average age of 48 years at the baseline visit in this study once triglycerides went above 1.69 millar or 150 mig per deciliter all cause mortality risk significantly increased all right so what about older than 48 years and that's what we'll see in this study which included more than 1.5 million people with an average age of 57 years at the baseline visit on the x-axis we've got hazard ratio or all cause mortality risk plotted against circulating levels of triglycerides on the y and then when looking at less than 1.7 millar again or less than 150 mig per deciliter which was the defined as the referent all values above that were significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and we know we know that that's significant that each of these quintiles is significantly associated with all cause mortality risk because the 95% confidence interval or 95% ci the data in parentheses are completely above one for each of these quintiles all right so what about older than 57 years so this isn't a plot of all cause mortality risk but it is uh the hazard ratio for uh coronary heart disease mortality so heart disease mortality risk plotted against circulating levels of triglycerides in milligrams per deciliter on the x and in this study which included almost 4.5 million people and note that all of these studies will be in the videoos description so if you're interested in that check it out in this study once triglycerides got above 80 milligrams per deciliter and looking at the fully adjusted model the data in green model 3 once i got above 80 mig per deciliter we can see that there there was a significantly increased uh coronary heart disease mortality risk so from these three studies we can see that relatively higher triglycerides are associated with an increased coronary heart disease and all cause mortality risk but note that triglycerides are not a homogenous metabolite group when we think about triglycerides we think of them as basically one big large group and they're all going in the wrong direction if they're increasing but individual triglycerides are associated with an increased odds of living to 85 years and that's what we'll see here in this plot it's of longevity against all cause mortality risk on the y- axis we've got the odds o being the odds ratio or probability of longevity which in this study was defined as reaching 85 years and on the x-axis we've got the hazard ratio hr for all cause mortality or all cause mortality risk so where we want to be on this plot is in the upper left quadrant as that would be associated with an increased probability of reaching 85 5 years and a relatively low risk for all cause mortality so when looking at the metabolites in that quadrant uper upper left we can see the amino acid serene is there and that's a story for another day i'll probably talk about that in a in an upcoming homosysteine video but note that we've got at least one triglyceride as shown there c56 colon 8 tag so that is a triglyceride tag with 56 carbons and eight double bonds now just to introduce what that even means structurally this is just the generic structure of a triglyceride uh metabolite which includes three fatty acids triglyceride being three bound to the glycerol backbone as shown there now these three fatty acids are all the same in this case and they each have a double bind as indicated by that slanted uh line so this would be the uh c12 colon one because each of these fatty acids has 12 carbons and one double bond on and to get how many uh fatty acids the sum of these fatty acids c121 multipli by three since they're all the same yields a c363 triglyceride so that's just an example that metabolite that triglyceride metabolite is not one that's found in the upper left quadrant but i just wanted to illustrate what triglyceride structure actually means because we'll see a whole bunch of different triglyceride species coming up in a minute so it's not just the c568 triglyceride that's associated with an increased probability of reaching 85 years we can see in this plot that there are two others and not included but they are amongst those red dots that are in that upper left quadrant are four others c549 and then c-56 with six seven or nine double bonds so from this from these data we can see that there are indeed longevity associated triglycerides and i just want to uh reiterate the point i'm not saying that we should have high levels of triglycerides but based on this data it would suggest that having certain triglyceride species being relatively high while keeping total levels of triglycerides relatively low may be a good strategy for reaching at least 85 years and along those lines five of these triglycerides that are associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years can be tracked which means they can be potentially optimized and i've been doing that using iolo's atome metabolomics kit if you're familiar with the channel you've seemen me make a whole bunch of videos using this kit and beyond these uh metabolites it includes more 600 including 241 triglyceride species and amongst those 29 are linked with increased odds of reaching 85 years if you're interested in using the kit discount link in the video's description so in terms of those triglycerides that are associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years we can see those five that i just mentioned in the earlier slide here c549 and again c-56 which has six seven eight or nine double bonds and we can see that each of these is is significantly associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years as their 95% confidence confidence interval again the data in parentheses is completely above one for each of these five metabolites in additionally the p value and fdr or false discovery rate or each less than 0.05 which highlights their statistically significant but it's not just these five metabolites as i mentioned there are 29 longevity or an increased odds are reaching 85 years uh so how do we go for five metabolites to 29 so that's what we'll go through here so the first one's pretty easy the c549 and note that i had to put an underscore for the uh c549 because if i enter it as a colon excel reads that as as the date so i had to put it as an underscore but for the c549 triglyceride that's easy because there's just one metabolite in iolo's kit but for c- 566 we can see that there are eight metabolites that that fall under that metabolite grouping 4 c56 6 so let's illustrate how that that's possible so for the first we can see that the triglyceride 224 that's 22 carbons and four double bonds so that's a polyunsaturated fatty acid bound to the glycerol backbone in conjunction with two other fatty acids that have a combined 34 carbons and two double bonds moving forward we can see that all of those eight species are not the same including the one at the bottom of the list which has at one position the c160 which is a fatty acid that has 16 carbons and no double bond so it's a saturated fatty acid and then at the other two positions it has the sum of 40 carbons and six double bonds so in other words these are many different triglyceride species that fall under the 566 triglyceride uh umbrella so we can add them together to form the 566 as one metabolite more on that in a minute so we can see that 567 has a bunch of metabolites that fall under that window see 568 and then a few for c569 which then brings us to what's optimal so so when considering that these triglycerides are significally associated with an increased probability of reaching 85 years i think it makes sense to keep these specific triglycerides relatively high if we can and again while keeping all triglycerides as a net sum beyond these five the whole net sum of triger is relatively low easier said than than done i know but we'll see how this story plays out in future tests so i currently have four tests using io's kit i'm going to send test number five tomorrow and for for test number three i did a pretty good job of keeping these tres relatively high but for test number one i didn't do a very good job now i haven't started calculating correlations with diet yet but once i get to five or six tests i'll start to look at correlations for diet with these quote unquote longevity associated triglycerides and we'll see if maybe i can use diet to keep them relatively high with overall triglycerides relatively low all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics iolo's kit epigenetic and tm testing oral microbiome composition nad quantification at home blood testing which includes apob green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or di tri brand which i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
