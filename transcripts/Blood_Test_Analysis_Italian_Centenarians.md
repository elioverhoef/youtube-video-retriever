By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

What does the biochemistry of longevity look like in an earlier video we took a look at blood test data from the henon centenarian study which included more than 1700 people that had a median age of 100 years old so in that video we identified what was good in terms of biomarkers that were youthful and were associated with a low all-cause mortality risk and correspondingly biomarkers that were bad but what about the biochemistry of longevity in other geographical regions so with that in mind in today's video we're going to take a look at blood test data from uh four italian centenarians and that's what we can see here so first uh identifying some terms so in this study there were 120 quote unquote healthy centenarians and i'll explain that more in a minute uh so in terms of centenarians this was uh heavily weighted towards uh more women than than men 100 women and only 20 men and this is pretty common in centenarian studies as far more women reach 100 years old than men so in terms of healthy centenarians what did what was that defined as so these were centenarians that were free of acute or chronic illness and more specifically they didn't have alzheimer's disease metabolic diseases cardiovascular disease stroke cancer or any infectious disease active infection all right so what about the data so in this video we're going to identify what was good what was leaning towards not good and what was just outright not good or even bad and note that there's going to be a lot of data in this video so there'll be timestamps in the video's description for each biomarker so if you don't want to go through the whole video you can just go through the video's description and click on each individual biomarker for the ones that you may be interested in all right starting off from the top let's take a look at what was good uh in terms and first on the list is glucose so how let's put this data into into perspective with aging related changes and all cause mortality risk so first it should be pretty clear to everyone glucose increases during aging with values in the mid 80s in youth that increase to more than 100 in both men and green and women in red as shown there and this is data from a study that included about 12.5 million people so putting the centenarian uh blood test of blood glucose level of 84 into perspective this would be a very youthful value so what about all-cause mortality risk so there's a similar story here and using data from the same study we can see all-cause mortality risk there and it's a j-shaped curve which means that lowest risk for all-cause mortality was in the 80 to 94 milligram per deciliter range and then all-cause mortality risk increases for glucose levels below 80 and also higher than 95. So when we put the centenarian 84 into perspective we can see it's right at the bottom of that curve so lowest all-cause mortality risk based on their the centenarian glucose data so in terms of what's good uh these centenarians have youthful and healthy levels of glucose so next up is hdl and so let's put this data into perspective how does hdl change during aging and we can see that data here so hdl peaks and youth with values of around 56 for men and around 65 for women in around in the 20s early 20s and then the hdl declines pretty steadily during aging for women such that 88 year olds the high end of the age range in this study have values in the 50s now for men the decline for hdl is more steep into the 30s after which it stabilizes in the low 50s for the duration of the lifespan or at least until 88 in this study so when putting the centenary and data of 57 milligrams per deciliter into perspective for women this would be what you would expect to see an average value what you'd expect to see for someone approaching 60 and for men this is higher than the peak of around 56 in youth so from this we can conclude that hdl for these centenarians is youthful so what about all-cause mortality risk and we can see that data here and again this is uh from a study of 15.9 million million people and all of these studies will be in the also in the video's description so i'm looking at all-cause mortality risk and putting the centenary and 57 milligrams per deciliter into this chart we can see that it's right at the bottom of uh mortality risk so it's at the lowest all-cause mortality risk so in terms of what's good we can see that these centenarians have both youthful and healthy levels of hdl all right next up are triglycerides so starting with all-cause mortality data and this is a meta-analysis of 61 studies uh lowest all-cause mortality risk for triglycerides is around 90 milligrams per deciliter or one millimolar now when you go higher than one millimolar though as shown by the red arrow all-cause mortality risk increases as triglycerides increase up to 3.5 millimolar in this study so around that would be around 300 milligrams per deciliter so putting the centenarian uh 106 milligrams per deciliter into perspective we can see that it's relatively close to the lowest all-cause mortality risk it's not at the lowest risk 90 milligrams per deciliter or one millimolar but it's not too far away from it so in terms of what's good these centenarians have relatively healthy levels of triglycerides at least in terms of all-cause mortality risk but we can put this data into perspective in a different way so relatively low triglycerides may also be a hallmark of longevity and this is data from 13 separate studies that looked at triglyceride levels in people that were a hundred years old or older as shown here and as you can see by their triglyceride levels in 11 of these 13 studies triglycerides were less than 110 milligrams per deciliter or around 1.2 millimolar so that's why based on this data relatively low triglycerides may be a hallmark of longevity all right next up are red blood cells so red blood cells decline during aging as shown here with values of about 4.8 in men green line and around 4.3 for women in youth that then that then declined to about 3.9 in uh 95 year olds so putting the centenarian data of 4.24 uh onto this plot we can see that these red blood cells are about 30 to 80 years younger than expected based on a hundred year old chronological age so the centenarians are off to a good start in terms of having relatively youthful red blood cell levels now hemoglobin is found within red blood cells so let's take a look at that data and looking at all-cause mortality data first starting with men so in this study the referent was defined as 14 to 14.9 in terms of the centenarian data they had 12.53 grams per deciliter and as you can see that men that had hemoglobin levels that were less than 13 in this study that was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so any of the men in the italian centenarian study that had hemoglobin levels of 12.53 would have an increased all-cause mortality risk all right what about data for women and note that again this italian centenarian study was predominantly women uh five out of every six people were our centenarians were women in this study so when com compared with the reference in this case which was 12 to 12.9 increased all-cause mortality risk for women was only present when uh hemoglobin was less than 11. So in this situation the hemoglobin levels in in the italian centenarian study were 12.53 which would put these women at lowest all-cause mortality risk so in terms of what's good these centenarians have relatively youthful and healthy levels of hemoglobin for women and youthful red blood cells but unhealthy hemoglobin levels for men with an increased all-cause mortality risk all right next up are platelets so play this plateless decline during aging for both men and women and so going from the age range from 20 all the way up to 100 for both men and women in this study we can see that platelet levels start off at about 230 in men and declined to less than 210 as they get close to about 100 years old similarly for women platelet levels start off a little higher around 260 that then decline to 240 as these women uh in this study approached 100 years old so when considering that the platelets in the italian centenarian study were 212 that would be about 20 years younger than expected for the men but even older than expected for the women so what about all-cause mortality risk that can help to add perspective to the age-related data and in this study of about 130 000 people when looking at all-cause mortality uh 200 to 300 platelets was defined as the referent as shown there with the relative risk of one but then platelet levels that were less than 200 and that were greater than 300 had a significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality so from this we can conclude that 200 to 300 platelets is associated with maxillary reduced all-cause mortality risk so in terms of what's good although these centenarians have aged relatively age levels of platelets these are healthy levels as it's associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk all right next up is uric acid so how does uric acid change during aging and note that there are very few studies on uh how uric acid changes during aging and if anyone's come across larger studies i'm going to show data from uh that included about 80 000 people if anyone's come across larger studies than that please post it in the comments so starting with the data from men uh this is about fifty thousand men uh first they looked at men at for uh each individual age group so twenty year olds uh thirty year olds forty year olds all the way up to sixty year olds and then these people came back and provided subsequent blood tests so it was evaluated longitudinally and when evaluated longitudinally uric acid levels increase for each respective age group as shown there for the men but note that uric acid ua was higher cross-sectionally and young when compared with old so we can see that the young people in this study had uric acid levels of about uh 355 whereas the 60 year olds had values that were lower of around 340. And if we would put the centenarian uric acid levels onto this plot this would be even further uh reduced uh with a value of 333 micromolar so from this we can conclude that for at least for men in this study uric acid levels were indicative of aged so what about the women now this is data from the same study about 30 000 women and it's a little bit more uh consistent and clear so after 40 years old we can see that regardless of the age birth cohort or the age when uric acid levels were evaluated whether in 20 year olds or 60 year olds we can see that uric acid levels consistently increase during aging for women so if we're going to plot the uric acid levels for women on this plot we would see that it would be even higher than the top which was 300 micromolar so again from this we can conclude that uric acid levels in the italian centenarians was aged or indicative of age levels all right what about all-cause mortality risk so that's we're looking at here all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of uric acid on the x now lowest all-cause mortality risk as shown there at the bottom of the curve was present at a concentration of 303 micromolar and note that the centenarians the italian centenarians had an average value of 333 micromolar which is very close to lowest all-cause mortality risk so that's good news so in terms of what's good although these centenarians had aged levels of uric acid not youthful they had close to the lowest all-cause mortality risk based on their uric acid levels all right so now we're going to start to get into some uh data that trends towards not good and get starts to look down outright bad all right so first ast uh this is it mostly liver enzyme let's put that data into perspective by looking at all-cause mortality data and in this study it was a 16.6 million people so uh first when um looking at the referent which was uh ast with a median value of 20 the centenary the italian centenarian value of 23.3 will put them into q3 which had a 5 significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk so ast is actually good news in this situation all right so what about alt this is also a mostly liver enzyme marker so what does the data for ast look like in terms of all cause mortality risk so using data from that same study in this case the referent was defined as uh or was defined had a median value sorry of 15 and this is where we would find our italian centenarians as their average value was 13.4 but notice there's a red rectangle there and that's because although the reference in most studies is usually lowest risk for all-cause mortality in this study actually q3 q2 and q3 so relatively higher alt in this case 18 to 22 was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk so in this situation the alt of 13.4 for the italian centenarians would actually be higher all-cause mortality risk when compared with values in the 18 to 22 range so we've got one liver marker that's good ast and one liver marker that may be not good or sub-optimal alt so to break the tie or to add more insight looking at the ratio between these two the ast to alt ratio with all-cause mortality risk may provide more insight and that's what we can see here so uh this is we're looking at survival on the y-axis so all-cause mortality and then this is up to about a 10-year follow-up after the baseline assessment of the ast to alt ratio so and again it's all caused mortality or all-cause death as shown there so in people that had a relatively low ast to alt ratio in this case their ratio was about 1.02 and when a relatively high ast to alt ratio in this case was an average ratio of 1.83 when looking at survival or again up to about 10 year 10 years after the initial assessment we can see that people that had a relatively lower asd alt ratio had improved survival as shown by the green line when compared with the red line the that had a higher ast to alt ratio so putting the centenary and data into perspective so dividing ast by alt that yields a ratio of 1.745 which is much closer to being in the high ast to alt ratio range versus the low uh which had a value of 1.02 so in terms of what's good although ast is good and alt is sub-optimal ast to alt that ratio is most definitely trending in the wrong direction all right next up in terms of things that may be trending towards not good was total cholesterol so first let's take a look at how total cholesterol tc changes during aging and that's what we can see here so total cholesterol is relatively low in youth and it's found in youth and then it increases during aging up until around the mid 50s for both men and green and women in red and then it starts to decline afterwards uh up to 88 years on or the maximum age range in this study of 12.8 million people uh 80 so it declines up to around 88 but what what about older than 88 so if we're gonna extrapolate based on how that trend after the mid 50s goes for total cholesterol i don't think it's a far stretch to think that we could see even further reductions for total cholesterol for a hundred year old so in that case low total cholesterol is found in youth but it can also be found potentially in an in advanced age so total clustered age-related data for total cholesterol can't tell us anything about whether it's good or bad for the italian centenarians and their value of 189 milligrams per deciliter all right so what about all-cause mortality risk so this is data from the same study and looking at the 75 to 99 year old age group which is pretty close to centenarian status so when putting the centenary and data the italian centenary data of 189 into perspective that's actually not too far from the lowest all-cause mortality risk of 220 to 229 in this study but note there are some sex specific effects so having a centenarian value in this study of 189 was not significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk for men but a five percent increased all-cause mortality risk for women so in terms of what's good we can't tell if total cholesterol is youthful or aged and although there isn't a an increased all-cause mortality risk for men there is a small but significant increase all-cause mortality for women that would have a total cholesterol value of 189. All right so next up are leukocytes or white blood cells wbcs and this is data from the baltimore longitudinal study on aging so people were assessed at a baseline visit and then provided blood samples uh and their mortality status was evaluated more than 40 years up after the initial baseline assessment so in this study we can look at median survival this is the 50 survival when the time when half the population has died and half is still alive and we can see that the longest life expectancy based on white blood cells in this study was for people that had white blood cells in the 3.5 to 6 range in this case they lived 37 years after the initial baseline assessment now shorter life expectancies were found for people that had white blood cells in the six to ten range and even shorter for people that had greater than 10 for white blood cells but i should note the shortest life expectancy was found for people that had less than 3.5 for their white blood cell counts so if we're going to put the italian centenarian data into perspective that would put them in the six to ten white blood cell range which isn't optimal which isn't in the 3.5 to 6 but note that's how much i mean 6.18 isn't that far from you know being within that you know six range it's it's close so in terms of what's good white blood cells are just outside the optimal range of 3.5 to 6. So this isn't a terrible marker but uh it could be a little bit better also note that how white blood cells change during aging isn't a homogeneous change so white blood cells are comprised of neutrophils primarily neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes neutrophils and lymphocytes increase during aging whereas lymphocytes decline during aging so unfortunately in this study they didn't present that additional data for each of these white blood cell differentials but that would provide more context to how how slash weather 6.18 is good you know or potentially bad for uh longevity all right next up is total protein so uh total protein levels decline or decline during aging that's shown there with values of around 7.4 in both men and women that declined to uh around 6.6 to 6.8 uh depending on if it's men or women as shown by the red arrow so if we put the centenary and italian centenarian data into perspective of 7.11 gram per deciliter this is uh 35 these are values that are 35 to 45 years younger than expected based on chronological age so if we stopped there and only looked at total protein based on aging related changes we would miss the story because this is a superficial analysis and that's because total proteins equal the sum of albumin and globulin so we can take a further look at how albumin levels are and how globulin levels are in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk and then get a better evaluation of whether total protein levels for these centenarians is good intermediate or potentially bad so how to album let's start with the albumin levels as shown there 38.4 grams per liter so how do they change during aging well they decline during aging as shown there uh so we're looking at albumin levels on the y axis plotted against age in this case all the way up to 100 years and we can see that but for both men and women albumin levels declined during aging with a peak in youth of around 46 for men and about 45 for women so putting the italian centenarian data into perspective is shown there 38.4 note that these are centenarians so this is a small you know improvement this is about eight years younger albumin than expected based on their chronological age so it would seem that this is good data but let's have a look at all-cause mortality data for albumin and that's what's shown here so all-cause mortality data for albumin on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of albumin on the x so in this case albumin lowest all-cause mortality risk for albumin is 46 grams per liter as shown there so it's the bottom of the curve and then if we're going to put the centenary centenary and data the italian centenarian data into perspective 38.4 we can see that there's a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on their albumin levels so what about globulin as i mentioned total protein equals albumin plus globulin so since we know protein total protein and albumin we can rearrange this equation to calculate the globulin or the gamma gap concentration when we do that we get a value of 32.7 grams per liter now note that i can't calculate the standard deviation but at least we've got a pretty close to an average value there or what we'd expect the average value to be so let's put the globulin level into perspective and this is all caused mortality data or survival probability on the y-axis plotted against time after the baseline assessment of globulin and this was about a five-year follow-up in a study of 94 year olds which isn't too far from our centenarians in the current in the current study so there are two levels of globulin sorry globulin here we're looking at a blue line which had globulin levels that were less than 3.2 and a red line that had globular levels that were greater than 3.2 so in terms of life expectancy or survival we can see that people that had relatively lower levels of this gamma gap or lower globulins so less than 3.2 had the longest life expectancy and then people that had higher globulin levels or a higher gamma gap more than 3.2 had a shorter significantly shorter life expectancy and if we put the italian centenarian data into perspective on this plot they would be in the on the red line as their globulin levels would be uh 3.27 grams per deciliter so uh so based on that data the sent these centenarians the italian centenaries would have an increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with lower levels of globulin so in terms of what's bad these centenarians have aged and unhealthy levels at least based on all-cause mortality at risk of albumin and unhealthy levels of globulin all right so we've got two more biomarkers first up is creatinine so creatinine levels increase during aging as shown here as you can see by the red line and this age range is from 20 to 90 year olds around 90 year olds so the importance of creatinine is that it's used to estimate kidney function using egfr as the marker of kidney function so when using the creatinine value of 1.29 milligrams per deciliter and a 100 year old age we get an egfr of 37 for men and 49 for women so why is that important that's because egfr as that metric of kidney function declines during aging as shown here so uh youthful levels of egfr or again is that metric of kidney function or around 125 in youth that decline towards 50 in people approaching 100 years old so putting the centenarian uh egfr data uh into into perspective on this plot we'd expect to see it somewhere there around 50 or even less you know at least based on the data from men so in terms of what's bad we've got these centenarians these italian centenarians have aged levels of creatinine and a relatively low or age expected levels of egfr all right so last but not least is urea nitrogen or blood urea nitrogen and these italian centenarians had a level of 52 milligrams per deciliter so let's put that data into perspective so blood urea nitrogen increases during aging and if you're if you're familiar with the channel you've seen this uh this data many times so uh blood urea nitrogen levels are relatively low in youth with values of 11 and 13 in uh women and men respectively as shown there by the green rectangle and then it increases uh to more than 20 milligrams per deciliter in people approaching 100 years so putting the italian centenarian data into perspective it would be way off the chart as the highest blood urinary nitrogen value on this chart is 24 milligrams per deciliter so it would be way off the chart as i've indicated there so what about all-cause mortality risk so that's we're looking at here all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of blood urine and nitrogen on the x so lowest all-cause mortality risk in this study of more than 425 000 people was present when uh bun was 14.7 milligrams per deciliter as you can see it's at the lowest it's at the low low the bottom of that u-shaped curve but then as blood urine nitrogen increases especially during aging you can see that there's that red line it's there's a significant increase for all-cause mortality risk and putting the centenarian data of 52 milligrams per deciliter onto this plot again it would be way off uh the chart as the high end of the chart only goes up to 39 milligrams per deciliter for blood urine nitrogen so in terms of what's bad these centenarians had aged and unhealthy levels of blood urea nitrogen all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us
