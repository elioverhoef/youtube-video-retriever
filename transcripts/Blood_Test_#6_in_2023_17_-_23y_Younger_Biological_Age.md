# Blood Test #6 in 2023: 17 - 23y Younger Biological Age

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed apologies if you've heard that a billion times but that's the central premise of this channel so with that in mind last week i blood tested for the sixth time in 2023 so what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and if you have similar blood test data you can calculate your own pheno age that link will be in the video's description so when entering the data for the nine component biomarkers on this test i get a biological age of 34 years which is 16.7 years younger than my chronological and if you're familiar with the channel you the last test which looked like an outlier this is a nice rebound uh that test that could have been caused by tryptophan mega doing so i took tryptophan out and went back to my normal routine and hence the almost 17-year reduction relative to chronological age now note that the 17 approximately 17year age reduction could be even a little bit better as for the 13th consecutive test quest high sensitivity c reative protein measurement was less than 0.3 mig per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 but it's not higher as that's the limit of their sensitivity for their ability to detect crp now rather than looking at data entered into a spreadsheet if you're interested in screenshots from the lab report all blood test data is included later in the video now note that this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 as i now have 28 blood tests over that period and that's what we can see here so starting in 2018 to 2019 average biological age using this test was 36.1 years and then over 12 tests in 2020 to 2021 average biological age using the lavine test was 35.6 years and then i significantly reduced it in 2022 to 33.8 years and and note that i've documented each of these data points with videos on the channel just check out the tracking biological age playlists and you'll find these videos older videos all right so what about in 2023 thus far average pheno age is 34.6 years and that includes the most recent potential outlier and note that when comparing 2020 to 2021 data versus the last two years so 12 tests versus thir most recent 13 tests i've significantly reduced phen age relative to 2020 and 2021 as the past 2 years is 34.2 years so an average 1.4e age reduction you know i'm supposed to increase during aging so being able to keep it at least flat or slightly below uh that's a small win all right so this isn't the only biological age metric that i use in addition to epigenetics and metabolomics or microbiome etc i also use aging.ai to track biological aids so what's my data for aging.ai includes 19 component biomarkers and when entering that data as shown here and this is using the north american data set for anyone who wants to double check the numbers i get a predicted age of 28 years which is 22.7 years younger than my chronological now just like we did for the lavine test this is just one test so for more context let's have a look at previous data for aging.ai age which is what we can see here and i have 43 blood tests dating back to 2009 for aging.ai now when i first started tracking i only measured three times within the first 5 years so 2009 to 2013 and over that time span my aging. A age was 32 years and then starting in 2016 i started testing more often and over that that span from 202 2016 to 2022 my average aging.ai age was 29.8 years and that's over 34 tests so what about in 2023 so we can see the most recent test with a 28 predicted age of 28 and thus far over 6 test my average aging. Age in 2023 is 30 years in other words aging. Age has been mostly stable at 30 years old for the past 8 years now what may be contributing to these biological age reductions including diet and or supplements and i'll cover that extensively in the next video coming on sunday but for now let's dig into the full blood test report as there are some highlights and potential low lights that i'd like to focus on so first let's take a look at hdl which at 55 is now within that quote optimal range of 50 to 60 for men being associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk and that's potentially important because i've struggled with relatively low hdl since 2015 over 43 tests since 2015 my average hdl was about 45 milligrams per deciliter but over the past four tests i've averaged 53 milligrams per deciliter and again into that quote unquote optimal range of 5050 to 60 i plan on covering that in terms of correlations what may be assoc or correlated with with that recent improvement so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video conversely triglycerides at 72 aren't terrible uh less than 90 is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk in a big meta analysis but over the last four tests my average triglycerides are 70 migr per deciliter whereas for the 42 tests since 2015 before that it was 58 milligrams per deciliter and you can see using that p value those two groups of data are significantly different so triglycerides have gone in the wrong direction for the last last four test so getting them back lower while keeping hdl high is on the to-do list and then we can see the crp is less than 0.3 and then glucose that brings us to metabolic markers of metabolic health well some some have questioned that my glucose levels being in the high 80s consistently may be a marker of or an early marker of pre-diabetes or being on the road to pre-diabetes so to address that i measured insulin five times in 2022 and my average value for that was 3 milli ius per mill which is pretty insulin sensitive so i also measured hba1c on the same day of this test and i'll have that update coming in a soon uh in a video coming soon all right on to page two a couple of highlights mcv 91.4 that's about age expected i can do better so the goal is to reduce that over the next few tests and then nutrifil which i highlighted two tests ago as they were also less than 2,000 cells per microliter now you can see quest reference range is 1500 to 7,800 but in uh large in at least one large epidemiological study of more than 700,000 people nutrifil is less than 2,000 is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so this that that i've seen that twice over the past three tests that's something i'm defin definitely going to keep an eye on over the next few tests and may consider raising it to to get it above that 2,000 uh cells per microl ler threshold but then there are several other questions including did methyl b12 supplementation and more dietary choline i started eating more or added eggs back into the approach was that able to reduce homosysteine which has been going in the wrong direction for a few tests especially uh probably encouraged by nicotinamide or or s sorry uh uh nicotinic acid supplementation so did the combination of methyl b12 and more dietary choline reduceed homosysteine so i'll include that update in an upcoming video also have i made progress with increasing dhea sulfate as that dhea sulfate has been age expected and relatively low for many tests going back to last year and then last but not least i also measured testosterone on this test so how's my testosterone h how are they how is that looking in terms of age expected data and is it youthful or aged so stay tuned for that in a video coming very soon all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic and tm testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing which includes a b with a completely different panel almost completely different panel than the at home metabolomics green tea diet uh diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trion brand which i've got on here that link and all the other links would be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
