# 35% Increase For Heart Rate Variability Since 2018

## Transcript

With the goal of longevity a major premise of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible with that in mind resting heart rate and heart rate variability provide info about the heart but also the nervous system and adrenal gland which is what we can see here so resting heart rate and heart rate variability are impacted by the balance between the sympathetic nervous system with the parasympathetic nervous system more specifically the vagus nerve but also it's impacted by the adrenal gland which releases norepinephrine and epinephrine which has effects on resting heart rate and heart rate variability in this video we'll cover what's optimal for resting heart rate and heart rate variability in terms of how do these variables change during aging and also what's my data as i now have more than or close to 1800 days of tracking so first how does the resting heart rate change during aging and that's what we can see here and this is whoop data i'm not affiliated or sponsored but this is what i've worn since 2018. On the y-axis we've got the average resting heart rate plotted against age and this is within the 20 to 50 year age range and there we can see that the resting heart rate increases for both men and women up to 50 years data for men in blue data for women in red but what about older than 50 years and that's we can see here this is a study in fitbit users of about 90 000 fitbit users same setup average wrestling heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age but now we can see that the age range goes from 20 to 85 years and in agreement with whoops data we can see that the resting heart rate does indeed increase up until about 50 years old after which it declines so with that in mind note that relatively low wrestling heart rates are found in both young and old or advanced age so is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging that's where heart rate variability comes in as it provides more context so for that context how does the heart rate variability change during aging and that's what we'll see here on the y-axis we've got the root mean squared of successive differences rmssd this is the version of heart rate variability that woo provides and on the x-axis we've got age within the 20 to 60 year age range and then there are two lines there are two the solid lines and the dashed lines the solid lines are heart rate variability at six in the morning and the dashed are at six at night regardless of which plot is used we can see that the heart rate variability declines during aging so now we can address this question of is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging as in younger ages we can see a low resting heart rate or a relatively low resting heart rate in conjunction with a relatively high heart rate variability however at advanced stages we'd expect to see a low wrestling heart rate in conjunction with a low heart rate variability all right so the first six months of 2023 have now passed so is my first two quarters q1 and q2 of 2023 my data for resting heart rate and heart rate variability is that improved year over year when compared with 2022 so let's start off by taking a look at my average yearly resting heart rate and again this is from august of 2018 when i first started tracking through the end of june of 2023 and we can see by the end that's how many days of data that i have and here's how it looks for resting heart rate since 2018 and note that i covered resting heart rate changes over these time period over this time period in earlier videos and i'll put a few in the right corner so if you missed that check it out but since 2018 we can see that i've significantly reduced my resting heart rate from 50.9 beats per minute to 45 beats per minute and again wu provides this data automatically there's no user error involved it provides that automatically every morning so i've reduced it from 50.9 to 45 beats per minute and that was from 2018 to 2022 and we can see by the p-value versus 2018 each year has been better than or each 2022 has been better than 2018 and also in year-over-year changes each year has been significantly lower than the last but what about 2023 that's why we're all here to see if i've improved so far when compared with 2022. So far over the first six months my average resting heart rate is 43.7 beats per minute which when compared with when where i started in 2018 is significantly lower and also when compared with 2022 is also significantly lower so off to a good good start for the resting heart rate significantly reduced in 2022 but when i say that it's off to a good start remember that is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging as we can see here we can see that the low resting heart rates are found in youth 20 year olds but also at advanced ages so am i just experiencing an age-related decline for the resting heart rate since 2018 how would we know so for more context let's have a look at heart rate variability data over this same time period and that's what we can see here and just like we did for resting heart rate i covered 2018 to 2022 heart rate variability changes in earlier videos so i won't rehash that data but over that time span i've increased significantly increased my heart rate variability of 47.3 in 2018 to 59.3 in 2022 but what about 2023 that's why we're here have i improved year over year and when compared with where i started in 2018. Thus far in 2023 my average heart rate variability for the first six months of 2023 is 63.9 milliseconds which is a 35 increase when compared with where i started in 2018 and that's a significant improvement as we can see the p-value is less than 0.05 when compared with 2018 data and it's also significantly better when compared with 2022 data in other words 63.9 over the first six months is significantly higher when compared with the 22 2022 data of 59.3 or actually of all the individual data points that's just just the average so now we can address this question of is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging in my case because based on chronological age based on the plots that i've shown in this video we'd expect to see 35 for heart rate variability and 57 for resting heart rate based on my chronological age of 50 a little more than 50 years but thus far in 2023 my averages for heart rate variability and resting heart rate are 64 44 which is relatively useful based again on the plots that i've shown in this video so what i haven't shown yet though is what's contributing to improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability in 2023 and i'll cover that in the next video on sunday so see you then all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buy hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyfox health which note that their panel is almost exclusively different than the at-home metabolomics and includes april b which i covered in an earlier video die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or diatron brand that link and all of the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
