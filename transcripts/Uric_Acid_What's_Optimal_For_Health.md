# Uric Acid: What's Optimal For Health?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Uric acid as shown here can act as an antioxidant but also as a prooxidant it's involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms but also pro-inflammatory mechanisms so with that in mind what's optimal for uric acid in today's video we'll take a look at how uric acid changes during aging what its association is with all cause mortality risk and then we'll look at n of one data as i have 48 blood tests for uric acid with track dietary data so first uric acid levels increase during aging and that's what we can see here on the y axis we've got circulating levels of uric acid plotted against age on the x and this is from 20 to 80 years old so first starting with the data from men and note that this this study included more than 85,000 men if anyone's come across studies with a larger sample size for both men and women using the aging data and the all cause mortality data that i'm going to present please post those studies in the videoos comments i'd be happy happy to use that in a future video so for men we can see with the red arrows that there's a continuous increase for uric acid during aging for women the story is a bit less clear flat to a small decline up until about 38 years after which there's a continuous increase for uric acid levels during aging in women all right so what about all cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here this study included more than 425,000 people on the y axis we've got the hazard ratio for all cause mortality or risk of death for all causes plotted against circulating levels of uric acid and in this study lowest all cause mortality risk was associated with uric acid levels of 300 micromolar which is equivalent to 5 mg per deciliter so now we can address the question what's optimal for uric acid by combining the data from these two studies 300 micromolar would be what we expect to find in a 20-year-old man and at lowest all cause mortality risk so a good target for men could be 300 micromolar or 5 mig per deciliter but note that 300 micromolar would be what we'd expect to find in a woman of older age approximately 80 years old so that may not be a good target for women in contrast youthful levels of uric acid in women are around 225 micromolar or 3.8 mg per deciliter so how does that value compare against all cause mortality risk and we can see that it's pretty close to lowest risk it's on the pretty close on the bottom of that j-shaped curve so in terms of what's optimal for women a good target could be right around 225 micromolar or 3.8 mg per deciliter but regardless if you're a man or a woman it's important to avoid the age related increase for uric acid and that's because when looking at the all cause mortality data we can see that values greater than about 375 microl are associated with a significantly increased all cause mortality risk as indicated by those red arrows but it is possible to also be too low for uric acid so for that we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of zero and where the 95% confidence interval that shaded the shaded black line is completely above that we have a significant association with all cause mortality risk and that's true when uric acid is less than 175 micromolar or 2.9 mg per deciliter so for uric acid avoid the age related increase but also avoid levels that are too low less than 175 micromolar or 2.9 mg per decil all right so that brings us to part three what's my data so thus far i've resisted the age related uric acid increase and that's what we can see here with data for 48 tests from 2015 to 2024 on the y- axis we've got uric acid levels in milligrams per deciliter plotted against age and here we can see that there is a significant inverse correlation between uric acid with age over these four 48 blood tests since 2015 with a correlation coefficient of ne 0.51 and a p value that's less than 0.05 as the measure of significance so then the big question is how so for those who may not be familiar with my approach since 2015 i've weighed all my food using a food scale i then enter those food amounts into chronometer and if you want to track your own diet there's a discount link for chronometer in the videos video description and then i manually enter the chronometer data into a spreadsheet so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there's a 60-day period in between blood tests because i'm tracking dietary intake the average of those 60 days corresponds to the latter test so every blood test then has a corresponding average dietary intake and with enough track data for both blood test and diet or supplements i can look at correlations and then i calculate those correlations for diet with biomarkers and then with the goal of improving biomarkers i follow as as many of the significant correlations as possible and that's the major way that i've been able to uh resist the age related decline for uric acid and improve other biomarkers too if you if you're familiar with the channel all right so now we're going to take a look at 94 comparisons for uric acid with both food and macro and micronutrients so let's start off with dietary correlations with lower levels of uric acid and that's we can see here on the left we've got the food or nutrient then we've got the p value and not note everything on this list has a p value less than 0.05 as the measure of significance and this is a partial list there are actually 21 significant inverse correlations for foods or nutrients with uric acid so this is a short list it's too big to fit on the slide if you're interested in the full list that data is on the correlations tier on patreon and then for the lowercase end to the right that's the number of tests so for macros and micronutrients i have data for 48 tests because i've been tracking met since 2015 it wasn't until 2018 that i decided to start tracking food intake because the macros and micros are a reductionist version of actually tracking food so starting in 2018 i started tracking food and the macros and micros but unfortunately i only have track data for 34 tests that correspond to biomarkers and then we've got the lowercase r which is the correlation coefficient and you can see that everything on the list is negative in in other words relatively higher levels of the nutrient or food is significantly correlated with lower uric acid and then just going through some of the foods or nutrients on this list they include black pepper ginger turmeric brazilnut and so on down the list all right what about dietary correlations with higher uric acid and that's what we can see here so same setup p value all of these on the list less than 0.05 and then note that this too is a partial list as 23 foods or nutrients were significantly positively correlated with uric acid and then we've got the correlation coefficient and again note that all of the data in that column are positive in other words relatively higher levels of foods or nutrients on this list are significantly correlated with higher uric acid and then in terms of some that are on the list total fructose net carbs vitamin e oxalate caca beans all of those are significantly correlated with a higher uric acid level in my in my data over those 48 tests but that brings us to calorie intake so is are any of these food or nutrients even uh making an impact or a potential dent is it just calorie intake because this data would suggest that relatively higher calories is significant correlated with higher uric acid so maybe that's the driving factor be behind any or all of these correlations so is that true are any of these correlations significant after adjusting for calorie intake so to address that i then created linear regression models adjusted for calorie intake so let's just go through one as an example for black pepper and that's what we can see here so now we've got two variables in the model black pepper and calories in other words is black pepper significantly associated with uric acid after adjusting for calorie intake and so and that's what we can see there with the calories in the model and after doing that we can see that the coefficient is still negative 0.5 and the p value is less than 0.05 in other words yes after adjusting for calorie intake black pepper is still significantly correlated with a lower uric acid so in this case calorie intake is not driving that association so then we put up the calorie adjusted p values for first four black pepper and then going through the list the ones in green are still significant after including calorie intake after adjusting for calorie intake in the model just outside significance are pistachios strawberries and sano peppers as you can see that their calorie adjusted p value is higher than 0.05 as are mushrooms at 0.19 all right so using the same approach for the foods or nutrients that were significantly correlated with higher uric acid uh a few popped up so total fructose net carbs vitamin e cacao beans and vanilla beans were still positively associated with uric acid after adjusting for calorie intake but others on the list dropped out so now we can see which foods or nutrients may impact uric acid after accounting for calorie intake both positively and negatively and then the goal would be to follow as many of these correlations as possible with the goal of keeping uric acid relatively low all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a
