Animal products including meat cheese and eggs contain carnitine and choline metabolites that are converted by gut bacteria into trimethylamine tma tma then travels from the intestine into the blood and then to the liver where it is converted uh by liver enzymes to tmao trimethylamine oxide so why is tma what is tmao and why is it important so first uh higher plasma levels of tmao are associated with an increased risk for heart attack atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease so let's have a look at that data here so on the y-axis we're looking at cardiovascular disease related outcomes mi myocardial infarction pad peripheral arterial uh disease so that's atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries coronary artery disease atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries the combination of those two pad plus cad and cardiovascular disease cad so on the x-axis here we have levels of tmao in quartiles so one would be the lowest quartile of tmao in blood plasma and plasma in blood uh and then two three and four are sequentially higher levels of plasma levels of tmao and what we can see is that for each quartile above the lowest quartile of tmao there's an increased risk for each of these cardiovascular disease related outcomes so it isn't just an increased risk for heart attack atherosclerosis and cbd higher levels of tmao are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so let's have a look at that data and that's we can see here cumulative survival on the y-axis plotted against time and compared to the lowest tmao quartile so people who had the lowest level of tmao in their blood the two highest levels of tmao were associated with a 71 percent and an 86 increased all-cause mortality acm risk for the q3 and q4 the third and fourth quartiles of plasma levels of tmao all right so based on these two uh data the idea would be okay if you reduce animal products you'll reduce circulating levels of tmao and then you'll potentially reduce risk for heart attack atherosclerosis cbd and all-cause mortality but there's more to this story and more to this story involves the impact of fish fish directly contains tmao so how does fish contribute to the tmao story so um what happens if you eat different meals uh whether it's fish chicken red or processed meat so this is that study we're looking at plasma levels of tma on the y-axis and time on the x-axis so they gave people these uh four different meals again chicken red meat rm pm processed meat or fish in this case which was haddock and they looked at their tmao levels in blood uh in the first week w1 week two and week three and then uh at three different time points after eating uh each of these foods so t-zero would be the baseline plasma tml measurement t2 two hours after eating it and 24 hours after eating uh each of these four meals so first what we can see with the arrow is that uh chicken red meat and processed meat had people weight that had the lowest levels of tmao and almost no spike in tmao levels in their blood after eating them however look at the fish meal so people that eat the fish meal compared with their baseline values we can see the highest levels dramatically higher levels of plasma tmao when compared with each of the other meats so if the tmao story uh and it's linked to disease is true we'd expect to see a higher all-cause mortality risk for fish eaters is that true and actually that's not true so this is data in a meta-analysis from a meta-analysis of uh 400 about 400 000 people uh in 10 studies so risk for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against fish consumption and what we can see is that the lowest all-cause mortality risk is present for fish consumption in the 50 to 100 grams per day range so when considering the contribution of fish to the tmao story there must be other factors that can help clarify uh it can't be as simple as tma higher tmao and blood uh higher disease and mortality risk it can't be that simple so what are some of these other factors so uh in this study groupin's group decided to look at the impact of kidney function on all-cause mortality risk and they separated subjects into two groups based on their kidney function so here we're looking at the estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr and they used plasma measurements of creatinine and system c to determine uh egfr which is a measure of kidney function and in this group uh the average kidney function or egfr was 76. Now what we can see for the crude association so simply the unadjusted association for plasma levels of tmao with all-cause mortality risk we can see a significant association for tmao with acm risk 29 increase and then when they included other factors into that statistical model so model one and model two model one being adjusted for age and sex model two being adjusted for age sex and urinary acid excretion uae which is another measure of kidney function we can see that subjects who had an egfr less than 90 had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality for each of these models or in the unadjusted mom so what about in subjects that had an egfr greater than 90 that's what we're looking at here so uh in this in this group the egfr average egfr was 104 so good kidney function so what was the association with plasma levels of tmao with all-cause mortality risk and people who had better or good kidney function so first i'm looking at the unadjusted association so simply uh plasma levels of tmao versus all-cause mortality risk there was no significant association uh similarly when they included age and sex model one or age sex and urinary acid excretion sorry urinary albumin excretion that's as a measure of an additional measure of kidney function uh so regardless of which model that included these factors the association between plasma levels of tmao with all caused mortality risk was not statistically significant so that's what this data shows here so kidney function may have uh an important role in the tmao story so if that's true what about the data that i showed earlier for the association between tmao with risk of heart attack after atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease so if you notice on in this plot they have the unadjusted association for tmao which each with each of the cardiovascular related outcomes and then under that they have the adjusted data so in their adjusted models they included estimated creatinine clearance which is a measure of kidney function so superficially one could say well they adjusted for kidney function and this disputes your hypothesis that kidney function may be the uh one of the most important factors in the tmao story however upon closer inspection the average gfr glomerular filtration rate as a measure of kidney function in this study was 73 and the range for the subjects in the study was 60 to 86. Now if you remember in the previous slide all caused mortality risk was increased for an egfr less than 90 but not higher than 90. So this data agrees with that these subjects have an egfr less than 90. The all-cause mortality risk data had an egfr9 with less than 90. So this would further suggest an important role for kidney function on the link between tmao with risk of disease and death so as a final uh nail in that coffin uh here we see plasma levels of tmao on the y-axis plotted against quartiles of egfr so quartiles of uh kidney function increasing from 66 to 91 91 being good kidney function 66 being the worst kidney function and what we can see is that people that had egfr's uh higher than 91 so good kidney function had the lowest levels of plasma tmao conversely the subjects that had the worst kidney function 66 for an egfr had the highest levels of tmao so once again it seems like kidney function plays an important role in the tmao health and disease and mortality story so if your egfr is greater than 90 going back to the original slide knowing that tmao is formed by eating animal products including meat eggs and cheese and fish so if your egfr is greater than 90 eating these foods may not be an issue in terms of tmao related risk but egfr declines during aging and that's what we can see here i've presented this data in in another video i'll link to that video for kidney function in the right corner so this is a data from a study of about 378 000 people where we can clearly see egfr declined for egfr plotted against age so around 40 years of age for both men and women egfr drops on average to less than 90. So in that situation i'd say reducing animal products if your egfr levels are lower than 90 may be important for decreasing risk of tmao related health issues all right that's uh all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
