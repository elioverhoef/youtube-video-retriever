# Whole Body Flexibility Is Associated With Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that having a higher grip strength was associated with a lower risk of death for all causes or acm risk and that's what we'll see here so this is a meta analysis of 42 studies that included more than 3 million people on the yis we've got the hazard ratio of all cause mortality or risk of death for all causes plotted against grip strength in kilogram in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and note that where the dash black line this is the 95% confidence interval if that's completely below that hazard ratio of one we have a significant association and we can see that that's true for all grip strength values greater than about 10 kilg with the greatest association or the greatest risk reduction or association with reduced risk of death for all causes being at a grip strength greater than 54 kg which was associated with a 65% reduced risk of death similarly a higher v2 max is associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here so in this study which included about 750,000 people also relatively large we saw that having a v2 max of 50 was associated with a 76% reduced risk of death for all causes or compared with the lowest v2 max group that had a v2 max of 16 now an underrated component of fitness is flexibility and whole body flexibility is also associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes so the first question is then how was flexibility evaluated and that's what we can see with this list of 20 different movements this is the flex index which is a body flexibility index which looked at range of motion or rom for 20 different movements which included all of the major joints including the ankle knee hip trunk wrist elbow and shoulder and then each of these 20 movements and i'll put screenshots for all 20 movements at the end of this video so if you want to calculate your own scores to see how well your whole body flexibility score might be or how good it is that'll be uh you know at towards the end of the video so each of these movements was scored from lowest to highest from zero to four so that raises the question what's optimal since it's now scored whole body flexibility is scored what's optimal so one way i define that is starting off with how does it change during aging so it shouldn't be a surprise but whole body flexibility as indicated by the flex index declines during a and that's what we'll see here with the flex index on the y- axis plotted against age and this is the age group is from 46 to 65 years and in this study it's relatively small about 3100 people but as far as i know there are no other studies looking at a whole body flexibility me uh metric index on all cause mortality risk so as far as i know this is the only study that exists all right for both men in green and women in yellow we can see that whole body flexibility index scores declin during aging also note that women at any age in this study had significantly higher whole body flexibility than the men all right now a higher flex index is also associated with reduced all cause mortality and that's what we'll see here with data from men on the left and women on the right on the y- axis we've got the probability of survival so who is alive and or how many people were alive and how many people were had died uh plotted against days on the x and in studies for survival studies we generally look at median survival this is the time at 50% survival that's the time when half of the population has died and half is still alive and i've indicated with the blue arrow that for the lowest flex index score which is highlighted in red so at that time point 50% of that red group were alive and 50% had died when compared with the baseline start you know starting from the the beginning of the study now at that time point when comparing the group with the highest flexibility index scores only 14% had died relative to 50% in the worst scoring group and for the intermediate flexibility group about 19% had died so we can see that having both high and intermediate levels of whole body flexibility was associated with a significant significantly improved survival relative to the worst whole body flexibility index score group in men what about in women so first looking at 50% survival or median survival we can see that none of the groups made it there so instead we can look at 60% survival at this time point that's when 60% of the red group was alive and 40% had died and at that time point when looking at the highest flexibility uh index score for women only about 3 to 4% had died whereas the lowest scoring group 40% had died and for the intermediate flexibility group we can see that only about 12% had died again in compared when compared with the worst flexibility group 40% had died so here too in women we can see that there is a significantly higher survival which is associated with both high and intermediate flexibility all right so what is this just healthy user bias is this just a measure of people who have higher v2 max and higher whole body strength you know regular fitness enthusiasts is just is this just a healthy user bias where they probably also have a better whole body flexibility so one way to account for that is by adjusting the survival models for factors that can impact the associ ation and to potentially uh do that they adjusted these models for age bmi and health status including major diseases like cardiovascular disease cancer respiratory disease diabetes obesity and dyslipidemia but these models were not adjusted for fitness status and hopefully in future studies we'll see studies where they looked at whole body flexibility and associations with all cause mortality risk after accounting for v2 max and some index of muscle strength you know whether it's scrip strength or or something else and that'll help to tease out how much of the flexibility whole body flexibility index score is actually related to all cause mortality risk it may be that v2 max and strength are better predictors and the flexibility really has nothing to do with it so we don't yet know that but this these data are suggestive that it could be involved additionally we don't know about causation so if we improve somebody's whole body flexibility range of motion for all of those 20 movements do we see improvements in health related measures and potentially longevity as far as i know there are no randomized control trials for that so we'll have to wait for those studies to be published all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bioh biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and
