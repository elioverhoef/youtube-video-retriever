# 15y Younger Biological Age: Meds, Supplements, Diet (Blood Test #7 in 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number s in 2024 when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag we saw that my biological age was 15.2 years younger than the chronological so what might be contributing to these data so let's start off with prescription meds and for those who are familiar with the channel the first shouldn't be a surprise i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking levothyroxin for about half of my life more specifically 137.5 micrograms per day the second though may be a surprise it won't be a surprise for people who follow me on patreon but it may be a surprise for everybody else and i started taking rapid me 1 milligram per day for 7 days now before many start to think that rapid me had some impact on blood test number seven's results it's important to note when i did that 7-day experiment so the 49-day period that corresponds to test number seven went from september 6th through october 24th of 2024 so that 49-day period is immediately after test number six and it lasted through the day before test number 7even now i did the rap rapy experiment starting on september 10th so i had about a one- month wash out with no rap ayon so it's unlikely that rapon had any impact on these results so why did i include it rap ay is a known antifungal and for whatever reason candida antibodies more specifically igg have been relatively elevated for all tests in 2024 so i took rep me to see if i could bring candida igg levels down towards the lower end of the reference range which it didn't unfortunately so i took it out i still have a supply of rapy so i'm open to doing that experiment at at another point but for now rapy is out of the approach which then brings us to supplements and here too for those who are familiar with the channel the first shouldn't be a surprise i supplement with vitamin d about 8 to nine months out of the year as i currently live in boston and i can't get adequate full body sun exposure so for the 49-day period that corresponded to test number 7 2,000 ius of vitamin vitamin d for all of the 49 days the second is nicotinic acid very low dose 50 to 60 milligrams per day and i took that for 36 of the 49 days that corresponded to test number seven and i i did that specifically to increase ned or keep ned from being closer to the low end of my range now rather than just assuming that taking nicotinic acid or any supplement will impact a given biomarker i actually measured it so on the same day as test number seven i sent blood to gfinity for ned analysis and on the test number 7 day october 25th ned levels were 31.7 micromolar so what does that mean let's put that into per perspective so for test number six i supplemented with nicotinic acid lowd dose nicotinic acid for a similar percentage of days 28 out of the 42 days that corresponded to test number six but ned levels on that on that same day is test number six were relatively lower 21.1 micromolar but nonetheless we can see the test number seven a little bit higher than test number six but then the big question is or a question could be if if i supplemented with the same amount of days of using nicotinic acid why aren't ned levels the same that seems 10 micromolar is about a 30% amount of variability well it's important to know when i took the nicotinic acid so for the 5 days before testing for test number six i didn't take any nicotinic acid but for all of those 5 days and beyond for test number seven i included nicotinic acid so we can see that any ned levels are very sensitive to taking ned precursors for at least a 5day period before testing all right that's it for supplements which then brings us to diet what diet composition what diet composition corresponds to test number seven's results and that's what we'll see here this is the average daily dietary intake for that 49-day period that corresponds to test number seven and for those who don't know i weigh everything with the food scale i then enter that into chronometer put that data into a spreadsheet so these aren't estimations but as close as one can get to actual intake in terms of the food list that's what's shown here i ate 54 different foods and this list is ranked in grams with the with three exceptions green tea which is in ounces and if you want to use what i use which is organic loose leaf green tea from japan there's a discount link in the video description and then two others on this list are not list listed in gram including ice cream and popcorn and we'll get more into that into the cheat day cheat meals section of the video but first at this point in the video i always ask were they were there any experiments for this test so the goal is to make small changes to the diet and supplements with the goal of uh improving weak spots optimizing weak spots like lipoprotein a ded and paast horvath homocysteine dhea sulfate which seems like a long list i know but the goal is to make small changes to improve those biomarkers without blowing everything else because a lot of my data is also youthful so what were some of the experiments that i did for this test well first strawberry i increased it from 319 g up back up to 510 and i did that because for the last test test number six i cut total fructose intake including strawberries that wasn't uh correlated with my best biological age or other biomarker data so i increased strawberries back to where they were before test number six relatively high 510 grams per day i also increased sardines from 107 to about 143 gram per day and i did that to test correlations for horvath's epigenetic age and homocysteine i also increased lowfat yogurt and for those who will say well just go full fat for whatever reason dairy saturated fatty acids if i eat dairy consistently and full fat that's significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so unfortunately full fat dairy has to be limited in my approach so with that in mind i do eat lowfat yogurt i increased it from 8 gam per day an average of 8 g per day to 117 for test number seven and i did that to test the correlation with the nighttime respiratory rate which superficially may not seem like an important biomarker but it's a biomarker of immune activation so uh i did that experiment and it may not have uh made a dent but nonetheless i increased lowfat yogurt to test that correlation i also increased oranges from zero on the prior test up to 35 g per day and i did that to test its correlation with dhea sulfate i also increased caca beans and if you saw the donen pay video you know why you can see that i increase caca beans from an average of 1 to about 12 gram per day caca beans are significally correlated with a lower mcv which is a component of dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno agage but in my case they're also significally correlated with lower lipoprotein a and knowing that lipoprotein a is a part of the denan pace algorithm i i decided to test that correlation by increasing cacao bean intake now another part of the lipoprotein a story in my case may be flax seeds so flax seeds are a rich source of gamma tocoferol which is one of the vitamin e isoforms in my data higher gamma tocoferol is significantly correlated with a higher lipoprotein a and knowing that i want a lower lipoprot a with the goal of slowing my epigenetic pace of aging don't need and pace i also cut flax seeds by a relatively small amount from 26 to about 16 grams per day and in terms of uh uh oysters i added oysters into the approach the oysters are a new addition so for those who have been following the channel for a while this is the first time they've been in the approach since 2015 since i started tracking diet and that's not 5 grams per day where i just took a little bit every day that's 165 g can of oysters per week so why did i do that experiment so oysters are a rich source of zinc 59 mig per can and for whatever reason uh zinc in my data i shouldn't say for whatever reason there are probably many mechanistic ways that zinc can be involved in improving some of these biomarkers including candida antibodies igg but also torine so i i added oysters into the approach to increase zinc with the goal of potentially impacting candida uh igg levels and torine which then brings us back to ice cream and popcorn which are portion of the cheat meals section of the video so they were clearly cheap meals and for those who don't know immediately after blood test i don't pay much attention to meeting my food macro and m micronutrient goals so i kind of you know eat whatever i want uh you know within reason and while trying to stick to calorie goals and i do that for a couple days you know two to three days at most following the blood test and then i shut it off no more no more junk completely sticking to the whole foods clean diet until the next blood test and using that approach it keeps me satiated as i can eat a little bit of junk but then i also don't crave it after i've had it so it's it it works for me but in terms of the cheat meals i also added sugar so there too that's not8 grams per day that's 40 gams on one of the days following the blood test i added that to a mix of macadamia nuts cacao beans and dates which i blended all together but i should say that wasn't ass satiating in some other things that i eat on cheat days including uh homemade reese's peanut butter cups in terms of junk calories the oreo ice well the the ice cream sandwiches were oreo ice cream sandwiches in hindsight it probably wasn't ice cream on the box it said frozen dairy dessert so or frozen dessert so probably a mix of just chemical stuff that maybe you know has the texture of ice cream in hindsight that was a bad idea it tasted pretty good though uh and following test number seven uh i had you know homemade ice cream i made homemade ice cream with heavy wh whipping cream so stay tuned for that update uh in the next video update uh for test number eight all right so in terms of junk calories 8.40 from the ice cream sandwiches 220 from popcorn technically pop the pop pop corn isn't junk it was uh air pop not oil pop but still i've included it on the list and then the sugar contributed 155 calories in total junk calories were 1215 and when dividing that by all of the calories consumed for this 49-day period it's 1.2% of total calories in other words the diet was 99% clean which is correlated with that 15 year younger biological age now in terms of how much leeway to go there in terms of how clean does one need the diet to be to have their best biomark results i haven't played around with that i think that's a slippery slope if i start to go to you know eat foods that are less clean maybe i go to three 4% maybe i start to crave junk food more and i don't want that to happen at all for me 1 to 2% at most junk uh keeping it really high clean works well for long-term adherence all right so this list is ranked in grams what about ranking foods based on calor intake and that's what we'll see here these are the top 10 foods for average daily calorie intake for that 49 day period that corresponded to test number seven and this list is generated by chronometer if you want to track your own diet using chronometer there's a discount link in the video's description so at top the list as it has been for many tests is sardines sardines are my top source of calories and then without going through everything on the list seven of the 10 foods that are on this list were the same as they were for test number six so again not trying to blow up the system make small changes to the diet while keeping everything else close to the same to make know to optimize a few biomarkers without blowing up everything else in terms of foods that entered it was beets coconut butter and pistachios and for foods that left the top 10 relative to test number six corn oats and chickpeas and in terms of why corn and oats i reduced them for this test it was to do another experiment with total fat intake but we'll get into that in a second all right so what macronutrient composition we covered foods corresponds to test number seven so first in terms of average daily calorie intake 21 130 per day and that's close to but not my lowest intake since 2015 uh lowest intake is 2076 and if you saw the lymp asite video or if you missed it i'll link to that in the right corner you'll know why in terms of average daily protein intake 102 gram per day which is 19% around 19% of total calories fat intake shown here for test number seven was 89.5 gam per day which is about 38% of total calories now for perspective we'll pull up test number six data and we can see that i purposefully increased fat intake from 82 to around 90 g per day now that might not seem like a big jump but going too high for fat intake for whatever reason in my data is significantly correlated with more biomarkers sorry more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i'm trying to make small increases to try to find the sweet spot you know the lowest the lowest bottom the bottom of the u-shape right not too low not too high what's the what's the bottom of the u that optimizes more biomarkers than not so in terms of where that f increase came from it was mostly from saturated fat from cacao beans and you know you can see that there's about a 7 g increase there we can also see the reduction in flax seeds led to less omega-3 test over test 8.4 vers 9.5 i was able to keep omega 6 relatively constant but it's not a perfect system of just making small changes and and keeping everything else the same as we can see monounsaturated fat intake was about five grams less for this test relative to the last all right what about carbon intake so that's what we'll see here total carbs was about 265 g per day which seems like a lot i know i say this in each of these videos in series you know diet composition videos but for those who don't know total carbs equals uh net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber so average daily fiber intake for this test was 79 gam per day when subtracting that from total carbs yields a net carbs of 188 gam per day well multiplying that by four calories per gram we get a net carb percentage of 35% % net carbs now in terms of calories fiber also produces some amount of calories that's because a fraction of total fiber is soluble fiber which means that it's fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids in other words a fraction of total fiber intake is converted into fat so in terms of how much of that was convert converted into fat 166 calories from fiber was converted into fat and that's about 8% of total calories so now we can see that the the net macros that correspond to the 15 year younger biological age of about 46% fat which includes the amount coming from fiber fermentation by gut bacteria 35% net carbs and 19% protein now before leaving the total carbs i also track sugar intake but not total sugars because sugars aren't a homogeneous group for example glucose fructose sucrose lactose i mean i can go down the list there are many different sugars but within that group i track total fructose intake with sucrose being half fructose so when adding those two together i track total fructose intake because a higher total fructose intake in my data is significant correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right for this test total fructose intake was 58 gram per day which is not my lowest my lowest was test number six but as we saw for test number six that wasn't a part of my best biomarker data so i increased total fructose back to where it's been around 58 gams per day i know that may seem like a lot but that's about half as high as total fructose has been since 2015 so progress albeit not perfection all right which brings us then to micronutrients what micronutrient profile corresponds to this test so we'll see the full list for vitamins and minerals it may be hard to see the vitamins so i'd recommend going full screen if you haven't already and for anyone that's starting on this journey of tracking diet with the goal of optimizing biomarkers i'd recommend at the very least very least making sure that you've got full r coverage for all vitamins and minerals and if you go down the list you can see that that's true uh choline looks a bit low but unfortunately the uh diet entry for sardines that i use in chronometer doesn't have a coline amount from the sardines so when i manually add that in my own spreadsheet i get the rda for choline but then taking that a step further i'm also measuring plasma levels of choline and the iola metabolomic kit which is not low so uh even though choline is around the rda based on plasma levels intake is only one side of that equation my coline levels in plasma aren't relatively low so that's good new news now also note that many micronutrients are are much higher than the rda purposely much higher as i'm following their correlations with about 25 different biomarkers and that doesn't include correlations with the epigenetics or metabolomics just standard clinical chemistry biomarkers and i use that data to guide the diet so just as an example for some of the nutrients here that are much higher than the rda or what's defined as an adequate intake are carotenoids and that's because in at least few papers a relatively higher intake of carotenoids is significantly associated with a younger epigenetic age so if you go down a list of alpha beta keratin beta crypto anthan lutein and zanthin and lopine you can see that my intake of those carotenoids are relatively high all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i include those biomarker correlations and before you go
