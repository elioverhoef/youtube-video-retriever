# Serine + Vitamin B6: No Effect On Homocysteine (Test #2)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In terms of longevity in an earlier video we saw that serine plus vitamin b6 may be the best way to reduce homocysteine and if you missed that let's do a quick recap here starting with dietary intake of folic acid that's converted into serum folate which in combination with vitamin b12 will convert homocysteine into methionine similarly dietary intake of betaine otherwise known as trimethylglycine or choline which is converted into betaine will also convert homocysteine into methionine but decreasing homocysteine to increase methionine may not be a good strategy for longevity as methionine restriction extends lifespan in animal models whether that's true or not in people nobody knows yet in contrast adding serine plus vitamin b6 can convert homocysteine into cystothionine which in the presence of adequate b6 will further convert cystothinine into cysteine which can then be incorporated into gsh or glutathione now there are videos on the channel where glutathione restoration in older adults clinical trials and older adults improved a whole bunch of adverse health related outcomes and extended lifespan in mice so i think serine plus b6 or i have thought we'll see how the data looks maybe the best way to reduce homocysteine so for my fourth blood test in 2023 did serine plus b6 reduce homocysteine so to recap that journey for the second test i didn't supplement with with any serine and my normal dietary intake of vitamin b6 three milligrams per day resulted in a homocysteine of 11.1 micromolar then for the april test i started supplementing with serine about 2 grams per day increased my b6 intake through supplementation eight milligram supplementation per day to 11 milligrams per day and that started to push or normal variation i don't know but homocysteine went in the right direction for that test for the most recent test in july i further increased serine levels to about 4 grams per day and then tripled my b6 intake again through supplementation where it's 12x higher than where i started for the march test but unfortunately homocysteine did not go in the right direction it went back towards where 11.1 where it was for the second test so then the question is why didn't it work why didn't serine plus b6 reduce homocysteine so then the first question could be is did nicotinic acid supplementation increase homocysteine so i started niacin supplementation nine days before the july test and that increased my nad but it may have pushed homocysteine higher and why that's true can be shown here on the y-axis we've got plasma levels of homocysteine and this is a study done in young adults 20 to 23 year olds relatively small study of 30 people so after three hours uh being fed water which was the control what was fed to controls we can see that there was no increase for plasma levels of homocysteine three hours after consuming the water but for young adults that consume 300 milligrams of the other b3 vitamin b3 or niacin form niacinamide we can see that there was a big increase for homocysteine from 11 around 11 to 16 micromolar after one one and a half hours of supplementation and then three hours after the supplementation homocysteine went up even further to about 18 micromolar what about nicotinic acid that's what i was supplementing with i wasn't supplementing with niacinamide so that data is shown there for people who were supplemented with 300 milligrams of nicotinic acid although it wasn't a significant increase we can see that homocysteine did indeed move in the quote-unquote wrong direction towards higher levels after an hour and a half which plateaued from an hour and a half to three hours but note that i wasn't taking 300 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day i was taking double that around 600 milligrams per day so it's possible that supplementing with nicotinic acid which raised my nad may have pushed homocysteine in the wrong direction alternatively besides reacting with homocysteine serine can be converted into other metabolites including cysteine and glycine so is that what happened so in terms of a recap of why that could be true serine is converted into cysteine without affecting homocysteine as i showed on the previous slide and we can see that here so starting with cysteine on the uh sorry serine on the left and the presence of acetyl-coa it's converted into oacetylserine and then then in the presence of h2s otherwise known as thiosulfate that's converted into cysteine and note that's without affecting homocysteine in these two enzymatic reactions similarly serine is converted into glycine also without impacting homocysteine so starting with serine in the presence of h4 folate or tetrahydrofolate that's converted into glycine so again is that what happened now i have metabolomic data which includes data for serine cysteine and glycine so we can address or attempt to address that question and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me use this kit which is a gold mine of metabolites and metabolite data for kanyurine tryptophan as part of the parts of a part of the day noble entity synthesis pathway taurine and polyamines which extend lifespan cysteine and cystine methionine sulfoxide divided by methionine as markers of oxidative stress metabolite ratios is markers of oxidative stress epa and dha fish oil fatty acids which decline during aging and as i mentioned this kid is a gold mine 500 plus metabolites and data for that much discount link in the video's description all right so on to the data so i have two blood tests so far using the io kit in april and may and for those two tests i supplemented with 2 grams and 4 grams respectively of serine per day and then below that we've got blood levels of serine cysteine and glycine so starting with serine we can see that there was a 70 micromolar drop despite doubling my serine intake so that's either variability in the test itself or it was consumed somehow that 70 micromolar was being consumed somewhere definitely not to reduce homocysteine though now it wasn't serine wasn't converted into glycine as we can see that my glycine levels were pretty close to stable from 313 to about 301 micromolar if serine was converted into glycine we'd expect to see an increase in glycine for that second test but that's not what happened in contrast there is an increase for cysteine and again i don't know if this is normal variability test the test just from the iola kit but that cysteine level went up by about 80 percent and granted that doesn't make up for the about 60 micromolar drop from 170 to 110 for serine it's as it's only about an eight micromolar increase for cysteine but it does suggest that some of the serine could have been converted into cysteine without affecting homocysteine now with that in mind i haven't given up on serine yet for the next test i'm going to go higher 6 grams per day i've been supplementing with that for a few weeks now and i'm going to continue fighting with vitamin b6 so i'm going to give it one more chance to reduce homocysteine only this time i'm going to take niacin or nicotinic acid out completely so if serine plus b6 has any effect very high dose serine has any effect on homocysteine we should see it on the next test and if we don't i'm going to take it out of the approach all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to buy hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel is almost completely different from the at-home metabolomics including apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
