# Biohacking the Oral Microbiome

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Oral bacteria have been linked with multiple adverse health related conditions which is what we can see here so starting with inside the mouth they've been linked with dental caries or cavities primary endodontic infection or dental root infection periodontal disease or gum disease dry mouth but also dry eyes so sjogren's syndrome and then oral bacteria have been linked with conditions outside of the mouth too including atherosclerotic plaque pneumonia rheumatoid arthritis and lupus so with that in mind how can we optimize oral bacterial composition so to me the first step is quantification so with the goal of quantifying oral bacterial composition i used bristle and if you're interested in quantifying your own oral bacterial composition you can use my discount link conquerage or conquer aging 15 and that link will be in the video's description so what's my oral bacterial composition and i've listed most of it here this is 98.3 percent of my full oral bacterial composition uh just there wasn't enough space on the slide to put all of it but you can see that the lowest relative abundance so how much of each bacteria uh on on a scale of a hundred percent is in the sample you can see that that goes down to 0.2 percent so um so very low amount so we've got 1.7 that's missing if anybody's interested uh which is missing just leave a comment i'll be happy to post that information so first i want to know are there are any of these bacteria linked with oral and or systemic health you know it's great to get the data but what does it mean is it good or bad so first in terms of bacteria oral bacteria that have been linked with health oral health there are two main genera so in my saliva this is a saliva sample i have a decent amount of both of those genera uh with the sum of about 53 percent for for both nessaria and rothia in my salivary microbiome so is 53 for just these two bacteria or these two bacterial genera is that optimal for oral health and nobody knows uh that's the honest truth there there's a paucity of studies on how the oral microbiome changes during aging and its association with all-cause mortality risk uh so that data just doesn't exist yet all right so how does my oral bacterial composition compare with bacteria that have been linked with oral and systemic health so this data that we just showed earlier so first starting in the mouth uh i'm going to start with one bacterium streptococcus mutans which has been linked with uh cavity formation so dental caries now in my salivary sample there was no streptococcus streptococcus mutants in my data so the question is why now i make a homemade mouthwash that contains xylitol so that may be one reason why i didn't have any of this bacterium in my sample so let's take a look at that data so the growth of this bacterium again streptococcus mutants is limited in the presence of one percent xylitol so here we're looking at levels in vitro levels of uh streptococcus mutans in specifically it's the strain two three six six s one so the c is control levels of this bacterium without any xylitol and then we can see increasing levels of xylitol in the in the media and then what happened to growth so when compared with the control sample that had no xylitol and when compared with one percent xyle to 1.1 percent x as shown by the green arrow we can see that there was a 76 percent reduction for streptococcus mutants in the presence of 1 xylitol now what about xylitol's potency against other strains of this bacterium so just because it works against one strain there may be many strains and if this is the only strain it works against then why use xylitol at all so here we're looking at the inhibition percentage for the for xylitol against other streptococcus mutans uh strains and specifically there are five the one i just showed which is 23 66 s1 but then four other uh streptococcus mutant strange as uh strains as shown by the black arrows and what we can see is that in the presence of one percent xylitol there's a 61 to 76 percent uh growth inhibition of this bacterium in the presence of one percent xylitol so with these data in mind i make my own homemade mouthwash containing one percent xylitol and that's one gram of xylitol per 100 milliliters of water which then raises the question what else is in the mouthwash so to help address that let's take a look at what happens with an increase in oral acidity which is a major contributor to tooth decay so here we're looking at on the y axis at plaque ph so the plaque is a sticky substance on teeth and as a function of time starting at time zero after exposure to a glucose rinse so for the person who has active cavity formation after the glucose rinse after exposure to the glucose rinse we can see a rapid decline in plaque ph to below 5.5 all the way down to about 4.5 so why is a ph an oral ph of 5.5 important well that that's the quote-unquote critical ph and there that's a high risk for cavity formation when the ph drops the oral ph drops or plaque ph more specifically drops below 5.5 so for the person who has active cavity formation after the glucose rinse there's that rapid decline to below 5.5 all the way down to 4.5 and then you can see they spend a significant amount of time below 5.5 as indicated by the area under the curve auc the red region and then unfortunately the person a person has active cavity formation also has a slow recovery to above 5.5 now in contrast for the person who has inactive cavity formation after the glucose rinse there is a small dip below the ph of black ph of 5.5 but then there's a rapid recovery away from that zone and for the person who's resistant to cavity formation we can see that after the glucose rinse the plaque ph never approaches 5.5 and there's also a quick recovery uh after that initial dip from a ph of around 6.8 to around six to back up to 6.8 pretty quickly all right so with this in mind to limit oral ph drops below a ph of 5.5 i add sodium bicarbonate which is a base so i basically out alkanize alkalinize uh i alkalinize my mouth and for that i use one gram of sodium bicarbonate per 100 milliliters of water and i chose that amount because the salt concentration of blood is point nine percent so this is one percent sodium bicarbonate so it's essentially uh close to isotonic with plasma so one gram per 100 ml of sodium bicarbonate also is in the homemade mouthwash all right so what else is in the mouthwash and i raised that issue because p gingivalus has been linked with adverse health conditions both both inside and away from the mouth as we can see by the red arrows for atherosclerotic plaque for pneumonia arthritis periodontal disease uh sjogren's syndrome and also root primary endodontic infection and i put how much of that that i have for each of these conditions so i have point two percent of my total levels of salivary bacteria are p gingivalis now that's not a lot i'd say that that's trending towards very low uh amounts of p gingivals and one reason for that is because also in the mouthwash is peppermint oil and there weren't any pretty pictures from this paper but in this paper meyer at all 1993 and i'll leave that paper in the video's description peppermint oil inhibits the growth of p gingivalus so also in the mouthwash is two drops of peppermint oil per one 1000 ml per liter now is that optimal i don't know is that causing my relatively low levels of of p gingivals i don't know but um it's in the mouthwash and it's a correlation for having relatively low levels of of this bacterium all right to summarize for what's good for my oral my salivary microbiome i don't have any streptococcus mutants which has been linked with uh cavity formation i have relatively low levels of p gingivalis which again is associated with a whole bunch of adverse health related conditions and i have relatively high levels of nasaria and raphia which have been linked with oral health so what's not good so i have relatively high levels or at least greater than or equal to 0.2 percent of bacteria that have been previously previously linked with adverse oral and or systemic health and i've listed them here in red so starting with atherosclerotic plaque i have two of these bacteria including tannerella forsythia and streptococcus sanguine so i have two percent of my total bacteria are related to i guess atherosclerotic plaque i have bacteria related to rheumatoid arthritis uh i have backed four bacteria that are linked with dental root infections and then i have three bacteria that are linked with lupus so to me that's not sufficient i don't want to have any bacteria that have been linked with adverse health-related conditions both in the mouth and outside of the mouth so how can i reduce levels of at least some of these bacteria if not all now for that there's as i mentioned there's very little information on the oral microbiome the salivary microbiome especially when compared with the gut microbiome and even fewer studies on randomized control trials for interventions to improve the oral microbiome so defining what an oral microbiome is very few papers but then even less how to optimize it now one of the papers fortunately for how to optimize it is an in vitro study that's i've shown the title here nitrate as a potential prebiotic for the oral microbiome now to define some terms a prebiotic is a substance that feeds already existing bacteria which enables their growth so how can nitrate act as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome so starting from a diet rich in nitrate and that includes green vegetables beets carrots and other foods those foods are nitrate rich so the direct effect is to increase oral levels of nitrate no3 minus in the mouth now the indirect effect is after you eat nitrate containing foods that increases the plasma concentration of nitrate which is which then gets concentrated in the parotid gland and other salivary glands which then release nitrate into the mouth so how does nitrate impact the oral microbiome so in this study they looked at and again it's a very small study but again there is very few data that exists in this subject unfortunately they use saliva from 12 quote unquote healthy donors they didn't define the age it was only men unfortunately they didn't use women they didn't identify bmi or diet or any other factors so quote-unquote healthy donors from 12 people 12 men was incubated with nitrate and what was the effect of this nitrate exposure to saliva in vitro on the levels of oral bacteria so on the y-axis we're looking at the levels of nitrate relative to the controls that were not treated controlled saliva that wasn't treated with nitrate and then on the x-axis we've got how each of the individual oral bacteria changed after exposure to nitrate and that's after five hours in light green and darker green after nine hours so first note that there were significant increases for the oral health-related bacteria nasaria and raffia in the presence of nitrate so you can see those three uh actually it's the unclassified necessary too all of them being higher or uh higher at five and nine hours with the exception of rothia which was higher at five hours but not nine hours now nitrate exposure saliva exposing saliva to nitrate wasn't just uh there wasn't just an increase for nitro uh these three bacteria bacterial genera it also reduced quote-unquote bad bacteria at least bacteria that have been linked with caries and halitosis and more specifically each of these green arrows i had i had levels of i should say i was going to say relatively high but who knows how high is bad i had levels of these bacteria that have been linked with deficits in oral and or systemic health so note that for each of these bacteria streptococcus valenella poor porphyra feromondos um fuso bacteria and leptotricia after exposing the saliva nitrate each of them was significantly re reduced which is good because i want to reduce the quote-unquote bad bacteria while increasing the good ones now two other bacteria or bacterial genera that i had in my data that have been linked with uh oral and or systemic poor poor oral and or systemic health were tantarella and treponema and although they weren't significantly decreased after nitrate exposure note that the trend is downward so maybe it didn't work in these 12 subjects but maybe it could work for me but nonetheless there's enough positive data in this study with an increase of the nitrate reducing bacteria the quote unquote good oral health bacteria and a decrease in the cortical bad oral health bacteria so i think it's a good idea to increase nitrate as it means for optimizing my own oral microbiome so how can i increase oral nitrate now with the goal of optimizing oral bacterial composition since we see that a diet rich in nitrate will increase uh oral nitrate should i eat more nitrate containing foods well i'm already on a high nitrate diet now here are many foods that i eat in my diet and it isn't a comprehensive list it's missing things like collard greens which i eat a lot of but it's it's got most of the nitrate contained in my diet so we're looking at nitrate content of each of these foods in milligrams per hundred gram of food and then note that i track my diet every day uh i should say a shameless plug with chronometer and if you're interested in a chronometer discount link that will also be in the video's description so when looking at the the dietary period for my last blood test on may 9th through my last my my latest blood test on july 11th that period i have my average intake for each of these foods and then we can calculate the nitrate content that i'm eating from each of these foods on a daily basis the average for each of these foods on a daily basis by multiplying the nitrate concentration of these foods by my average intake so we've got my nitrate intake for all those foods and when we sum them we can see that my total nitrate intake per day on average is almost 1900 milligrams almost 2 grams of nitrate per day this is a high night relatively high nitrate diet so i it's going to be difficult for me to increase more beets i'm already eating 200 grams of beets per day and 200 grams of mushrooms per day 300 plus grams of carrots per day it's going to be tough to go further with nitrate-rich foods so as many of you know on this channel i generally don't supplement i try to get it all from food but i do support i do you know promote as a part of my approach targeted supplementation so this is a situation where i think adding potassium nitrate to my homemade mouthwash may have some benefit so then the question is how much nitrate and how often now note that this study was a in each in vitro study so whether the individual concentration that they used is something i should replicate is unknown and especially there aren't any published randomized controlled trials rcts that use a specific amount of nitrate to optimize the salivary microbiome so with that in mind i think a fair amount to use is 2 grams of potassium nitrate per 1000 milliliters this is a 32 millimolar concentration which is five times the concentration used in the in vitro study but again i have no idea uh this is just where i'm going to start i can always titrate it down or even titrate it up based on what my results will be in for future salivary micro microbiome experiments so next up then is how often should i use this mouthwash so here we're looking at salivary nitrate levels and conversion to nitrite after nitrate exposure in saliva so saliva that was exposed to nitrate how much nitrate was left in the sample after a period of time so immediately after exposing the saliva to nitrate we can see a big burst in the concentration of nitrate in the sample but then after five hours almost all of it was consumed probably by the nitrate reducing bacteria neseria and rothia and that after consuming it they convert it into nitrite as shown there there's a there's an increase in nitrite at the five hour point in conjunction with the decrease in nitrate at the five hour point and then after nine hours there's no more nitrate remaining in the sample so what does this mean this suggests that i should use the mouthwash once every five hours as most of the nitrate will be consumed after five hours and nine hours at the latest and then no rinse after using the mouthwash because if i use the mouthwash and then rinse i'm probably washing away all of the nitrate but also xylitol so i won't get that prebiotic effect for my salivary microbiome whereas if i have mouthwash and then spit whatever's left can be used as a prebiotic potentially to increase or increase the good quality good bacteria or reducing the chronic bad bacteria all right so then that raises some some questions will levels of nitrate reducing bacteria more specifically than naceria and raffia further increase and levels of those quote-unquote bad bacteria which are associated with a whole bunch of adverse health-related conditions will they decrease and to test that i'm going to again use bristol they sent me another kit so i'll re-test probably in less than a month i want to give my oral microbiome a chance to assimilate to the nitrate in my mouthwash i honestly i don't know how long to go it could be two weeks it could be a month but i think a month is a fair amount of time to do the experiment so yeah i'll use bristol and again that link will be in the video's description if you want to get a discount on your own oral microbiome so stay tuned for that video update that'll be coming sometime in the near future all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks
