# High Mushroom Intake, High Homocysteine?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Homosysteine increases during aging and that's what we'll see here on the y- ais we've got plasma levels of homosysteine plotted against age and this is from 12year olds all the way up to older than 80y olds in youth average homoy values for women and men are around 6 to 7 micromolar homosysteine then increases during aging such that at older ages older than 80 years old average homosysteine is 11 to 12 micromolar now the importance of that age related increase for homoy is that relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk or acm risk and that's what we'll see here this is a meta analysis of six studies that included almost 28,000 people on the y- axis we've got relative risk so this is risk of death for all causes plotted against circulating levels of homocysteine hcy in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one when the dashed black lines are completely above one as in this case cas or below one in other studies that's a significant association so we can see that even at very low levels of homosysteine all cause mortality risk or risk of death for all causes significantly increases as homosysteine increases even from values as low as 1 to2 micromolar so together these data suggest that lower is better for homosysteine and avoiding the age related increase may be important for minimizing risk of death for all causes now if you're familiar with the channel homeloan has been a weak spot as it's been close to age expected for many tests so with that in mind what's my data and let's take a look at that story so i first started tracking homosysteine in 2005 and over the past 20 years or so i have 41 blood tests as shown here homosysteine on the y- axis plotted against h so in my early to mid-30s average homosysteine was relatively youthful at 7.1 micromolar and then unfortunately i took about 10 years off for measuring it i just didn't i was measuring other stuff or i couldn't afford it at the time i don't remember why i i'd stopped measuring it but then around 6 years ago i started testing it adding it back into the approach as i realized this is important i better start measuring it again and over the past 6 years or so 35 tests average homosysteine has been 10.3 micromolar which is close to age expected which if you're familiar with the channel these are dirty words in my approach i don't want to be age expected for anything everything should be as close to youthful as possible now rather than just looking at uh two averages between two different periods when using a two sample t test these two groups of data are sign significantly different as that p value is less than 0.05 in other words i've had an age related increase for homosysteine so how can i reduce it how can i reduce homosysteine and i can already hear you in the comments saying just take tmg trimethyl glycine or betane that'll do the trick i've tried it but let's check out the data so in terms of being able to reduce homosysteine let's take a look at homosysteine metabolism which is shown here now homosysteine is in the middle and we can increase dietary intake of betane so foods contain betane like beets but other foods too now we can also supplement right we can take tmg try methyl glycine or otherwise known as betane and with the goal of reducing homoy because as you can see on this chart homosysteine combines with betane to form methionine also forming dimethyl glycine with a methyl group transfer from betane uh in the process thereby reducing circulating levels of homocysteine now this this is the theoretical for what can happen and i can say in my case i haven't made a youtube video about it but pre youtube i had a blog and i documented the biohacking journey on the blog and one of those uh experiments was 4 grams per day of trimethyl glycine it didn't make a dent on homine and i'll link i'll link to that blog post from years before the youtube channel existed i'll link to that in the video's description now there are other ways we can potentially reduce homosysteine and that includes by increasing dietary intake of folic acid which increases serum folate in conjunction with vitamin b12 converts homosysteine into methionine now again rather than focus focusing on what can happen remember i track my diet every day weighing all my food logging it into chronometer putting it into an excel spreadsheet and then looking at correlations for diet with biomarkers after every test so i can look at correlations for folate b12 and other nutrients with homocysteine to see if they're making a dent potentially making a dent or at least correlated with them you know cuz we don't we can't say about causation but if they're not correlated i can't imagine they would be making it a causitive dent nonetheless folate in my data 35 tests for foliate intake lined up with homocystine not significally correlated you can see that p value is greater than 0.05 so it's at 0.113 granted the correlation is in the right direction but it's outside of significance in contrast vitamin b12 is significantly correlated with lower homoy in my data as you can see that the r the correlation coefficient is ne 0.54 so in other words a relatively higher intake of vitamin b12 is significantly correlated with lower homosysteine that's what that correlation suggests and the p value is far below 0.05 at 0.009 so that's an easy answer right just supplement with v uh vitamin b12 or methyl b12 which is what which was what i was doing up to 1,000 microgr or 1 milligram per day just take highd do methyl b12 problem solved right well the goal isn't to just optimize one biomarker and then make others worse first the the the challenge is actually investigating if there's a correlative impact on other biomarkers and i do that after every test and when running that analysis the net correlative score for vi vitamin b12 intake is minus 3 in other words a relatively higher intake of vitamin b12 in my data is significant correlated with lower homocysteine but it's also significant correlated with four other biomarkers going in the wrong direction in terms of how they change during aging or their association with all cause mortality risk so i'm not interested in improving one biomarker and potentially making four others worse and again notice i say potentially because these are correlations and i can say about causation i have tried lower doses of vitamin b12 uh 500 micrograms per day 300 micrograms per day but those don't make a dent on homosysteine so it seems like it's either go high you know 1,000 microgram per day for vitamin b12 potentially mess up other bi markers or get no effect so vitamin b12 is kind of a a no-o for me at this point there are other ways though potentially to reduce homoy though and those include the amino acid serene in combination with vitamin b6 as they help convert homosysteine into cystathionine and then in the presence of adequate b6 cystathionine is converted coned into cysteine which is potentially important because cysteine can be incorporated into gsh or glutathione both cysteine and glutathione declin during aging so i spent a few tests trying to increase or i increase seran intake up to six gram per day while trying to drag drag homocysteine towards this pathway rather rather than going towards methionine which may be bad for you know longevity based on methionine restriction studies but nonetheless high dose serene up to 6 gam per day didn't make a dent on homocysteine more specifically vitamin b6 is not significally correlated with homosysteine in my data as shown there p value greater than 0.05 what about increasing intake of other methyl donor so betane or trimethyl glycine that means that the nitrogen atom on glycine the amino acid glycine has three methyl groups but that's not the only amino acid that has three methyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom others include proline betane and tryptophan betane and also as a potential methyl donor although it's not an amino acid trigonelline which is otherwise known as one methyl nicotinic acid can also potentially act as a methyl donor so i i've experimented with increasing intake of each of these potential methyl donors with no impact on homosysteine so it would seem i'm out of luck right well for whatever reason i had the thought maybe something in my diet is causing higher homosysteine so what could that be maybe mushrooms so mushrooms are a great source of ergine and spermine and that's important because both of those metabolites increase lifespan in mice so with that in mind i've been keeping mushroom intake relatively high with an average of about 250 gram per day for many tests but also note that mushrooms also contain nicotinamide and i know that because if they contain nicotinic acid i'd expect my ned levels to be on the higher side not age expected or lower so that suggests that the niin that's contained in mushrooms is most likely nicotinamide so why is that important nicotinamide increases homocysteine and this isn't a randomized control trial this is a human study plasma levels of homosysteine were measured up to 3 hours after people were dosed with nicotinamide and then as we'll see in a minute uh nicotinic acid or water as a control so when people took 300 mig of nicotinamide an hour and a half after that homosysteine levels plasma levels of homocysteine increased from micromolar to 16 and 3 hours later we're up to 18 micromolar it's a pretty big jump that's in comparison with water as a control where you can see that there was no change in plasma levels of homos cyan and then fortunately in this study they also tried nicotinic acid same dose 300 mig uh 300 milligram dose and although you can see that there was a small increase for homocysteine it was only up to from about 11 to 12 micromolar and nowhere near as close to the increase for homosysteine as nicotinamide now also as another side note note that most of us in this community are taking nicotinic acid or nicotinamide with the goal of increasing nad in my case a far lower dose of nicotinic acid increases nad as low as 50 milligrams per day gets the same ned raising effect as 300 milligrams of nicotinamide so that that suggests that i may not get any increase for homosysteine at that relatively lower dose of nicotinamide while getting an nad boost so now we can return to to our question and see is mushroom intake related to homoy i we can more directly assess that as i track diet in conjunction with biomarkers and i have 27 tests where diet lines up with homosysteine as i've been tracking food intake since 2018 and that's what we can see here with plasma levels of homocysteine on the y axis plotted against the average daily mushroom intake on the x and then we can see a significant positive strong correlation strong being defined as a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 so here we've got 0.72 so a significant positive strong correlation between mushroom intake with homocystine in other words when my mushroom intake has been at its highest level that's significantly correlated with higher levels of homosysteine so is mushroom intake related to homosysteine we can see with that check it is now to test that correlation i then cut a mushroom intake from test number four to test number five from 250 gam per day to 2 95 g per day and you can see that data point it looks like an outlier that that green line is no other no other homosysteine data in conjunction with mushroom intake has been in that ballpark in other words this looks like an outlier relative to all my other mushroom intake as it's lower but also note that that 8.9 micro that corresponds to this test where i cut mushroom intake is in the same ballpark as the data on the right which i was able to obtain and these are relatively lower values on average compared to the mushroom intake values on the right i was only able to obtain the lower hyting values on the left with high dose greater than 500 micrograms per day of vitamin b12 and mushrooms for those tests were zero so what the mushroom cut from 250 to 95 gram per day suggests is that i might be able to get in the ballpark of a homocyst reduction as if i'm taking methyl donors although i was not supplementing with any methyl donors for this test now there is a potential compounder to the story and it involves protein intake because as shown there protein intake in my data is significantly correlated with lower homosysteine in other words when protein intake has been higher homocysteine has been lower correlation now for this test protein intake was increased by about 15 gam per day so is it the mushroom cut and lower nicotinamide that made a dent is it the higher protein intake that made a dent i don't know both of those may be involved so to test that for the next test the i've cut protein intake down from the 112 gram per day where it was on average for test number five to back to 95 to 100 g per day where it was prior to test number five and i've kept mushrooms at 95 gram per day so by bringing protein intake down if homocysteine stays at 9 micromolar or less that would suggest that it might have been the mushrooms and too much nicomide that was increasing my homosysteine all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of affiliate and discount
