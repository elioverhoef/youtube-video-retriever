# Which Gut Bacteria Are Associated With Poor Health, And How Can We Limit Them?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The gut microbiome affects the health and function of many organ systems positive effects include a basic role in digestion providing nutrients to the host including vitamin production and then degrading foreign metabolites which is known as xenobiotic degradation now the gut microbiome also impacts the immune system immune system maturation and function and then interestingly note there's a picture of muscle there so it also impacts the gut muscle axis uh so if you're interested in that i'll leave a link to that in the right corner uh so positive effects for the gut microbiome also include brain development and behavior and then protection and clearance from pathogen invasion however the gut microbiome can negatively affect us including the obvious which would be intestinal related issues including colon cancer development and gastrointestinal disorders but then note uh there are extra intestinal so outside of the intestinal effects on health including metabolic syndrome diabetes and obesity and it can contribute to chronic kidney disease so with all of this in mind uh which gut bacteria are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and when we know that with the goal of optimizing health and potential potentially longevity how can we limit levels of those bacteria so getting right into it higher gut microbiome levels of anterior bacteria ca and i'll call them enterobacteria for short are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so uh just to dissect this data so we've got cause of death on the left the number of deaths the hazard ratio and then the fdr which is the false discovery rate as the measure of statistical significance so first when looking at all-cause mortality we can see that relatively higher levels of anterobacteria are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when looking at the data on the right for the hazard ratio where the horizontal lines which is the confidence interval if they're both greater than one uh then that's a statistically significant effect which is what we see here now obviously because enterobacteria are located in the intestine we can see an increased uh risk of death for gastrointestinal or yeah an increased risk of death related to gastrointestinal issues uh as shown there but then also notice there's an increase in cancer so relatively higher levels of anterior bacteria higher risk of death from cancer now they didn't specify in the paper if that was gastrointestinal only cancer but this is total cancer and then interestingly uh and suggestive of a gut lung axis uh higher levels of gut levels of anterior bacteria were associated with an increased risk of death from respiratory related issues and i also have a video related to that uh more specifically pneumonia and viral infection and the link between the gut microbiome for that so if you're interested in that i'll leave a link also in the right corner now um outcomes that were not associated with all-cause mortality risk in terms of enterobacteria levels were cardiovascular deaths neurological deaths and other now as a double whammy here not only our enterobacteria relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk they increased during aging and there weren't any pretty pictures to show from this uh from this study so i just uh you know took a screenshot of the main finding from this paper and they found that enterobacteria were 1.7 fold higher in older adults that were about an average age of 75 years when compared with a younger subject so 35 years so the increase during aging and having higher levels relatively higher levels is associated with an all-cause mortality risk so now that we know that how can we limit gut microbiome levels of enterobacteria so uh as as i as the title gives away the uh the main point enterobacter and pterobacteria levels are limited in the presence of short chain fatty acids scfas so what are short chain fatty acids so uh dietary fiber and uh dietary fiber is comprised of insoluble which is mostly not fermented by gut bacteria and soluble fiber which is converted by got microbiota or gut bacteria into the short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate as shown there now as the title says enterobacteria levels are limited in the presence of scfas so let's see that data and that's that's what's shown here and there's a lot to unpack here so i'm going to dissect it bit by bit so that we can all have a proper understanding of it so the young mice uh so these were about two months old so that's very young for a mice were treated with antibiotics and then colonized with three different bacterial species klebsiella pneumonia pneumoniae e coli uh or proteus mirabilis and that's what the blue circles triangles and diamonds are showing so why did they pick these bacteria so klebsiella pneumoniae and e coli are enterobacteria they're bacterial species in the enterobacteria family and that's what's uh shown here so you can see that the family for both uh the klebsiella pneumoniae and e coli are enterobacteria so what about proteus mirabilis so you can see that the family is not anterobacteria but they were previously classified as enterobacteria at the time of publication for the data on the previous slide proteus mirabilis were anterobacteria classified as enterobacteria but that bacterial family uh that the proteus mirabilis are found in was reclassified to uh and i may butcher the name but uh morgan morgan ella ca so probably butchered the name but anyway so that's a sister family uh that is closely closely related to anterobacteria so okay going back to our data here so uh as a metric of how much of uh of these enterobacteria were found in the mice after colonization they looked at cf cfu which are colony phony colony forming units per gram and then they measured uh levels of short chain fatty acids in the cecum so i just want to take another side step here so why the cecum so the cecum is uh the beginning of the large intestine and it's where the small intestine ends so why why did they pick uh why did they look at short chain fatty acid content in the cecum versus other parts of the colon the ascending colon transverse colon descending colon the the sigmoid colon and or the rectum so the cecum contains the highest amounts of the short chain fatty acids in the large intestine so just looking at just looking at the small intestine the jejunum and ilium we can see that there are very low levels of short chain fatty acids which is indicated on the y-axis but then when we look at the short chain fatty acid levels in the sequin we could see relatively uh high levels or actually the highest levels on this on this chart and then as we progress through the colon we can see that the short chain fatty acid levels decrease as we go all the way through so ascending to transverse uh descending sigmoid colon and then through the rectum the short chain fatty acid levels decrease along each length relative to the levels in the cecum so they were looking to maximize short chain fatty acid production because these are very hard uh short chain fatty acids to measure they are metabolized very quickly so you want to go after where they're found in the highest amounts which is in the cecum all right so back to our data so first we can see that those mice that were colonized with enterobacteria had had uh very high levels or the highest levels of enterobacteria you know 10 to the 10th colony 40 colony forming units per gram all right and then half of those half of those mice were uh divided into well the mice were divided into two groups so one group was uh then uh force-fed uh pbs which is phosphate buffer buffered saline which may have had the effect of washing away some of these bacteria and also by doing that it may have allowed for the growth of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria because we can see that now there's there's a reduction in these enterobacteria relative to the blue and short chain fatty acid levels are higher almost almost double now the other half of those mice that were colonized with enterobacteria initially were then force-fed or uh gavaged uh with uh feces so this is a fecal transplant a fecal microbiota transplant fmt uh from using feces from normal mice that were not treated with antibiotics and that effect ended up reducing levels of the anterior bacteria to almost close to the limit of detection lod and then we can see all of the green uh the circles of triangles and diamonds we can see that short chain fatty acid levels are now close to 30 and as high as 70 millimolar so also last but not least on this on this graph in the in these data we can see a correlation so that strong correlation of negative 0.81 is for the correlation between the levels of enterobacteria and the mice that were treated with pbs or that had the fecal transplant versus short chain fatty acid levels so what we can see is there's a strong inverse correlation the higher the short chain fatty acid levels the lower the levels of these anterior bacteria so just taking it back to the title of the slide from that we can conclude that enterobacterial levels are limited in the presence of short-chain fatty acids and there's a caveat to this but short-chain fatty acid levels decrease during aging and that's what's shown here and this is human data so when looking at four different age groups younger than 50 years old 50 to 65 years old 66 to 80 years old and older than 80 for each of the short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate we can see at least or close to a 50 reduction looking at the youngest group younger than 50 versus older than 80. So acetate 49 millimolar to about 19 millimolar so more than 50 reduction propionate 16 millimolar in the younger youngest group to eight millimolar and the older than 80. So 50 reduction there and then approaching a 50 reduction for butyrate the youngest versus the oldest group and then the total short-chain fatty acids there's clearly uh uh more than half uh uh short-chain fatty acid levels in the older adult more older than 80 compared to the younger than 50 year-olds so uh aging from this we can conclude that aging is characterized by lower levels of short-chain fatty acids and higher enterobacteria so with the goal of reducing enterobacteria and all-cause mortality risk the main focus should be how can we increase short-chain fatty acid levels now i've already gone through that and a major reason a major way to do that is by having a high soluble fiber diet so that should maximize gut bacterial short-chain fatty acid production and that would then would be expected to potentially limit anterobacteria levels now however there are no randomized controlled trials rcts in older adults that have tested this hypothesis and if anybody's come across studies where a high soluble fiber diet was given to older adults so older than 60 years and they looked at changes for short-chain fatty acids or enterobacteria please leave a comment in the uh and you know leave a comment below because i haven't come across it so what about other interventions is just uh is it just a high soluble fiber diet that can uh affect short-chain fatty acids and potentially anti-enterobacteria and all cause mortality risk or their other interventions so another way to increase your fatty acids is with exercise training so in this study and it's a relatively small study of 32 people that were previously sedentary so they were uh relatively young so 20 to 45 year olds and this was a six week study that used three times a week of endurance exercise uh and so they looked at before uh before training and after training so e0 versus e6 and what we can see for each of these short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate we can see significant increases for the circles which were lean subjects that had a bmi less than 25. However uh uh people that were obese in this studies that had a bmi greater than 30 they did not see exercise training did not impact short chain fatty acid levels and that's potentially a topic for another video uh actually the why behind that i mean it's a big mystery uh in in the gut microbiome field so if anybody's got some ideas why that would be true or some papers uh please also leave a comment uh you know let's get a good discussion going around that all right so related to this uh you know this these data in terms of exercise training increasing short chain fatty acids similarly professional athletes and in this case it was professional rugby players they have higher levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids so higher levels of the short-chain fatty acids in poop versus non-athletes and we can see that for each of these short-chain fatty acids acetate propane and butyrate the gray bars for the rugby players versus the non-rugby players in green so with this in mind then are there exercise training rcts that have measured the effect on uh short-chain fatty acids and levels of enterobacteria in older adults again older than 60 and unfortunately that there are no studies yet i haven't come across any uh a study was just recently published that they they looked at uh short chain fatty acid levels and exercise training but this was in a uh a group that was approaching 60 but in terms of using exercise training uh or even a high soluble fiber diet and people older than 60 as far as i know there are no studies that have investigated yet especially with the goal of reducing enterobacteria levels all right that's all all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed the video as you can see on this slide there are lots of ways to find find me online have a great day
