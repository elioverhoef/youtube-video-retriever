Hey everybody welcome back to the channel today we've got chrisman lumis for round two uh if you miss round one it'll be in the video's description chrisman is the owner and operator of unaging un aging.com so today we're going to talk about a whole bunch of aging related topics so let's jump into it so what's on the agenda today chris so uh first uh you're going to talk about a diet life expectancy study then i thought be a good idea for us to talk about supplements um and kind of what we think about them there's a lot of youtube videos out there of what everyone's taking and i want to make sure that you and i put in our two cents worth on it and then on healthy habits like once you get beyond diet and exercise what else is that that you can do that would make a difference all right so i i'll link to this paper in the video's description but uh and i don't even have the title here but i think it's impact of healthy lifestyle factors on life expectancies and then i i can't see what the rest is all right but nonetheless gained life expectancy by increasing and then a variety of factors physical activity smoking diet quality um moderate alcohol consumption and then uh bmi so in focusing on diet people who are in the highest um was it cortile or quintile of uh the alternative healthy eating index women and men so you can see that women who are in the highest quintile compared to the lowest had about a a fouryear gain of life expectancy for the highest dietary quality and then for men it's um actually sorry it's five-year gain for women because it's compared to q1 which is the reference and then for men it was a four-year gain so that might not seem too impressive but then there is another study that was just published so you can see you can see here life expectancy can increase by up to 10 years following sustained shifts towards healthier diets so when it comes to pushing that and and that that's you know they don't have any pretty pictures i mean they've got uh you know like uh they ranked want them to rank they looked at hazard ratio all cause mortality based on individual food groups uh and this is actually the um so they have the in the supplementary data they have a i don't remember off the top of my head in terms of um what they adjusted for i think this one isn't fully adjusted when you look at the fully adjusted data it's actually cleaner so i don't know maybe i'll share that one too because i have that open so the what i'm finding is that the adjustment for as many variables as possible is the essential in these epidemiological studies and i know that may seem superficially obvious but most epi studies like for example using ldl as an example they'll adjust for you know the standards age sex bmi education um and then like hypertension um glucose levels you know basically metabolic health but then not all of these studies whether it's ldl or this study or others they won't adjust for all of the comorbidities many of these studies will leave out like deaths from lung disease or um liver liver disease and maybe that doesn't seem like a big deal but reverse causation is a big or potentially a big impact on a lot of these associations so like in the case i mean i guess we won't go through the ldl story today but there's a study that was recently published with about 5 million people where they adjusted for like 14 different comorbidities and when you look at earlier studies that show basically a j-shaped or u-shaped curve for ldl in all cause mortality or total cholesterol with ldl driving most of that when you adjust for all of the comorbidities as opposed to some of them the the curve becomes like uh you know the it flattens out the bottom of that j so that lower ldl is not associated or lower total clol is not associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk so anyway with with that in mind the paper uh in the supplementary data for the diet life expectancy uh study the 10 years this is the more fully adjusted model bmi calories or energy age sex you know and and the full spectrum which reduces their sample size because i think it was probably double or triple this in the in the larger set but nonetheless they go through all of the different food groups and in terms of the longest um reduced all cause mortality risk versus uh uh you know better survival shorter and it's actually some of it is is you know uh what you'd expect like you know what's interesting is not that i'm a pro meat guy i'm not anti meat but if you look at sugar sweetened beverages in terms of uh you know all cause mortality risk i mean it's 65% higher risk significantly you can see the confidence interval is greater than one and i mean you know processed meat too i mean peter aa is high on his processed meat and yet 45% and these are the strongest associations with now granted the process meat he's eating i guess probably has no preservatives and i i don't know you know how uh you know their what natural flavors they're using but um nonetheless the two strongest associations are processed meat and you know the sugar sweetened beverages you know whereas um red meat red meat not significant confidence interval overlaps um white meat not significant and again i'm not pro or anti- meat this is just what the data shows but yet in in pop culture you know there isn't this big drive for hey let's let's tax sugar sweeten beverages or let's reduce intake because now i'm going to sound like the conspiracy theorist but you've got big food right big food who doesn't want right so so anyway 10year increased life expectancy with this study too so if we're going to make a dent on pushing that you know average life expectancy out we've got one study showing four to six years for you know women and men uh this study showing 10 years uh but then the question is you know with the biomarker based approach can we push it out 15 to 20 add cr in there add some circadian alignment in there in terms of when you eat uh and a little bit of fasting potentially based on the animal studies maybe push it out to 25 or 30 i don't know what the window is but yeah i just wanted to this will probably be in a video at some point but uh yeah this is the hot off the presses um so just going over it now like some of the things that jump out um like one is the the nuts at4 it looks like it didn't reach significance so it's a bit questionable but the average result was the largest thing on there as i've talked i think about before and i've noted from the epidemiological studies the nuts dosage is very sensitive um so basically getting just what they say here is getting about uh one small handful or but less than an ounce like almost an ounce a day is the best and you see this here my statistical analysis of it from another study says it's a 17% reduction ction in premature death and you see here in quintile 2 it's 18% right on and significant at that level um that one matches expectations sugar sweeten beverages matches expectation the meat white is one that's kind of strange right like some of these things have strange intermediate results but um then again you see with the legumes then being healthy generally but kind of questionable fish also being sort of borderline which is something i usually think is good but one of the interesting ones that stands out here also is the milk being actually generally healthy is another one that's a bit of a surprise especially as you get into the higher amounts usually i see that is not healthy that might be idiosyncratic this is a uk study um so that might be something that kind of depends on the uk um but in general i think it lines up it'd be um uh yeah it's something that uh i'll be interested to take a look after this and kind of see how it matches with the uh the data that we have today you've got the refined grains too which i mean across the board you can see q2 significant q3 q4 every every quintile of higher intake is significant associated with increased alause mortality risk so um yeah not i mean but that's easy right you know that's for me that's the lowest hanging fruit eat real food and exercise right that that's you know it's it's not specific enough and like like you were saying about the nuts where you know you've got q2 being significant whereas the higher intakes are not um you know it gets to this idea of again specificity like if you look at q5 okay sure that confidence interval going um you know overlapping with one but when you see so so it raises an interesting thing that that the hazard ratio is so low it suggests but the confidence interval was so high is that there was a lot of variability within nut intake and all cause mortality risk but on the one hand and again i know it's not significant so this is speculation but it suggests that for a given population there may be factors where the highest quintile of intake is indeed associated with the largest uh risk reduction whereas for whatever reason people who are eating the most nuts um there's some variability in that so for me it's a matter of you know how can you hitrate what are the variables and this kind of ties into the alcohol story too because there's a similar effect going on here also with with the uh hazard ratio potentially suggesting a decreased mortality risk at lower intakes but it overlaps with one but it suggests that there may be subpopulations of people and again it's not significant so it's just a suggestion it s suggests that there are subpopulations of people that if you figure out what the external variables or the other variables are in addition to this that can impact risk to make it a significant thing there may be a you know an even bigger benefit right but um what those other factors are i can't i can't say it have to do deep dive right so well i mean off the off the top of the head the the tradeoff of nuts is the high calorie cont to them right so then you might be seeing some people who are then eating far too many nuts um my dad often talked about one of his weaknesses was the jar of peanut butter on the counter that he'd come home after eating a tight calorie day and then get a big old glob of peanut butter cuz he was just hungry yeah um so i think that's probably going to be what you're seeing on the top side the argument against that those they adjusted the model for energy intake so um but it could be lots of bmi as well right yeah so even even eggs here too occasional eggs q2 significant reduction uh and then you can see even q3 and q4 right on that borderline of a little bit of eggs uh potentially being good uh but then you q5 highest i mean now it's significant too many eggs not good right so that that matches up exactly with the epidemia olical study i've seen to date where it says that on the dosage of about an egg every other day or so is fine and might even be slightly good for you and this in fact shows that the q2 is better for you than being at the lowest egg consumption but after about an egg a day then from that it's basically break even and after that now you're starting to see other effects and that's probably going to be the cholesterol right yeah it could be but so i mean granted i'm the outlier and the n of one right but so i i increase egg intake from two per week to four per week and it didn't didn't affect anything no biomarkers nothing changed so that's the sweet spot four per week you're about every other day so that's exactly in the q2 that's where i'm saying people actually did see benefit from it right but you'd expect if that were true in my case you'd expect to see some biomarkers with some you know uh just some improvement moving the needle in some direction and nothing literally nothing nothing okay it had no huh yeah so but that goes back back to the context dependent you know it could be and no effect obviously clearly no effect on my total or ldl cholesterol levels in my case i've got to really jack up my saturated fat whether it's from coconut butter or other stuff kaca beans which is saturated fat too to get my hdl from it's or sorry for my ldl and total cholesterol from relatively low 150 and like 80 for total and ldl to get that to like 180 200 uh so it seems that eggs on the context of my you know high fiber diet no moving the needle on cholesterol but for the average person who's probably eating 15 grams of fiber per day because there's an inverse association between fiber and total cholesterol level so if you're on a low fiber diet relatively and you go to more and more eggs and i know people are going to say well uh the idea that increasing dietary cholesterol doesn't impact blood cholesterol has been debunk but for some people it that may not be the case where there is a you know a do response relationship depending on the background of other stuff that you're eating like i said including things like fiber so that could be some of the story here but speculation right i don't know right i'm not i'm not sure exactly on the color coding they're using for this cuz like i look at whole grain's q3 and it's like 82% and it's clearly under one so it's a significant benefit but then i look at ve vegetables q4 and it's also green but it clearly straddles one so i'm not not quite clear how they did the coloring yeah i agree the color coding here is a disaster like even the blu the blue are their their eat well recommendations the uk eat well recommendations which just okay yeah and then yeah i don't i don't like you said i don't know why the green would you because yeah whole grains q2 and q4 are significant so why aren't those also green right so yeah screwy that's one reason i didn't show this in a video because you know it's just there is some confusion to it right so but if you look at it though another interesting thing that is consistent with the epd demiological studies is that the vegetables and fruits and vegetables don't have that big of a boost overall i mean if you look at for instance even just having the q2 quartile second quartile of nuts which gave you the 18% reduction in all cause none of the quartiles for fruits or vegetables give you anywhere more than 10% reduction in all cause mortality yeah to to play the devil's advocate there um i don't know if it's because of bias or the published studies or publish studies drive my bias but most people are barely eating any fruits and vegetables so we're talking about associations for maybe five maybe five total servings per day versus one or two which to me is like you know comparing sick against sicker uh i have i have another i didn't open this tab up but there's a another study on um fiber intake and all cause mortality risk and off the top of my head i have to take another look at it but i think um fruit fiber wasn't significantly associated with reduced risk which ties into what this data shows and what you're saying but vegetable fiber was but again that's still on the lowest side of fiber intake and i think the highest fiber in that study was like 40 grams like how i'm completely i'm double that at least how do how do you put me into that context right so right well i i focus on the fiber getting it from the whole grains and the legumes the whole grains as we've seen have uh come out strong here they're basically one or below in every quartile after the first and the legumes though that's a mystery one like it think i think we're talking about the rarity thing like the quintile 5 how much legumes are they actually eating but that range there is the largest almost of any of the ranges like hazard ratio from 10% to 525 per is yeah not clear but those are the those are the real drivers i think for most people of fiber in the diet is the whole grains and legumes um it's hard to eat enough fruits and vegetables to get enough fiber before before your stomach is full um uh i know not everyone is able to put away half a kilo of strawberries like like you can yeah um it's the the legumes is where i've been focusing and also on the whole grains because i find that's very underappreciated getting like a slice of whole wheat bread is actually a wonderful healthy thing um feels like we kind of forget about it in the the rush towards uh whole foods it doesn't look like a food but it really is or or some healthy breakfast cereals also can be outstand not the fro loops grant you but like the cheerios or um grape nuts or some of those other things or oatmeal can be excellent healthy foods uh but the argument there for at least someone like me is those foods don't satiate me at all and and it's they are processed like it's not it's not ultr processed but you know like uh instead of so if you've got a cereal that's derived from whole wheat and it's quote unquote whole grain ideally you can buy whole wheat berries you just cook them up you just put them in whatever you're cooking and you just put a the an equivalent amount of c so instead of having a slice of bread which is like four bites and 100 calories um you put that well granted whole wheat berries are still calorie dense you know whole grains are about 100 calories an ounce but um at least you're getting legit the whole food versus you know whatever the whole grains 12 grains of whole grains and cheerios right i mean literally eat the whole grain you know but most doing that most people aren't doing that right well i'm a big fan of the whole wheat berries as well i have those every morning whole wheat berries barley and oatmeal is my standard bowl so nice um but uh i actually go and and recommend to people some and myself as well just a granola bar hyper processed added sugar all of those things but at least it is whole wheat and the fiber there is quite high yeah no i hear you i hear you on that i don't know i can put it back up but but so the yeah that for me that's like the general you know the general recommendation versus the i don't want to say the mic level which is you know uh eat real food i just i see you know even the store bought granola granola bars uh are you know just that they can be not satiating right so it's how many of those are you going to eat can you just stick with one that one little strip or what i learned a long time ago was you know what if i make my own right and for me infinitely more satiating like uh not necessarily um first of all the oats being rolled oats you know is is it uh you know so there's a difference like quakers quakers rolled oats versus like steel cut oats glycemic index there's difference um pesticide use like there's a there's a i think it's a consumer reports or some some website did a a review on pesticides and oatmeal in the rolled oats and uh i mean the burden in most rolled oats brands of pesticides i mean it was incredibly high even for some of the organic brands so um so it's important to know which on the list have no pesticides you know and you know i can hear people saying well so what pesticides uh conventional versus organic the nutrient quality is not different short that is you know there's data showing that but i'm trying to limit you know stuff like pesticides if i can um whether that makes it dent or not i take the gamble but from from my experience the the the bars that you're getting i mean just not satiating and when i make it at home it's like you know i i have cocoa beans in the dates which i make that homemade chocolate you know and that satiates me to the point where i don't i mean granted i could probably crush 4,000 calories of reese peanut butter cups but knowing that i'm eating the real food um you know it it satisfies that urge versus you know that i can't who can stop eating you know even granola bars right so well that's um one key to that i find is not to have too many there was a time when i was eating um i had a high supply of uh gran of protein bars and i found that basically the amount of them that i would eat in one sitting was largely determined by the variety of flavors i had because i would just take one of every flavor if i had two flavors i'd have two if i had five flavors i need five um so i currently have two kinds of granola bars so i usually eat two granola bars you're on the marathon you know you're on that marathon training diet so it's like you need calories you need quick calories um so yeah one thing i want to come back around to um i hadn't seen that uh consumer reports on the oatmeal i had seen the consumer reports on um some of the problems with rice um and heavy metals and some of the things but i haven't seen the oatmeal from the stuff that i had looked at before actually both legums and whole wheat whole grains were significantly better on having a very low pesticide burden compared with fruits and vegetables and uh there was a study that came out i believe it was in the last few years that talked about the high pesticide residue um fruits and vegetables versus the low pesticide residue and they found very significantly that the high pesticide residue this is about a third of all the the um total intake um had more of a j shape in terms of the all cause premature death reduction and my feeling instinct and uh have no evidence for this is that that's because the low dosage it doesn't matter but they were then showing higher cancer rates as people had higher doses of high pesticide residue fruits and vegetables and i think that's one of the main reasons why when we looked at the other pages you talk about like five servings should be normal for fruits and vegetables but we don't actually see that much of a benefit um because i don't think many people are able to get organic um it's easy for those of us who are of the means to shop at whole whole paycheck whole foods every day to think oh well of course it's all organic but anytime you're going out and eating at someone else's house or a restaurant or anywhere other than your home where you have had the luxury perhaps of paying a premium for the organic food it's not something you can count on which is another reason why i tend to go towards the whole grains and the beans which just naturally don't have as much pesticides with them so that's a good point uh you'll have to if you could send uh the pesticide and the mortality data that would be great but so it might not be consumer reports but it's something similar to that where they did an analysis of the pesticides so we can post that too in the in the video description okay cool great so uh shall we jump then into h supplements sure okay i this is a kind of a fast comment um i mean i as i scroll uh do my own scrolling through youtube and see sort of all the the health and nutrition experts there's always the question of what nutrients do you take um and i recently wrote a post on brian johnson and his blueprint and brian johnson takes over 100 supplements every day um and as i look at that my general feeling for that is uh i want to catch all the um the easy to achieve gains through normal lifestyle through eating the the whole grains and legumes and a small handful of nuts first and because my benchmark for everything is premature reduc ring premature death and reducing that risk for so many of these new things i have no idea there's no volume that we could get a study for that would tell me whether it actually reduces premature death and my confidence in saying okay well they've taken a study of this particular supplement or this chemical um the the joke that i make on the blog that i talk about is it's hard to tell the difference between some of the supplements in the name of pokemon like guestin torine and other things and they don't whether that has a particular impact whether it's actually reducing all cause mortality or just moving a particular biomarker perhaps in a unhelpful way or something that doesn't really make an impact as hard for me to see so the only supplement that i take on a daily basis is glucosamin glucosamin condroitin which is a knee medicine that's been around for decades but it's commonly prescribed and as a result and it's another uk study from the biobank in the uk they can show that it has about 15% reduction and all cause mortality and it seems to be clustered more around lung diseases um sort of copd and pneumonia and other kinds of things so that reduction just from taking a little completely harmless with no side effects of any kind medicine is going to give you a better overall result in reduction of premature death than maybe even getting uh restaurant ve fruits and vegetables that might have other things with them so for the other things like the the uh sort of the the supplements of the day when you're talking about metformin which is a diabetes supplement repy which targets mtor these are strong medicines but they're strong medicines they're prescription only at this point um so even if you ignore the overhead of trying to get something that is requires a doctor's prescription in the united states at least they do have side effects with them uh the rapy then is going to reduce muscle building so you need to then cycle it and other things and i've seen some studies that seem to say yes it's very beneficial for people who have diabetes it's a diabetes medicine but if you don't have diabetes you're not going to get the benefit of that and it's not really clear and even if they did they're saying that maybe it's like a five or 10% reduction premature death which i'm saying i've already got glucosamin as a suppl which does a 15% reduction so i'm going to stick with that but i am interested in the nmn which is coming up as a new thing and i know that you've been doing a lot of experimentation with the nad so uh with that i want to pass it over to you and hear what your thoughts are on supplement and also are your specific experiments of hacking your own nad production all right wait but before then uh so we can hopefully you can send the glucosamine data and there may actually be some data that it extends lifespan and mice i i could be wrong about that but uh so we can put that in the in the you know in the video description too so in terms of like what the billion supplements that brian's taking um he unlike i i hear your point about all cause mortality data and extrapolating from the animal studies i get that but in his defense he's he's tracking biomarkers right he's doing it rigorously and he's doing it the right way to see does it make a dent does it make it not but i don't think he has the appropriate control which is what does my data look like at my current you know he he he he can't start with the pre- blueprint phase brian data of this is what all my data was and i was my body composition was worse and all of all of those things my diet his diet was worse no supplements maybe um i don't know if he's comparing himself against that but um to take everything like you know met foran i mean trt he's on that forin he's on i think he may be on a statin which makes me think dude does anything in your body work normally without without these things like you know do you have you're literally catching the dam like you got so many holes whether whatever the situation may be um so that's one the other side of that though is like i said he's monitoring b biomarkers now i don't know though what's the magnitude of the effect by taking that stuff out i don't know if he's done that experiment how which things are actually making a dent and you know what's the consequence of long-term usage of these things where maybe some of the damage could be irreversible i don't know maybe and again i'm speculating there's no n of one longitudinal data or even animal studies that have done this well i don't know animal studies but okay rap a mice and it'll extend lifespan and sedentary mice in a cage you know um granted not to the magnitude of cr plus fasting plus circadian alignment but you know if if you take that okay if you take that in the short term and you get a transient improvement in biomarkers and that's a big if what's the chronic effect of doing that for 30 years like and if there are things in your in your biomarkers that change that may be even more difficult to change because youve taking you're taking something in a super physiological dose that you've never you would never see this in the wild are there some negative effects now maybe the answer is no and i'm wrong which is fine i'm happy to be wrong about that but on these things you know i i don't want i don't want my existence to cease to exist because i've taken some exogenous agent which i would never see and i basically for a lack of a better term effed myself with some prescription prescription meds i i try to take the lowest the lowest risk strategy and then you know add with the targeted supplementation on top top of that and then even then even with targeted supplementation which goes into the nad nmn nicotinic acid story um even with that i may take those things out that may have a an improvement in some areas but make other areas worse right with the goal of still changing it by diet so the the nad story is that um based on what quote unquote youthful is in blood cell blood cell ned levels which the common criticism there is you don't know what your tissue levels are which is a fair point but there are studies showing that an increase in blood nad can link with tissue levels of nad and we want to have it relatively high in the tissues we don't want to have low levels of muscle nad we'll have low levels of muscle energenics and so so on right so um but i am doing metabolomics data too to see to try to get more insight beyond the blood versus the tissue it's not a full picture we'd have to do muscle biopsies which is impractical so relatively low levels of nad 20 to 25 micromolar without supplementing anything and this is on my you know mostly youthful biomarker driven diet um and exercise training which is shown to increase ned still relatively low relative to 30y olds who have somewhere around 40 median values mine 20 to 25 without doing anything so i found that nicotinic acid works i started that experiment with 600 milligrams per day but on the same day it my doneen pace epigenetic pace of aging was like 10 standard deviations from my nine test average without that test suggesting i drove it into outlier status so then i shifted down 60 milligrams yeah yeah 10x reduction still got an increase for nad to the same magnitude is a th000 milligrams of nmn which the internet seems to love nmn and you know thinking it's the panacea of all things anti-aging 60 milligrams nicotin nicotinic acid same effect on ned as nmn 1 th000 milligrams so uh then i sent blood for uh n uh uh uh in terms of nad the the i then all right so wait so then so that's the low dose so then what about is is it a high nicotinic acid 600 milligrams per day and the corresponding high nad which was 67 micromolar on that day of the test with the worst unen pace is it high nicotinic acid is it high nad uh that's potentially messing up with the epigenetic pace of aging i don't know so to test that i then went with two grams per day of nmn and got my ned to 61 micromolar so then the question is all right if it's a high nad story the need and pace should be messed up i don't have that data yet i sent it should be coming on january 10th uh so waiting yeah still waiting not much longer but the the the pop you know the internet seems to think that it's going to be a highd do nicotinic acid uh story because if they need pace is around my usual you know8 78 76 somewhere in that range 82 um then it's not a high aned story it's a high nicotinic acid story um but the good news is nicotinic acid and lower doses 60 milligrams per day doesn't seem to mess up my duneden pace uh i think it was like 082 on that day which is in the ballpark of my which still is in6 like some of these guys like seam land uh and others which is the goal but uh so to get around that i've been on the trig tri trig it's hard to say trigonelline which i have a recent video about which potentially could increase nad and uh that's a dietary change so it would get around if i could increase nad and not mess up d and pace by increasing trigonelline through diet um that'd be a fantastic way to get around this whole nicotinic acid messing up d and pace in my case so what what's your what's your safest best bet for increasing nmn or nad right now with what you know hopefully hopefully triell hopefully triell okay yeah what's the dage uh it's probably about 20 milligrams per day from diet whereas before it was like zero almost like you know five milligrams and then you could say all right that's a 15 milligram per day difference is that going to make a dent but remember 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid raised my ned by you know 40% so so so what are the dietary ses of trigonelline again so you're going to like this one coffee is the most abundant source by far uh it's like 22 20 really yeah 2200 micrograms per gram but i think that's dry weight i've been telling you that's what i've been telling you should be drinking that coffee yeah i've been considering it more but it's a hard sell for me because uh coffee breath is just it's just rank for me i i just and you brush your teeth afterwards but it stays all day you know people if i'm around people that have drank uh drank coffee i'm like god just can't do it but so then second second on that list is um chickpeas which goes to legum story great there you go okay and the story gets better there too because i have food uh elevated iggs food sensitivities against many beans like uh kidney beans navy beans um actually navy beans have higher levels than chickpeas but my iggs are just way off the chart there um so and i was going to put that in a video you know the screenshots of the iggs and the beans but uh it would be a too long video so um anyway so chickp 350 350 micrograms per gram so i've actually taken so but then i've got to move around calories in my diet because i'm trying to stay uk caloric or less so barley and oats have significantly less trigonelline barley has almost none remains okay very good but so i'm substituting the all the whole grains for chickpeas uh to get that so uh whether that to make a dent and the people that have been you know saying where are the legumes blue zones and all cause mortality where is that in your data now we're going to see you know um so will it be enough i don't know but you know that's the well it's uh it's inspiring seeing you kind of pushing the levers and fine-tuning it so um just wish you could test that stuff faster yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah it'd be great to have that stuff uh you know in my you i could just do it immediately and have the answer like you know within days but some one can hope right that that's coming right okay maybe maybe the trigonelline doesn't make a dent at all and then i just have to go with uh you know a small dose of nicenic acid and uh but uh the trick there too is the the the methyl donor thing you know get just going this goes to the idea of supplementation too so um you know so if for people supplementing with nmn or nr or niin nicotinamide or nicotinic acid you know that's well known to deplete methyl donor so you know it's all over the internet too and there is published data that supports this that when supplementing with nad precursors it it can deplete methyl donors leading to increases in things like homosysteine which could potentially affect me uh methylation age too because methylation age is clearly it's a hyper or hypomethylation process right so um homoy is one of the leading indicators for overall cardiovascular issues right yeah vast that's right definitely the the rcts don't show any any improvements though which is tricky because um you know so reducing homosysteine doesn't show from my reading of the literature and it's not a comprehensive review but uh that's generally the argument against homo cyan as a biomarker it's what ises the r what did the rct show but these are in generally already sick populations who have some pre-existing condition so maybe homeless hising lowering in that case isn't a big deal but my goal is prevention and minimization of risk so you know can i delay any vascular related complications from uh elevated homosysteine rather than i have elevated homosysteine and now i'm going to try to improve my mortality r so i'm trying to prevent so i think it's a different story but so the tmg trith glycine is what people are like take tmg take tmg well i've done that experiment it didn't work for me i took up to three grams per day homocysteine didn't budge i've also done the searing plus b6 to pull homosysteine down away towards glutathione that didn't work either 6 gram of of serene in like 40 or 50 milligrams of which is like 13x my b6 that didn't work either on homo methyl b12 does reduce my homos by a bit but it goes to this idea of you know what are the methyl donors that are uh specific that you can take if you're trying to improve nad or you have elevated homosysteine that uh that are specific for you maybe it's not tmg everybody thinks tmg tmg t it may not be now along those lines i've also added which again it's going to seem like a simple change or addition but i've added oranges into the approach i actually cut the strawberries down and added an equivalent amount of oranges and uh i did that because uh oranges have proline betane which is at the end you have a couple of methyl groups now can that act as a methyl donor i don't know and not the only amino acid that is d or trimethylated like trimethyl glycine has three methyl groups attached to its nitrogen proline has two there's tryptophan betane which has methyl groups so there are many amino acids besides glycine that are di or trimethylated that can potentially act as methyl donor is that going to be enough from 100 grams or so of oranges per day i i don't know i'll find out what are you uh hoping to see in your in your um in your metabolics that would change as a result result of moving from the strawberries over to the oranges like what which of the you going to see in the homocysteine you're thinking or where are you going to see that show up so that's an interesting question because you know i look at correlations between diet and the and the blood biomarkers and in a panel of 25 biomarkers strawberries are have a net positive correlative score with 11 of those in terms of how they change during aging and all cause mortality risk now that's unadjusted correlations i haven't adjusted for body weight body weight may be driving some of that as strawberry intake is increased as i've cut body weight down and body weight seems to be a big driver of improving biomarkers in my data so so the the risk though is if strawberry is driving some of those correlations i've reduced their intake and now increased it with oranges so i may get some you know reduction of positive effects by reducing strawberries with a small isolated effect if any for oranges but homosysteine is that primary driver just through the um the uh proline betane to increase proline bain which my diet had basically none of beforehand and if you look at if you look at my horvath epigenetic age and my homosysteine data without any b12 or additional folate uh it does suggest i have some methyl donor inadequacy or deficiency so i've got to try to and then it gets to this idea of diet specificity you know maybe the 20 of strawber vegetarian diet the deficit of b12 is is one of the first things that you're warned about with a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet is that you might not be getting enough of vitamin b12 so it's completely understandable yep but in my case fish i've got fish every day in terms of b12 intake compared to the rda i at like 5x the rda without supplements so it's not a vegan diet uh and actually a little bit more right right yeah so but it goes to the idea of uh and it may not be a b12 issue at all it may just be methyl b12 has some methyl donors i i need to have a boost in methyl donors for whatever reason and i'm not really fixing the problem i i'm i'm open to even taking out the methyl b12 at some point and just trying to bu tweak the diet and get more methyl donors okay great so uh let's continue on and talk about some of the other things that we have um sort of the beyond the food and beyond the exercise so um i'll start off on this to sort of give an example on this because it's something i've been thinking about um is one of the things that we can talk about as habits that are healthy but are be just um going to the gym and the kitchen so uh one of the things for example um and this has been uh become popular lately is the sauna as a term of all cause mortality reduction and this the studies off this and we'll link them below are mostly from finland because they have a strong sonuna culture there but uh the data is quite compelling um they have rcts that show things like um improved lactate threshold in v2 max which is a really good measure of cardio vascular uh overall health uh health and they say they have studies there that show that going to the sauna about four to seven times a week and they they have the the baseline is quite funny because there aren't any people they could find like in a city of 4,000 people they could only find two people who didn't go to the sona at least once a week so the baseline they're comparing to is people who go once a week but even so the people who went four to seven times had a 40% reduction in premature death so one of the things that i've added to my overall schedule is that i go to the sauna regularly here where i live down the street there's a local bath i'm in japan so there's a local bath that has actually a sauna in it but the thing that's interesting is that i found um some recently some other studies that show other similar effects for other ways of heating the body so it seems like the sona is actually a way that your body to fool your body hack it if you will into thinking that you're still doing exercise so the study um and uh the study refers to uh wearing a sauna suit which is basically wearing a trash bag so that you continue to sweat uh even after your exercise and it compares going to the sauna wearing a sauna suit and also just taking a hot bath so sitting in a hot bath of um that nice toasty bath for a long time and uh in the last actually couple of years they've had a study that's been released in japan that showed similar cardiovascular benefits not as strong as the sauna but similar where they're showing increased benefit as far as uh reduced uh strokes and heart attacks and other things from just people who are getting lots of baths every night in the evening as traditional here so that's one of the things that i do that's uh further than that the other things are um the would be the dental care is another thing where they have strong uh reductions of premature death and i especially like this one because it's different from the other um studies oftentimes people think well yes of course if someone takes good care of teeth they're uh taking care of their body as a whole they're seeing the doctor all the time and all these things but actually the the specificity the specificity about it is that brushing your teeth is helpful for longevity when done in the evening and only in the evening like if you brush your teeth in the morning that's great it helps ref fresh breath maybe gets rid of the coffee smell in your breath but uh it does nothing for your longevity it's only when you brush it in the evening before you go to bed and there's other things as well flossing your teeth once a day at least is healthy and reduces premature death and then there's other ones that are sort of not what you'd expect for instance mouthwash and uh you recommend bristle uh on your youtube channel quite often for measuring the oral microbiome and i've talked with the scientist there and they echo this that actually a mouthwash doesn't show any benefit in terms of improving the oral biome in general and the all premature death studies find that as well is that yes it's great to brush your teeth that will extend your lifespan but doing a mouthwash doesn't seem to have any effect at all so those are two habits that i find to be quite helpful as terms of all cause mortality that have the numbers to back them up that i make sure to incorporate in my daily routine so wait so starting with the the sauna i was just taking notes because i didn't want to interrupt but so so i haven't focused on the sauna in in terms of like videos or information because it's there's it's already so saturated like you know ronda's got like hours of content on sauna the the initial flags that pop up in my mind are um what's the bmi of that study what's the bmi because i i think the data is probably an o overweight overweight people who maybe have hypertension or prehypertension and i can i can see i can see a road where that may be the sauna would have benefit for that for that specific group group of people uh and especially like overweight or or obese just you know bmi greater than 25 probably not fit or active so in that case it's like you know when you exercise you're going to get the increase in body temperature and then um increase in body temperature may be part of a you know vaso d vaso dilation program where you're you should be able to reduce blood pressure over time whether that's because of the heat or other you know health promoting effects of exercise the just and then this is again speculation but i haven't read those studies i haven't paid paid attention to it but i hear the sauna story everywhere right but um from my experience at least here in the states the people who are most likely to use the sauna are these overweight don't exercise out of shape uh and again maybe have some so i can see a road where that's beneficial but then it gets the idea of um you know if you take someone who's not hypertensive not overweight already lean and fit if you have that group and now they're in the sauna four four to seven times per week and maybe even like a randomized crossover trial where you you know you have them sauna then you have them go out of the sauna for a few weeks so you know you're seeing if there's an effect of improvement and then does it come back to baseline i don't know do those studies exist i mean they have the studies there are the interventional ones where they're doing an rct and these are standard rct so these are being done probably on honestly college students i haven't actually reviewed that um doesn't mean they're not um 25 uh over 25 bmi but of course they're all controlled for bmi that's standard right um so it's a it's an interesting thing but uh for instance the studies that are talking about the bathing in japan which is one of the the thinnest countries in the world is not going to be subject to that um that's probably going to be fairly clean as far as most of the people are low weight so i think there's something in it beyond just um sort of dealing with a higher bmi and it does seem to be beneficial to do it after aerobic exercise in particular um the sweatsuit and hot bath and sauna extt study that i saw was talking about this specifically about doing 15 minutes after going for like 30 minute run or so but uh it's something worth looking at and then the other question is which biomarkers besides blood pressure and i guess maybe you could look at uh i mean the ideal if it's a cardiovascular disease risk kind of thing where it's reducing that risk i mean you would look at uh soft plaques or even calcification like i i i just don't know if there are studies showing some you know uh effects on those cardiovascular related outcomes besides blood pressure like i just don't know what biomark how would you you know so subjectively it feels good when you heat the body up like that and even after a song like but for someone to say oh it it works because it it makes me feel good okay that's a different story than what's the objective data actually show in terms of you know well there's i mean i've actually double down and have increased my sauna time as i'm getting ready for this marathon because of the benefits on the v2 max which is your cter respiratory health which is a key driver of marathon performance um so i've been doing that and also it raises the lacto lactate threshold which is sort of the point at which you start to get your muscles get sore from ov exertion the other end point that they've been looking at aside from the premature death is also um in the sauna studies they've been looking at specifically cardiovascular death so death from cardiovascular disease um heart attacks and other things and in the japanese bath study they were then looking at just stroke or cardiovascular events not going so far as death and i think that's probably because they don't have as quite as strong i think probably the sauna is more effective but just a hot bath is a good measure and much more convenient for the great majority of people than finding their way to auna after doing exercise yeah so that ties into probably blood pressure and some you know slowing of atherosclerosis if it does but what if your blood pressure is already normal i get the argument for you know the v2 max potential benefits there i mean probably pro athletes should be doing this this stuff you know pushing your v2 max even a few units higher is going to have benefit in that case right but if my v2 max is 50 versus 52 is that going to really make a difference on longevity versus the time commitment you know and not just that what's crazy is i see some people i'm not antia i'm just being skeptical right you know uh what's that that guy's uh you know robert shurmer i think his name is the skeptic yeah anyway that guy is just always a skeptic about everything i'm not i'm not trying to be that guy but um so i just had something in terms of sauna um anyway just playing the skeptic fair enough all right so um oral oral so oral oral care yeah so uh in terms of so yeah i get you on the brushing and the flossing regular cleaning too how often whether it's every six months every year that that can contribute too because the plaque buildup you want to get rid of that keep that at a minimum but um yeah taking that a step further it's it's you know in my case trying to well in the first case get rid of this bacterium that's consistently 95% of my oral microbiome which i think to me is a potential time bomb ticking time bomb where i maybe my mouth and system won't be able to keep it limited uh you know sepsis is it's it can cause sepsis some you know uh anyway trying to eliminate this thing and then people like why don't you take antibiotics all right so maybe i kill off you know first of all it's oral it's not a topically applied antibiotic i would eat it it goes to my gut i'm going to obliterate my gut microbiome which is a problem allowing potential you built that up over years right i've built that garden over years i don't want to just get rid of it but then you know some of it will will indeed impact my oral microbiome potentially eliminating that bacteria but the other side of that is um antibiotic resistance sadia which is an even bigger nightmare and i say that as someone who studies the microbiome and you know getting rid of antibiotic resistant bacteria on its own is a problem that's like a particularly nasty bacteria once it's antibiotic resistant so um the rac is on to get rid of it but then assuming i didn't have that in my oral microbiome there are certain bacteria that have been linked um with alzheimer's disease cardiovascular disease you know whether they're found in the brains of alzheimer's disease patients or found in the plaques in cardiovascular disease or can specifically cause it in mice like ping jaalis so um yeah making sure that i get rid of the sadia and then uh once i'm back to a normal microbiome keeping these bacterium bacteria that have been linked with uh poor systemic health a top the list to me that's the cutting edge it goes beyond you know flush uh brushing and flossing which you know but the idea too of mouthwash the store bought mouthwashes that contain things like alcohol which many do uh which you know the there there are published studies showing that that can um uh affect blood pressure so basically you're killing off oral oral bacteria and those oral bacteria have some positive role on regulating blood pressure systemically so um yeah alcohol based mouthwashes are i'd stay away from those right i i stay away from them in general um cuz some of the other ones that aren't alcohol based and are still kind of based off of um kind of uh strip and basically kill the entire microbiome which is where as we've talked about you want to cultivate the positive bacteria as opposed to just uh nuking everything and then hoping the good ones grow back right but that kind of gets into the idea too of okay alcohol and mouthwash is bad but then you know toothpastes are loaded with like these uh you know sudsing agents sodium doco whatever sulfate and other stuff like that so i haven't done a deep dive there um and i'm sure there'll be people in the comments saying just take some coconut butter or coconut oil and mix it with sodium bicarbonate and brush your teeth i i don't know that that's best the best either there are no rcts on that right but um yeah but there are things in toothpaste you know that you know whether it's additives or preservatives like for example the whole preservatives impacting gut gut bacteria and uh that could be true too in terms of the oral microbiome because it's so understudied um they're just you know who knows what's good or what's bad in terms of you know what a toothpaste should even look like right so yeah figuring that out is on the to-do list okay right soh what else should we cover today what do we got on the list alcohol aha alcohol all right let's see gotta share screen long as we're talking about something more serious than just the alcohol in your mouthwash yeah so so first in one of the life expectancy studies um it's this one let's start off there um see hard for me to okay so yeah um this is the the study where it was uh and again it'll be linked in the comments five factors that uh increase life expectancy men and women so here gained or lost life expectancy compared to moderate alcohol consumption so um that was the reference right no alcohol and then you've got the highest intake so light blue and red so for women um what was it here you can see that there's a loss of life expect expectancy for the highest alcohol intake 30 grams per day so what is that uh a glass of wine is about 12 grams per 100 ms so you know it's like three drinks per day reduced life expectancy similarly for men um but in men you can see well actually for women too light blue no alcohol almost just as bad for life expectancy as um uh two and a half or so drinks per day uh but even there the even in in this study the you know there's no gain in life expectancy with alcohol intake it's just minimizing a small loss if any um you know two years or so for the abstainers which is a very mild effect but okay this is just uh one study and then i've got another here that was um recently published right association there we go right now we're in business okay so meta analysis published in march 2023 and uh this is the largest meta analysis that i've come across 107 studies on alcohol all cost mortality 4.8 million people um so in contrast with the earlier meta analyses low low volume alcohol drinking not associated with protection from death uh death from all causes so scrolling i know i got the the perma scroll here but uh see so they separated it all right i don't know if you can see this now can you see e figure 4 yep so so um i don't know why this data is slightly different from what their main results are in the paper i mean they i'd have to go through the tables um i know one of the tables they they defined the groups differently so you've got non-drinker occasional which is like one drink per week less than 1.3 grams per day so you can see compared to a non-drinker very occasional not associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk but you can see the and that's the you want to see the the fully adjusted right so this a solid line that would be here and then the confidence interval you can see it just just barely crosses one so not significant so that's one maybe one drink per week then you can see the low volume group for the fully adjusted model uh up to two drinks per day significant reduction in uh all cause mortality risk so but then above that 25 to 44 grams per day it um we've got increase risk so you can see that's above the hazard ratio of one the confidence interval and then you've got significant increases for greater than 45 grams of alcohol per day which is like four drinks per day so um but in the in the study in the main study here here and i don't know why i can't open this as a pdf but um the way they define the groups it you know whether they define i think if they define the reference as the occasional drinker um then the low dose for uh up to 25 grams per day wasn't significant and the reason they use the occasional drinker is because i guess there is some selection bias in in uh abstainers where they used to drink and maybe they stop because they're sick and there's some re reverse causation in that uh whereas if you go with the occasional drinker i guess that's minimized so when the reference group is the occasional drinker the low volume group wasn't significantly associated with reduced risk but i think there like like the plot showed there is that trend towards having a lower risk with the low volume uh alcohol intake it's you can see it's just outside the confidence interval being less than one which again goes to the idea of is you know what's what are the other variables where a low a very low intake of alcohol um what are the other variables that help you actually reduce that risk by 7% in this case um you know i don't know what that i don't know what that would be you know so yeah it's um it's been uh this is a an often referred to study i'm i'm pretty familiar with myself the interesting thing about this is that um when they originally uh started the study they were trying trying to say that if you look at someone who has a quitter sick quitter is the term they use um they say that alcohol looks like it's healthy only because it's compared to people who are were drinkers but quit because they were unhealthy and therefore they're saying that that is the comparison it's people who are already sick but this this study is very clean that it took people who are ab abstainers and then you also have lifetime non-drinkers know that they've never drunk a drop so it's not not possible they've just quit because of some other thing and they found in this case as well that basically the people who have um are infrequent drink occasionally but maybe once a month or so versus the low volume have a benefit especially against the people who have never drunk lifetime abstainers um the people who used to drink but quit are the worst usually because of the reasons that they talk about where they were unhealthy before the former drinker versus abstainers is what we see here right um but then they uh shifted again to say okay well let's see how about people who drink uh moderate amount how do they compare to people who drink just occasionally and you're right they don't find that they're significantly differ but i would say that basically you've already prove the point that low amounts of alcohol are fine whether it's occasional less than one drink a day or whether it's one to two drinks a day or less basically it's shown that it is a beneficial and uh they it in um some of the cardiovascular studies and some of the other things and everyone agrees that once you get over that and um i do that on a semi-regular basis with my friends as well so um not everything is uh strawberries all day long um but it's uh it's part of the mormal the normal thing but it's something to be aware of is it it does seem to have some benefits in that low range and if it's something that you enjoy you should go for it um harvard has a very good good write up on this that uh we should link in the post as well that talks about there are some benefits at a low ben at a low basis but clearly not if you're at any way at risk of going into the higher numbers where all that benefit would be lost and the damage to the family and your livelihood could be severe um so i i uh i i like this study quite a bit because i think it brings up that clear point in the later studies then they do um what i call pew washing where even beyond this where they've taken out the lifetime at stain lifetime abstainers and shown that there's a benefit then they add in like another six or 13 different categories and they do something that i call pwashington um and so if you really enjoy it then you shouldn't stop it because you think there's a harm to it at best this would only be able to show that there's not a direct harm for it as opposed to the um poisonous at any dosage kind of things which i think is clearly not the case and we should save our efforts for places where it's really going to make a difference in premature death as opposed to something that if you enjoy it and are able to do it within a controlled fashion is something that you could enjoy as part of your life yeah no so that's a good point that you made that uh uh it's not associate so at worst the low volume group 1.3 to less than 25 grams per day there's that it's not significant but there is that it's not that it's not significant does suggest that it's clearly not harmful you don't have an increased risk but there is that trend towards a decreased risk so uh but like you said if you've got you know alcoholism or whatever in in the family and and uh you know staying away from the higher intakes because you know that's associated with increased all ca mortality risk let alone let alone the damage to to family you know so um so actually i alcohol is a potential option on my to-do list too and um but i've okay gonna get you drinking coffee we're gonna get you having a beer in the evening yeah so so dhea sulfate um it you know so the clients during aging and uh there is some evidence linking alcohol intake to to relatively higher levels now i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing because um but the idea that it could potentially move the needle towards improving it a little bit and the reason i raised that is because uh d testosterone is derived from dhea which is derived from cholesterol so my testosterone levels are youthful total testosterone youthful so i don't have it i i clearly don't have a problem in going from cholesterol to dhaa to testosterone so uh because to get to testosterone you have to go through dhea so but that my dhea sulfate is you know more than half of what it was in my 20s early 30s when i have data just two data points but i don't know if that was with dhea supplementation or not but it's clearly lower it's it's and it's 50% lower now granted i've maintained it over the past year or so but knowing that it declines during aging um there is i do have a window for adding a very small amount i'm not talking 25 grams per day you know what's the minimum amount of alcohol that would move the needle in my case where i don't mess up heart rate variability resting heart rate because you know i'm sure you know there's well an abundance of anecdotal data people saying look at my data just one drink data you know so i don't want to mess that stuff up but there may be uh a small dose like you know less than 100 milliliters per day far less i mean maybe half that where i'm open to including it to try the experiment so i um for myself i do follow the moderate um on the days when i'm moderate uh i do just have literally a beer and i don't see any impact of it um it's eyeball to be clear um but i'll have full recovery days according to my whoop after that um i can't tell the difference between the days where i have a beer and the days that i don't is that beer earlier in the day or is it later in the day or it doesn't matter for you just of dinner um so it's it's about 7 o'clock or so in the evening and go to bed at around 10: or 11 wow i mean uh any fluid intake at 7 o'clock for me is like there's just i have there's no way it's crazy that you can have any fluid intake and not mess with sleep so okay yeah um different things i don't know i find that that uh helps me actually um if i' have the beer then i tend to knot off a little bit more and then go to bed earlier so maybe that's why i'm not seeing the impact because i'm getting a slightly improved sleep from it interesting interesting all right so we covered yep i'm just going to say of course if you once you get to the heavier consumption of alcohol it's well known that that will then improve uh impair sleep yeah um y so you've got the right dose you know so that's the key finding the dose right yep so we covered it all we covered it for today i think that's enough for today yep cool all right until next time chris okay great to talk to you michael h
