# Which Nutrients Are Associated With A Younger Brain Age?

## Transcript

Which nutrients are associated with a younger brain age to address that question let's take a look at this recently published paper that investigated nutrient biomarkers of healthy brain aging now the importance of this paper is that those nutrient biomarkers were plasma levels and not questionnaire based as questionnaires can suffer from recall biases people have to remember what they ate or drank and in terms of healthy brain aging this too was an objective measure as it was determined by mri so the the study included 100 people that were 65 to 75 years old which then segregated into two two groups those who had accelerated brain aging this was defined as having an average brain age that was older than their chronological so in this group the average brain age was 65.1 years and then a delayed brain aging group that had an average brain age of about 5 years younger 59.7 years now in looking at the traces we can see that the accelerated brain aging group had more people that had an older brain age rel to their chronological age so in counting the traces i think i counted 10 10 people in that group that had an older brain age relative to their chronological whereas in the delayed brain aging group i only counted four people that had a had a brain age older than their chronological but note that even in the accelerated brain aging group there were a lot of people that had brain ages that were younger than their chronological but in the delayed aging grou group there were a lot more people that had brain ages that were younger than the chronological and we can see that for some people their brain age was as much as 25 years younger than they're chronological so the delayed brain aging group on average 5 years around 5 years younger than the accelerated brain aging group but what about other variables were they different between the groups so we that's important because if other variables are different between these two groups then maybe it's not these plasma nutrient biomarkers maybe it's other factors so what were those other factors and we can see them listed here on the left as measures and then we've got our two groups accelerated and delayed brain aging and then when looking at the p value on the right hand side none of these measures were different between these two groups of measures of brain aging so let's dig down into that a little bit so first starting with the metabolic equivalent of v2 or mets which is a measure of v2 max we can see that those values are not different between the two groups nor were uh measures of physical activity or the resting heart rate which are argues against a role for the group that had delayed brain aging being more physically fit or more physically active bmi was not different between the two groups nor were its components height and weight waist and hip circumference were not different between the two groups as a measure of abdominal osity and standard variables that are usually adjusted in models or model the standard variables that are included in models for adjustment including sex so the percentage of men and women education and income were also not different between these two groups which then goes back to our nutrient biomarkers so which nutrients are associated with it or at least in this study associated with a younger brain age and that's we'll see here this is the plasma nutrient profile of the delayed brain aging phenotype now the good news is that some of these plasma metabolites can be tracked and potentially optimized and that includes vaccin acid otherwise known as octadic acid gondoic acid otherwise known as eos acid epa fish oil fatty acid epa uh eco eosa dioic acid and choline which is probably more familiar uh you know of all the nutrients on on this list that's probably the most familiar to most people and the way i've been tracking that is with iolo's atome metabolomics kit which besides these five nutrients also includes data for 600 others discount link in the video's description so what's my data so we have we've got levels of those five nut plasma levels on the left and then the goal is to keep the sum of these metabolites relatively high and avoid any age related decrease so what i'm doing is for each test i'm taking the sum of these five plasma plasma nutrients plasma levels of these five nutrients and in 2023 i had five tests and then taking the sum for each of these uh five nutrients for each test and then taking the average so the 2023 average over those five tests is then 258 micromolar for for these five nutrients so then i have three tests in 2024 nd stands for not detected and then same approach some of these five nutrients for each test and then the average for for the year-to-year looking at year-to-year changes we can see that my current 2024 average is 456 micromolar so 2024 is off to a good start i am waiting for another uh test that's uh may 28th i sent that data it hasn't arrived yet i guess iolo's been slammed with business so i'll have four tests uh coming up soon to analyze data now the other plasma metabolites on this list can be potentially increased by diet and i say potentially because increasing dietary intake is one way to potentially increase plasma levels of a giv or nutrient but there are two other variables in that equation which includes endogenous production which may have nothing to do with uh dietary intake and also degradation for example the fish oil fatty acid epa declines during aging and that's not likely because people are eating less fish but more so because of inflammation which is well known to lead to epa and also dha degradation so how can we increase levels of these plasma nutrients or potentially increase these levels by diet so starting with the first one ala that's commonly found in foods like flax seeds chia and walnuts uh lignoceric acid which is a 24 carbon saturated fatty acid that's found or abundantly found in peanuts and i i'll put the link to that paper and the other papers in the video's description and then carotenoids including lutein and zanthin those can be potentially increased with green leafy vegetables and these are low oxalate containing vegetables here collared greens lettuce and kale and then we've got some vitamin e isoforms including alpha toa fero which is found in almonds and sunflower seeds but also red bell peppers and then gamero which is abundant in pistachios but also flax seeds amongst other foods and and then last but not least i wasn't able to find any pubmed references for doosa dioic acid so if anyone's come across a reputable source where we could potentially increase that by diet uh please share it in the comments and i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics epigenetic testing any mod ification or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cci fox health which includes apob and also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
