By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Every one today's guest is dr gear schmid shine who is a distinguished professor in the shu shuchen gene le department of bioengineering at the university of california san at san diego today dr shon shon bine will present his lab's work which focuses on the novel hypothesis that aging is impacted by autodigestion and for those who may not be familiar not autofy but the process of autodigestion and we'll get all into it dear dr sh will get all into that into uh his presentation so with that welcome gear okay so michael thank you for the invitation i'm going to talk to you today about auto digestion in a nutshell what that means is this we human beings many other species on the planet uh digest themselves and this has very far-reaching implications i have a conflict of interest it's mild and uh i need to emphasize that the people really done this work are listed here um wonderful collaborators students in the and posts in the lab and i'm going to highlight today especially the work of frank delano and and eric kler why digestive enzymes well if you go by the literature and you look at peer-reviewed publications um if you look at the national library for medicine and under the term aging aging in the title you get 82,000 references these are all peer rebut if you now go ahead and you put in aging and digestive enzymes you put both of these words in there how many publications have come out as of last uh two days ago it's exactly one so that may tell uh somebody a young student uh this is not a good topic area to get involved in and uh then the question arise so in other words it's not a very crowded field um i uh been thinking about this for quite some time and actually the starting point for our work was coming out of the field of shock this is a a a community of people they're working in the intensive care unit and they are dealing with problems where individual is hurt in an accident or to a drowning and a particular model that they like to use is called hemorragic shock all you do is is place a fal catheter remove some blood and then return the blood afterwards say after an hour and what you observe there are many things but the one i want to talk to draw attention today is you will have a group of animals that survives this procedure 24 hours later they just doing fine and then you have a group that is nons survivors and i've been very curious is about the same procedure the same chemical uh constituents why would there be a group of individuals who who fall victim to this event and remember this is a young teenage rat so a is healthy as they will ever come um in order to gain in insight into this phenomenon uh we decided to do the following experiment we uh took plasma of these survivors at the end of the experiment and we exposed them to naive cells we happen to like working with lucaites uh here's two skinning electo micrograph of them and so these naive cells are seeing now the plasma of a survivor in contrast if you take the plasma of a non-s survivor you discover that these cells go into an activated state that's just like if they were um um uh froyos in bacteria a high percentage of the cell go in this activated state it has severe consequences for the microcirculation but the most important question comes to mind we have two plasmas and one plasma stimulates these cells so the obvious question is what causes and what's in this plasma that causes this type of stimulation i spent quite a bit of time on that and many suggestions were made some people believe believe it's bacteria it could be bacteria products uh like endotoxins complement all kinds of ideas were brought out we tried these and several of these and we always ran into the following situation let's say complement yes we find compliment components from the compliment cascade but when we make an effort to remove that compliment or block the complement receptor we do not see that this type of stimulation disa appears and so uh i was quite desperate actually at this point uh we decided let's take a totally fresh idea and my student eric hisler uh had the idea why don't we do the following it says and perfectly healthy animal is able to generate a a set of stimulators in plasma it must be coming from on the organs so he decided to homogenize different organs you see them listed here and uh then exposed the homogenate to naive cells just like you saw previously most of the organs produce ah something like 10% not much more with one exception and that's the pancreas it's very consistent highly reproducible the intestine doesn't stimulate the um these these these cells unless you go out and you um add the constituents of the blood that what we're seeing here is actually after we washed the intestine uh once you leave the intestinal content in it would behave just like the pancreas um now if you add trion this is an experiment you could add many other proteases you see every organ now becomes a stimulator for these cells so every organ is now suddenly a inflammatory mediator and it can possibly lead to death so that was the first indication that we need to pay attention to the pancreatic enzymes now you are the experts on pancreatic u digestion so i'm going to be very brief uh and want to remind you of some items that in this discussion play a role so here is a pancreas 95% of the pancreas is used to uh generate the digestive enzymes the other 5% generate insulin and these enzymes are released in a proor there a little uh symbols with a with something in their mouth they end up in the dadum in the dadum they'll be activated through the entro kinases that are expressed on the epithelium in this region of the intestine and then the food with the digestive enzymes goes on this long ride through the intestine now there's um of course this is well known today there is um a pretty comprehensive system designed to digest every biological molecule other than fibers uh our digestive enzymes uh can break down every protein uh every carbohydrate every li um lipid and all nucleuses so they are designed by nature to be as non-specific as possible um the other angle to this um is especially important for us uh if you take a sample out of the intestine and you find out what is the digestive enzyme activity we do this by adding a substrate that once it's activated by a digestive enzyme it will um turn into a florescent signal and so we can ex read in fluorescent units the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine no surprise um there is plenty of activity in our particular experiments uh we have unit dis are fres units 2,700 units somewhere between 3000 there but now comes an interesting uh comparison how about if we take in the same animal now a plasma sample and read the florescent units and those numbers are orders of magnitude smaller um this about order of magnitude of 10 maybe 15 20 but not much beyond so the observations you make at this point wait a second there is a huge prelic activity in the intestine has to be because we're digesting and there's very low prootic activity in the plasma per se and uh you are justified to ask the question okay i can eat a intestine this is citrine style uh i can digest that intestine but i don't digest myself how has nature come up with a solution to this uh problem um there are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed but dominating mechanism is is that people i've identified a set of protas inhibitors against tron and choton that are synthesized in the liver and these are uh binding molecules permanently in abil um um permanently in turn the trion in an in in in active form same with kimot trion we have large amounts of these in our bloodstream in fact probably um they are of the amounts just like albin and fibrin so nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against the tron and choton and the other s proteases the other mechanism is that we like to focus on that nature has come up with an idea why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine and we then put a barrier so that the digestive enzymes cannot get out the barrier has to be cl ever it has to allow uh nutrients like individual amino acid and so on to get through but um not digestive enzymes they are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger um so as a result one needs a barrier and this barrier is illustrated here the blue color you see here this is a villis and this is in the lumen of the intestine and this is at the base of the intestine um and we labeled this particular bu with a uh agent that stains the muin in blue color so we see lots of muin here and the entire intestine is covered by muin and they specific isoforms um there are two isoforms one is a isopor that's released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen they mix with the food and then there is a second even more important uh muin 13 isopor that is on the top of the epithe cell in what some people call the brush border that particular muin is is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes to get through low molecular weight can get through but not large molecular weight this is how nature would like to see things but if you now um look at the activity this is again with a rate that changes its florescent properties when you apply it on tron in a sham it has you can very little activity it's the same situation again the lumen of the intestine is at the bottom and the bly tips are at the top and uh when you then go ahead and you introduce this is a 15minute es schic period or 30 minute scheming now we see something new we see that digestive enzymes actually made it in into the wall past the tip of the v and all the way in fact through the lumen of the intestine um this is a very severe form of injury to the intestine so there are many grades of uh that type of uh that type of um infiltration of digestive enzymes into the lumen um the if you look at the morphology of the epea cell you see that in fact even after 15 minutes there is already a loss of the muin and there is in part a breakdown of the bly if you go to 30 minutes there is now a point where the entire billa tip has been removed and now your digestive enzymes are directly exposed to your own tissues um and this can be seen if you look at either one of the two musen isoforms it can also be seen for other digestive enzymes this is uh with a substrate that's cleaved by lastes and you see a similar pattern that with progression of the and broke breakdown of the barrier there is eventually a full infiltration of the digestive enzymes now what did they do it well i can only highlight here one or two items uh that are relevant for this discussion as these digestive enzymes enter into the bloodstream the first molecules they encounter are the plasma proteins so here is a uh scan of the various b mass back span of the various proteins and uh other bio components that are typically in the plasma of a rat um each spike are well recognized molecules that are associated with the lively and and support various types of physiological functions if you now take from the same animal this is before sh a plasma sample after shock and run the same scan this is how it looks like this is best described as a wholesale destruction of plasma proteins biomolecules in the plasma there's a large increase of the low molecular weight fragments uh so plasma proteins are being degraded into smaller elements and uh the uh this animal is of course incapable of living if without these biomolecules the other aspect is the as they enter into a bloodstream they come in contact with the endothelium and with many other cells and what we looked decided to look for is how about if we look at the insulin receptor so here you see in this diagram a picture of a microvascular network with an aral venus vein and capillary and in this particular sample the insulin receptor has been labeled with a antibody against the extracell domain that's the binding domain for insulin and on the insulin receptor how does it look like in an animal in shock well the insulin receptor are still there but you can probably appreciate they're longer no longer at the same concentrations if you now go ahead and you block the digestive enzymes we do this by um entering vers an interial pathway in other words directly into the intestine noral lumin a prodas inhibitor this is a tron inhibitor then we don't see this reduction of the insulin uh receptor density on the surface of of the cell and so this is one example of many i could show you that when digestive enzymes enter into the circulation there is a compromise on surface receptors this is like a type two uh thing so the the when digestive enzymes enter they clip surface membrane receptors they degrade plasma proteins and the extracell matrix i didn't show that but you can demonstrate that extracell matrix proteins are being degraded they generate peptides in turn which have their own activity and the whole system becomes very confused so it just generates a molecular chaos and if you allow this process in a shock model to go on it will lead eventually to multi-organ failure in other words to death so this is a serious process um what does this situation look like with the enzymes in the aged ones well we just completed the first study on that and the question we asked is the most fundamental question do we find digestive enzymes in the tissue outside the intestine of an aged animal so here is a uh cross-section again of the intestine the the same orientation um the vli look upwards into the lumen of the intestine and this particular section was labeled with a antibody a monoc antibody against tron um there's then a secondary an but a classical imunohistochemistry uh so that then the substrate that's attached to the secondary enzyme makes it possible to visualize where is tripson this is a typical example of a tron in a young animal and young means in this particular four month of age when we do the same thing these are identical conditions in an old animal looks very different now we see in fact an infiltration of a this a brown substrate we use in this case um that is um clearly enhanced in the old animals if we take an old animal that we treated for uh two weeks with a tron inhibitor they receive that in in the uh in the water they drink and then we see this behavior now in order to quantify these things um we uh um decided to develop a optical technique that allows us to extract as then digitally the brown color from these images and then we display in the ground color they shown in a black and white contrast so that you can now actually see from these images what is actual tripson present and what is uh what are other elements here so this grayish color that you see in the old animals is all due to tripon um so now now is the question intestine is perhaps not too surprising that it's infiltrated but what about other important organs the first one that comes to mind when you think of the um contents of the intestine passing into the circulation the first part they have to go through is a liver in just about all species and in the liver now we see a very substantial enhancement of tripson presence in a typical vill of the the sinus villis if we go to the lung that's next organ in order there is a very substantial infiltration of digestive enzymes quite noticeable um now let's go on and by the way we measured these again by an optical density measurement and what i'm saying here is supported by the direct measurements if you go to the heart you make an interesting observation um the digestive enzymes are dominantly between myoides there's a myosite here and it's the gap between myoides the intertial space where the tripson appears um it's still present in old animals but of course with greatly reduced u magnitude after this two we treatment you go to the liver this is in in the the as this is on the in the domain close to the um the um vortex and uh you see there is a very distinct infiltration of digestive enzym often just around the capillary and again this is reduced when you tak all treated we look in the brain so now the brain is the organ most remote from the intestine uh whatever comes from the intestine into the circulation and into the brain has just breached two major barriers that we have in our body and here you see in fact the labeling of digestive enzymes is often in the basement membrane of the capillaries so uh there there's it's everywhere in the brain but there is this especially enhanced observation um measurement of the digestive enzymes in these capillaries this is supported again by direct measurements if you look in the skin uh you find that digestive enzymes in the young ones are virtually absent in the old ones it's present uh in the dermis subdermis and especially around the follicles the root of the follicles and this is again attenuated but not eliminated by uh in the old animals finally another view of the whole thing this is a topical view onto a bunch of microvessels these are venal arterial capillaries and they are sitting on the outflow part of the intes uh in the mesentary and there you find that the venal are uh especially high labeled with digestive enzy if you block them in the lumen of the intestine this goes away so the question now comes up is well you showed this for trips and how about other rasis so we take an antibody against elastase again pancreatic elastase and we do a similar imunohistochemical label as as i just described uh you see even in young animals there is a bit of elastase especially along the um lymphatics but it's greatly enhanced in the old ones uh the same holds true for the liver for the lung um this is for the heart we see another pattern like this that the digestive enzymes are in the interstitial sprays predominantly in the kidney this is in the tubular region of the kidney and in the brain we see a a overall infiltration the way we designed these experiments is we want to know how do things look look like when you look at larger parts of an organ let's say uh one lobe of the lung and another l of the young how would the labeling look like and uh if you look at these standard deviations that we found there it's remarkable uniform in other words if let's say you go to the lung and you take an upper l and a lower l you will see that in fact the density on average like this is pretty much uniform in other words the animal becomes infiltrated by these elastases in agent in age group that is leaves no corner of the animal out there is a non-uniform pattern at the level of the individual cells or micr structures um as i explained but the uh uh experiment uh is um is remarkable in the fact that the pancreatic enzymes infiltrate the organs so uniformly in the old ones um then we want to went on okay let's look at alast days in the case of alast you see a similar pattern we oops no and this is amales i'm sorry there's a typo um and amales again is infiltrating the uh old tissue but not the young tissue so in this first part um we obtained evidence by which one can conclude that in an old animal at least in the old rat the digestive enzymes enter in a more or less uniform way into various organs and there's really no part of the animal that we could find that's not infiltrated now as i emphasized previously the real important uh structure that controls here where digestive enzymes go is the mucosal barrier here is a top view of the mucosal barrier in the rat close to the jum upper part of the jum and you can see when we label fusin uh we we see this dense distribution when we focus the microscope on the bottom part of the individual v ey you're now looking down from thep up um again there is a very high density of amusin they all the majority of these are in in the goblet cells um so and by the way the villi are not finger like they are ridg like um um structures and that's how it looks like in an old animal uh it's just a stark difference um the density of this and identical light conditions these experiments so that you can really draw andar will i uh are reduced in terms of muin density and the base of the v along with it um this can be reversed if you to some degree but not completely in the old animals by our two-e treatment and uh this can be illustrated also in another way this is a double staining technique again we look from the top down onto the intestinal wall these are the individual vli and we lay this same section with an antibody against trion so now you see in brown the trion over here quite visible and uh in the old animals you see that the uh treated animals that the tron infusion and tron appearance in the wall is reduced so as the density of the muin is reduced you have more leak of tron into the wall uh if you do the same thing with amales you see again the same pattern um the the uh the u villi in a young animal really close off the escape of digestive enzymes which in old animals is greatly attenuated and in an old treated animal is partially restored but never completely restored um look at a little bit higher magnification this is villas you're looking at on it edgewise you see the line that's the muin that's attached to the epithe cell and then you see plenty of these blue uh goblet cells uh two examples here when we look at the sel light conditions at the intestine of a old animal uh our animals are 20 um four month old we see now still some m but you see this dark brown labeling and that's due to tron uh several examples where you can see that if we go even into further details and ask the question okay when where is the time when tripson first enters into it we try to address this question by a double labeling technique and this is on thin sections uh so we can see things on a cell level here's this an individual villas the lymphatics and some sub osal blood vessels you see that where the the the tron is present you can see this even further in if you do a color extraction the tripson is present where no um m is in fact the first entry of tripson here at the tip is at sites where the goblet cells have just discharged their m that's suddenly a cell that is somewhat exposed and this is the place where we find these uh musin appear tripson appear in in in the bloodstream uh this gets carried into the the villas into the lymphatics of the villas and from there on into the central circulation so the question comes up well okay there's digestive enzymes appearing in the these various organs does this have any consequence well in aging research as you know there are many different forms of aging indicators one can use we decided to go for an aging indicator which is so obvious connected to the aging process and that's the breakdown of the extracell matrix so we were able to uh utilize a um what's called a collagen hybridizing peptide that was developed at um at uh in in the university of utah and at at um in baltimore and uh this um allow us on a section to look at where is collagen broken down again this is the black and white color extraction and you can see here that in a young animal there are individual vly they have plenty of collen breakdown uh in other words this test allows us to see not only where is collagen but actually where is it broken down on the molecular level um we look at old animals they have plenty of that virtually every buis is in the process of breaking down its collagen and if we look at treated animals it's restored but still just like in the young ones there are plenty of villi that have a collagen breakdown uh now here's the liver um the liver of a young healthy animal is uh free of any digestive enzymes if you go to an old animal you see this red dots uh plenty of sights in the uh microvascular structures and the tissue structures that lead to a loss of um collagen integrity and suddenly a labeling with the hybridizing enzyme po peptide it's partially restored and old you see that sort of a stereotypic pattern every time we treat an animal uh we can in part restore what it used to be before we don't rejuvenate it but we restore what the animal had when they were younger and the same we see the lung in fact in the lung you see a dramatic form of collagen breakdown more than most other organs let's look at the heart um the heart is very interesting pattern you see i told you earlier these are my iio sites and the digestive enzymes are in the gap between these this interstitial space and that's exactly where we find the collagen breakdown products same pattern old treated animals you restore that and this is the color extraction is in the kidney is in the gl region and plenty of sites where collagen is being broken down uh and then in the brain quite interesting if you look at this black and white the color extraction uh the capillaries and their basement membrane are brok being broken down this was also the site where we saw tripson previously and um elast days so what this indicates there is at least a spatial correlation between the presence of digestive enzymes and the breakdown of the the the collagen the story the the situation is greatly restored again through the treatment you look at the skin we talked about this earlier uh the skin in a young animal just doesn't have any breakdown of collagen that is we detect with this particular technique in contrast an old animal has plenty in this makosa submucosa plenty of breakdown of collagen and again in the treated animals that's in part restored so now comes the question and i come to the last part of this presentation um is it ever possible to demonstrate that tripson is actually present in our bloodstream and especially tron activity so we use again a substrate that's specifically clipped by tripson and the students in this particular case decided you want to investigate this question after they had a high-fat diet meal and it only takes some about 15 minutes to eat that meal and then they take their first blood sample one at the very beginning and ask the question is there a significant increase and the answer is yes every one of the students had an increase irrespective of male female so only about 15 students 15 or 20 students they show saw this increase the increase does not exist if you skip the meal after about an hour the proteus activity is reduced and then over a period of 5 hours uh there a typical fluctuation it's never quite steady state if you want to measure trips and activity you really have to follow time courses how about others last days activity same pattern um and that teaches us that even we young individuals run the risk that digestive enzymes leak into the circulation um when they eat um i did not speak much about the second what we call the secondary enzy these are like for example metalloproteinase they are activated by trion it's the most effective molecule to to do so and when we look at the mmp this is an substrate that's cleed by both mmp 2 and n uh we look at these we find again a similar pattern there's this transient increase which disappears if you do this with a diabetic plasma and a diabetic individual then you start to see that in fact the uh the activity is really really higher we were quite interested to find out if this plasma has this activity in other words it clips little substrates that which are totally artificial uh constructs but if the plasma has activity so that it can cleave the substrate may maybe and one should ask maybe it's clipping some much more interesting thing so just like showed you earlier we took an antibody against the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor and we labeled then individual cells after they have been these are naive cells then have been exposed to the plasma of these individuals and you see even the controls have already a reduction of the uh receptor density and if you take a pre-diabetic one and a truly diabetic one you see a traumatic loss of these receptors what that teaches us is is that as somebody eats a high-fat diet meal and has leak of digestive enzymes into the circulation you instantly lo loose insulin receptors so that's in essence what i wanted to tell you um i summarize it here with a diagram with a cartoon under normal circumstances our food that we eat is digested in the lumen of the intestine and it's not elsewhere um the intact muin layer is responsible for that protection and it follows the traditional physiology that one learns in gastroenterology if however we allow a autodigestion to occur then in that particular case um it starts by a breakdown of the barrier the bli may be ed away alt together digestive enzymes now get out they can leave through blood vessels they can leave through lymphatics and on the lymphatic pathway actually they bypass the liver and they leave directly across the entire wall of the small intestine and appear in the um in in the uh um extracellular fluid so in essence digestive enzymes can escape through all pathways once this occurs the um systemic circulation is affected and we are dealing with a multiorgan dysfunction so that's what i wanted to tell you i thank you and i want to leave you with a new greeting and that is for the future i wish you a very slow autodigestion thank you all right thanks ge that was great um you could take it off share screen i have a comment and then many questions great i'm sure i answer on them all when you look at aging and then aging and autodigestion and when you mentioned that yours is the only your group is the only paper that's published on aging and autodigestion and you mentioned yeah actually let me clarify that that particular paper is from dr greenberg published somewhere around 86 and he asked this very interesting question is there a possibility that digestive enzymes in an old animal are different from a young animal and he says yeah they're not producing quite as much but basically it's the same type of enzymes and similar levels of activity that you have an old one but other than that there's no other publication as a matter of fact you can go into other fields cancer and ask is there a relationship between cancer and digestive enzymes you find a similar statistic it's been completely neglected so i agree and when you mentioned that it doesn't seem like that'd be a good field for a young student to go into because there's only one study i see it the other way where you you've opened up this can of worms where uh there should be a lot of studies and i'm going to go through the full list because there's so many more studies that need to be done to really flesh this out and see how much of a dent that it makes no question no question yeah go ahead all right so with that in mind so uh i looked into the diet that you guys used in the uh in the young and old uh rat study right so it's standard rodent chow right but the the composition of uh protein carbs and fat it was 32% protein so is it possible that a young animal can can live just fine you know with very little protein digestive leak uh on a on a high 32% is a high protein diet like if we translated that into grams per kilogram body weight that would be three grams per gram body uh per kilogram body weight which is i mean 1.6 is like the upper limit for people who are in uh you know regular exercise training all right anyway so a high protein diet now you've got an increase in the protein digestive enzymes the young animal can get away with it but then over the course of time the the body is just not able to deal with that and that's a part of the process for the increased leak of the protein digestive enzymes is that some factor uh that may be contribut a very important question you raised thank you what when you eat a meal what can possibly open the mucosal barrier um there are two cases i can tell you for definitively and then i come back to the protein if you eat a high-fat diet meal you eat lots of triglycerides your lipas which by the way starts to be secreted in the salivary gland so it's present in food as already before it enters into the small intestine um the lipase will generate free fatty acids free fatty acids have to be very carefully carried in the bloodstream u that's why the reason why we have so much albumin and they have free fatty acid binding proteins in the intestine itself it's a rich field of activities and free fatty acids on the other hand if they are not bound it's a totally toxic material and the reason they are so toxic is because they dissolve in the lipid membrane and they kill cells no questions asked and as a result of course you have a breakdown of your barrier the other aspect is alcohol so ethyl alcohol is um well if you want to clean your petri dish with a bunch of cells on it you use ethyl alcohol ethyl alcohol also dissolves directly in the membrane and you get u a really unable um destruction of the of the cell when it comes to proteins and protein content we honestly first of all i have to make clarify that we don't have any data at this particular point are there certain types of proteins that can cause additional damage there always proteins that may be degraded and in large amounts uh and then generate a secondary reaction for example a b cell reaction for antibody formation um we have not looked at this stage into to what degree the mosal barrier is infiltrated um by b cells for example um so we we followed a very simple concept let's just take the chow that the rats can get and the final point i make to that is the following i'm very much concerned about the mechanical properties of the food we eat why do i say that well if you eat um let's say an example is chow uh in in a dog and you eat uh like a dog does without chewing at all it just takes in swallows it the kibbles right and uh no questions asked well these very rough surfaces now appear in starting out in the intestine in the stomach going into the intestine they may be dissolved already into pretty much a soft tissue but if they still have that rough surface that's to me like sandpaper writing on on this epithelium and there are some reasons in the literature to be concerned about this when it comes to longevity so owners of dogs have to make a decision should should i feed dry food and how does my dog eat or should i provide uh wet food which is much less convenient but um that story i think is um potentially a important story also for humans it depends on what you eat and how you chew yeah all right so then i have more questions off that so i guess one study to test the protein being too high an increase in digestive enzymes at the body or at least in rats for now can't tolerate with aging uh maybe that could be one reason why methine restriction i don't know if you're familiar with methine restriction extends lifespan and maybe because you're reducing protein intake you're reducing levels of protein digestive enzymes that are secreted and then less potentially would leak into the blood leading to autodigestion right there is older literature uh in the 50s and 60s where gastroenterologists asked the question if you eat a high percentage of protein with the concentration of tron and kimot tripson last days in the in in the pancreas would it shift and the answer is yes these are long-term exposures so the pancreas knows what proteins it needs to break down and adjust itself i don't know how big this issue is uh would it make over lifetime a difference yes it could be but um we need to look at this today in the context of the idea that not only you need to we need to digest but we also need to avoid the autodigestion in other words the escape of digestive enzymes yeah and the your point about the uh chewing making sure you chew and don't just swallow like right yeah i think that's a great point because uh well it's a great point because uh the act um so what i'm trying to say is uh there's some there's some evidence that mincing meat helps with protein digestion um with which means that more of it will be absorbed into the blood in in terms of the actual amino acid verus less of that being escaping digestion now reaching the large intestine where it can be broken down into bacterial proteases which then create all kinds of nasty products ind doxil parresol sulfates that damage all kinds of tissues so is some of that going on here too where um so for example during aging there can be a reduction some studies show it it happening and other studies don't show it where there's a reduction in stomach acid so that means that there'll be l protein digestion and absorption more reaching the large intestine and then could it be that that uh you're actually seeing some bacterial proteases too can the antibodies that detected tron in the blood differentiate between human and bacterial tron or elastase or any of the other proteases i honestly i don't know um in the small intestine i work with rob knight who is interested in the microbiome um we have yet to determine a enzyme a a bacterial enzyme that could participate in a major way you have to keep in mind when i think about this there is some truth to your statement but i always look at it what are the important reactions and the digestive enzymes that come out the pancreas are so dominating this process of digestion that um i i'm i'm i'm ignoring what i'm interested in along those lines is are there bacter that love carbohydrates because if those are present in the small intestine they'll chew down the muin and that's a real compromise of the barrier there can't can't be worse so um long-term these things have to be still investigated to be quite honest yeah so that raises my next question so uh i know that fiber deficient diets in the large intestine can lead to a reduction of the mucin layer and then it can be easier for you know bacteria and other microbial products to leak into the blood from the large intestine so that implicates a role for fiber in the large intestine on mucin and having a thick mucus layer to minimize that risk but what about in the small intestine i know that the goblet cells will produce mucin but uh f are the effects in the large intestine for the muc m muc mucin layer does that go upstream or what's helping form mucin in the small tested well let me tell you a story i have a student who did a master thesis and i asked that student it's published as a master thesis we have not completed the story but i give you the the essence of it if you take the content of the intestine uh and you ask like in this early experiments i showed you what are the tripson or chatson activities you find something quite remarkable if you go from the small in over the length of the small testin there's no gradient we find in a rat is just about the same activity somewhere around 200 2,000 f units if you now go into the large intestine where the rat forms its pallet if you transition through the seeum into that part of the the rat has a very large seeum it's different from humans but you go through the seeum you can already see it and then you go up the ascending part of the large intest across you start to see there is a total loss of digestive enzyme activity there so there is something going on uh tr who did these studies he concluded there is probably a material that's being secreted from the epithelium that actually blocks digestive enzymes we haven't been able to identify this on a molecular level but i view this now as an issue you know if this weren't the case imagine the concentration of digestive enzymes would come out at the descending part of the the the animal it would literally be sufficient to destroy the all barriers at this p so nature must have come up with an protection mechanism that is um and looks like there's actually there to turn the digestive enzymes off so the human digestive enzymes but the other side of that is that there are b material uh protein digestive enzymes in the large intestine and so one way to minimize the uh protein degrading or amino or peptid degrading bacteria in the large intestine is with short chain fatty acids which acidify the colon and that makes it harder for the uh protein digesting okay sorry peptide digesting bacteria to survive in an acidic environment in the large intestine but short chain fatty acids at least in feal samples decline during aging so it's possible that that allows for the protein uh digesting bacteria to grow in number in in the large intestine not human digestive enzymes but the bacterial which then raises the point of which i i know i mentioned already but maybe it's possible that some of those are leaking into the blood too absolutely no question there is rob knight suggests that there are bacteria going out and that can very well occur under various medical conditions uh i have no problem with that but always keep in mind if a bacteria bia gets out digestive enzymes have long gone um bacteria is the size of a house a uh a digestive enzyme is a size of a little cube so clearly from a transport point of view if bacteria gone out digestive enzymes have already left a long time ago ah right right right preceding it so calorie restriction then would calorie restriction i think i saw you in another talk you mentioning calor restriction should minimize this effect the more calories you eat the probably the greater likelihood of having uh proteases leak into the blood in the simplistic way when you reduce your calorie input you eat smaller meals and therefore the damage to the intestine with every meal that you eat is reduced timed eating is is another example like this if you eat uh nothing over a certain period of time that allows your muosa barri to repair itself that by the way is always in repair it's the the intestine is the organ with the highest gene expression and the uh the the it takes about a couple of days to fully restore an intestine uh intestinal villas but there are plenty of stem cells in the submucosa and gastroenterologist study this at great detail there's a constant repair mechanism in my for my point of view is how can somebody survive a severe esia where the entire length of the uh villas is now reduced all you need in order to have a functioning intestine is you have to close the v they don't have to be very long if they're very long they can absorb of course more nutrients but if they're relatively short as long as they seal they protect you from your own digestive enzymes so that then raises the interesting question of so after eating uh i guess you could quantify this right where depending on your calorie intake and maybe even protein uh uh intake levels there'll be some magnitude of autodigestion that would require some amount of time after eating where you don't eat for the villi and everything else to repair itself um but no do you have any insight to what that window may be the no the answer is it's i can only speculate on circumstantial evidence um the good news i have is we have now developed a technology that allows you to measure protolytic activity in a blood sample whole blood sample um this is an e effort together with fellow biden mike ker who is a retired professor at ucsd an interest in nano engineering and we have now a technology that indeed you can take a blood sample le very small finger prick to measure the activity with these florescent units and these are experiments that are ongoing but i can tell you that uh animals at risk or humans at risk uh have an elevated protolytic activity and this is again it's transient these are not just steady state value you can think of it like a glucose value you measure one glucose value doesn't teach you a lot you have to really follow time force same with digestive enzyme so is that escape that you asking for is that a time dependent phenomenon no question in my mind but um the exact time when the barrier opens with a particular meal and the particular considerant of a meal and the time when uh it's been repaired that time course is of such importance for all these uh timed eating experiments that needs to be measured and then these uh uh timed eating experiments can be really based on a rational basis yeah definitely uh so for example uh mice that are cal 40% calorie restricted they live about 30% longer and uh they eat basically uh triple their food on a friday and then fast saturday and sunday and that's in association with that lifespan extension so clearly that one day of having triple calories can't be that bad from the autodigestion point of view because they've got two days i guess to repair it but yeah i'm i'm excited about uh seeing the you know more spe specific details in terms of all right so and then also um there are in terms of biomarkers if regular people wanted to measure uh because you can measure you can get a blood test you know at standard labs uh commercially available labs where you can measure el lastas and um amala you know pancreatic derived enzymes and blood so i'd imagine if you see higher levels in blood over time uh that's probably a bad thing but are there other biomarkers that we could use maybe commercially available to track this not yet commercially available but there is one biomark i mentioned it very differently when the digestive enzymes act on your plasma proteins for example in every experiment we have carried out and did mass spectrometry we find a large increase in number of peptides in other words the the tron is such a non-thinking protein non-specific it just degrades every protein that comes its way as a result you have a large number of of amino acids especially in the range between 5 kilon to about 20,000 kilon in other words this is below the size of normal plasma proteins telling us that these have been degraded that is a a very strong correlates very strongly with proteas activity no surprise um i mentioned the measurement of proteas activity now with a new technology so that you get actually a quantitative measurement and uh the particular technology one more item uh that we are currently and that we have developed is one in which you measure rus activity but in whole blood as compared to plasma and it turns out um i'm thinking of a group of pancreatic patients that the digestive activity in whole blood is about 10 times higher than what you see in plasma in other words there is a lot of digestive enzymes tripson in included that are sitting actually on membranes like the red cell membrane and uh therefore one really has to look at the different components that you take and ask uh where is where are the trons and then of course on the other side of the the coin uh what is your anti- alat tron look like in severe forms of shock we find that the antirion has been chopped into hundreds of peptides and they could potentially be also a biomarker that uh we don't have a sort of a lab technique one has to go through mass spectrom which takes a couple of weeks before you come back so clinically in incompatible but if there are specialized uh peptides that one peptides elements that one looks for there's a good chance that we will be able to develop a technology that is uh truly useful uh in a clinic so uh trion cleaves at which amino acids is there a specific amino acid signature that's based on tripson there's high probability it cleaves at arginine um and the same you can now is actually listed in literature you can look for kimot trips and they all have relatively specific site so if you look at the um peptides uh it's a nice exercise because you can actually tell with certain probability how the peptide was actually generated so would it be arginine containing peptides then in the case of tron yeah in the case of tron yeah and if you go through this list of peptides it's it's a long list um about 100,00 or so uh and you then ask a question um was where was tripson involved you look for these ar arginine residues and get an estimate of that and when considering that oh sorry since there are more multiple enzymes often being activated also it's not just the digestive enzymes but they activate for example the mmps i mentioned and i'm sure they activate also calines they activate um cathepsins and possibly other proteas after all we have more than 500 proteases um according to the genome so in this particular situation um one can get a um indication of which prasis you're involved in and it's a very important um piece of information because it tells you what you need to inhibit yeah great great point all right so um i'm guessing albumin would be a major target of protases in blood because alumin is the most abundant circulating protein so alumin levels decline during aging so could someone seeing an age related decline in their own data could that be potential indicator that very nice experiment that you're suggesting absolutely yeah cool and then so i think you mention you lose the albin just to follow up you lose your um free fatty acid binding capability yeah the other the other side of that too is that albumin binds to um bacteria derived metabolites like indoxyl and parresol sulfate that are protein digestive uh uh fermentation products so it's that's so if if you've got an increased leak of tron and then albumin's declining not just the fatty acid that it's binding to it's binding to potential gic metabolites that damage the kidney the heart the endothelium so aben is a big one um so you mentioned you mentioned um we clearly we we evolve to have antirion uh uh uh antibodies in our in our blood do those decline during aging according to this greenberg paper that i cited this one that's been in the literature um yes it they decline into the biosynthesis similar to other proteins there's a decline of proteins in general i don't think they're coming from the liver i don't think that uh these are relatively unique in in that process in that aging process together with many other proteins they decline how significant that decline is uh again remains to be determined by actually proteas measurements proteas activity measure um does this make a big difference in the age of an old person um should one do a transaction and uh the liver can be transacted and we enhance the gene expression of alpha anaton uh can also be given orally as a matter of fact it's the only inhibitor that is reasonbly inexpensive that we can afford and the other because of the fact that there are families that have polymorphims in in the gene of that and they are being treated uh a lifetime with antirion uh the others have not been produced to any significant degree they're very expensive to get a hold of uh so there is a real need for further development uh in order to test these questions that you ask nice uh so future studies future studies by your lab what can we expect to see you have any stuff right right um i give you two thoughts um aging is the highest risk factor for literally every human disease cancer you name it and we now know that we have the first evidence that uh digestive enzymes are part of the aging process as well as death it's just a question of magnitude when it comes to multiorgan failure uh once you are in a hospice uh you when you die you die by your own digestive enzymes with your loved ones standing around that tells me that this process this this degrading process is probably not unique to just the process of aging we have the first evidence that for example diabetes this insulin receptor cleavage occurs in these animals when digestive enzymes get out and so that raises the issue can we block the digestive enzymes in a clever way without stopping of course digestion is there a possibility that we can attenuate this process i'm pretty certain we can and we're trying to develop techniques uh in order to block the digestive enes when they get out of the intestine so is that with intravenous uh infusions of the antiproteases or how would you yes that's a possibility uh we haven't gone to that point uh but um we our idea is the following the digestive enzymes are this huge concentration in the intestine at about 1% in the tissue itself so if you take a small molecule a competitive inhibitor that can diffuse through the mucosal barrier and can get out so now the trick is is okay you block digestive enzymes but only to the degree that's necessary in the peripheral organs and you hope therefore that the digestion in the intestine still is able to continue this large difference in concentration may open that possibility and we're testing that at the moment fantastic can't wait to see it uh hopefully we'll have you back on and you can tell us all about it looking forward to that yeah all right well thanks ge i appreciate you everything you presented today and all the knowledge you shared and uh we'll see you again soon yeah i hope we meet sometimes in person bye by ciao
