# Resting Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability: What's Optimal, 2,061 Days of Data

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

With the goal of longevity a major premise of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible with that in mind resting heart rate and heart rate variability provide information about the heart but also the nervous system and adrenal gland and we can see that here so obviously resting heart rate and heart rate variability are measures localized to the heart but they are impacted by the balance between sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves in particular the vagas nerve but but also sympathetic nerve activation of the adrenal gland which leads to production of nor epinephrine and epinephrine which impact resting heart rate and heart rate variability so we can see in this image that these two measures are an integration of the heart the nervous system and the adrenal gland so with that in mind what's optimal for resting heart rate and heart rate variability in today's video we'll take a look at how these measures change during aging and then additionally i have more than 2,000 days of data so what's my data so first how does the resting heart rate change during aging and that's what we can see here and these data are generated by whoop i'm not here to say they're the best that's what i've worn since 2018 so on the y- axis we've got the average resting heart rate plotted against age from the 20 to 50e age range and for both women in red and men in blue we can see that wrestling heart rate increases for both up to 50 years but what about older than 50 years and a clue for that comes from the data for women women after 45 years where we can start to see an age related decline now changing into a separate graph this is now fitbit data in a published study of more than 990,000 people and all of the papers in this video will be in the video's description so in this study which was average wrestling heart rate versus age but now the age range is from 20 to 85 years in agreement with the whoop data we can see that there is an age related increase up until about 50 years for women in green and men in blue after 50 though there is an age related decline for the resting heart rate now note that relatively low resting heart rates are found both in youth and in older ages so how can we know if a relatively low resting heart rate is ind indicative of youth or aging this is where heart rate variability comes into play as that provides more context so how does heart rate variability change during aging and that's what we'll see here so this is a study that included 8.2 million people on the y- axis we've got the heart rate variability measure that's the root mean squared of successive differences that's what provides so that's what i'm showing in this video and then on the x-axis we've got the age from 20 to 60 years and then there are two lines the solid and the dashed the solid lines are data heart rate variability generated at 6:00 in the morning and the dashed are heart rate variability generated at 6 at night regardless of when it was measured we can see that there's a uh age related decline for heart rate variability and i covered this in other videos and if you're interested in that check out the heart rate variability resting heart rate play playlist but older than 60 heart rate variability continues to decline so now that we know hrv declines during aging we can address the question is a relatively lowring heart rate of indicative of youth or aging and pulling up our plot from before we can see that at relatively younger ages we'd expect to find a lower resling heart rate in conjunction function with a high heart rate variability conversely it at older ages we'd expect to see a low wrestling heart rate in combination with a low heart rate variability all right so now that we know what should be optimal for aging a relatively high heart rate variability in conjunction with a low resting heart rate what's my data i've been tracking this since 2018 so i now have 261 days of data since that time and we'll start off by taking a look at taking a look at the average yearly resting rate from when i started tracking in august of 2018 through the end of q1 2024 march 2024 of this year and we can see the full data here each dot is a single day's worth of data so when i first started tracking in 2018 average daily resting heart rate was about 51 beats per minute and then i reduced that to 49 beats per minute in 2019 to 48 in 2020 47 in 2021 an average of 45 in 2022 2 43 in 2023 so that's the average daily resting heart rate and for each year average yearly resting heart rate and then in 20124 thus far after the first 3 months average wrestling heart rate is 42.1 beats per minute now rather than looking at year-to-year changes we can analyze these statistically with a two sample t test so when i compare q1 2024 versus full year 2023 thus far the data is a significant reduction in 2024 p value 0.001 and when compared with when i started in 2018 q1 2024 is significantly lower compared to uh 2018 so from these data we can see that i've consistently reduced the wrestling heart rate from 51 to 42 beats per minute since 2018 but remember a a low resting heart rate is indicative of youth but it can also be indicative of older ages so what's going on there now in terms of the good news i've a voided the age related increase for the resting heart rate as we can see that it increases from 20 to about 50 years but am i just experiencing an age related wrestling heart rate decline as shown by the red arrow so from more context we look at we'll take a look at heart rate variability and over that same time period more than 2,000 days of data now we're going to take a take a look at the average yearly heart rate variability which is shown here in 2018 average daily hrv was 47 milliseconds i increased that in 2019 to 56 around 58 in 2020 then i had a regression in 2021 to about 52 milliseconds but then back on track in 2022 59 uh 66 in 2023 and thus far after q1 2024 i'm up to 67.8 that's the average daily heart rate variability in each of these years and when analyzing this statistically to sample t test q1 2024 is better than 2023 up to now with a p value of 0.001 and when compared with when i started in 2018 2024 data is currently better than where i started with that p value of 1 * 1047 so from this plot we can see that i have increased heart rate variability from 47 to an average of 68 milliseconds per per day since 2018 and i think a lot uh of people say things like heart rate variability is an independent measure and you know it's uh that's your data and don't compare against the reference population but we can see that it can be improved and not by a little bit by a lot in particular i've been able to increase it by 43% so now we can uh address and answer that question is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so we pull up that plot again or actually not in this case so a high heart rate variability in conjunction with a low resling heart rate would be what we'd expect to find uh in relatively youth relatively youth in contrast based on chronolog logical age a lower heart rate variability 35 based on the plot that i showed earlier and a higher resting heart rate of 57 based on the whoop data would be expected so what's contributing to these improvements since 2018 and i'll cover that in the next video on wednesday all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging uh check us out on patreon where i include daily data for resting heart rate heart rate variability and a whole bunch of other stuff we've also got disc links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing nad quantification oral microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob and now grim age green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that enjoyed the video have a great day
