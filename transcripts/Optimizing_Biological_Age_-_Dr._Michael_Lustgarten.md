# Optimizing Biological Age - Dr. Michael Lustgarten

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey hey everybody my name is mike loss garden i'm a scientist at tufts university and today we're gonna talk about optimizing biological age so the biological age calculator that i'm going to talk about today is levene's phenotypic age and what that comprises are 9 clinical clinical variables and that's shown here including abdomen creatinine serum glucose inflammation c-reactive protein the percentage of lymphocytes of total white blood cells the average red cell volume red cell distribution with alkaline phosphatase white blood cell count and age as the tenth variable so the importance of this biological age calculator is illustrated by the finding that it's highly correlated with chronological age so these 10 variables the it's correlation with chronological age is 0.94 so a chronic a correlation of 1 or negative 1 is ideal optimal as good as it gets so a 0.94 is pretty close to 1 so it's a very strong correlation between these biomarkers with being able to predict biological age or yeah so that that data was derived from the national health and nutrition study a big dataset relatively big data set of about 10,000 people so they replicated that these findings the beanery phenotypic age calculator as a measure of biological aging by looking at a separate data set in haines 4 and this data set included 11,000 people and you can see visually that phenotypic age was a little bit even more strongly correlated with chronological age with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 now just to put this in perspective the epigenetic lock horvath initial epigenetic lock the correlation between that with chronological age was 0.97 so 0.94 to 0.96 is pretty close to that if not you know identical somewhat identical so all right so why is it important besides this ability to predict biological age so the nation of those 10 variables are also associated with risk of death from all causes also known as all cause mortality risk so for every 1 year increase in phenotypic age for your biological age all cause mortality risk increases by 9 percent you can see that here by looking at all cause mortality for the full sample 9 percent increase significant significant 9 percent increase for each 1 year increase in a biological age now this finding was also true whether it was looking at young adults middle-aged adults are old in older adults so there was a higher risk of all-cause mortality with a 1 year increase in phenotypic age now in terms of disease specific deaths almost all of them on the list here heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease diabetes influenza or pneumonia which may have some relevance to colvin related conditions but that's pure speculation and then the fright is so for again for everyone you're increasing phenotypic age each of these outcomes the risk for each of these deaths from each of these outcomes increases with the one exception for cerebral vascular disease phenotypic age was not associated with that in in haines for so optimizing biological age how do you do it so you just go to your doctor get your the standard chemistry panel which is commonly performed that the yearly physical plus the cbc the standard blood chemistry count which includes white blood cells red blood cells hemoglobin and the differentials and then it also you would have to ask for c-reactive protein so the combination of those two 75 to 80 dollars at least in the us it may be different than other countries in just a for comparison well yeah so it's relatively cheap compared to other measures of biological age including the epigenetic clock so i have somebody crunched the numbers in and so that i embedded that link on this link here so if you want to calculate your phenotypic age if you have all these blood test data you can actually calculate your own biological age using the phenotypic age calculator and knowing your biological age is interesting but optimal is better so how do you do that so how does he channel light change during aging what's its association with risk of death from all causes and then what's my data i'm going to show some of my data where it could work applicable can diet fitness for optimization of body composition impacted and for the last part of this i just want to mention that i could have i could have used you know large epidemiological studies to say hey in this study of 10,000 people this has been shown to reduce albumin but and i actually started with that approach when i first started tracking and i noticed that a lot of what's published in the epidemiological study weren't affecting my biomarkers and it wasn't until i started more rigorous blood testing and dietary tracking that i was able to find the diet pattern that best influences my biomarkers as opposed to what's been published in large cohorts so let's see what the so let's start with what's my biological age so this is my last blood test measurement two months ago in march and after putting in all of my data i come up with a phenotypic age in 31 years 30 1.61 years i should mention i i think i have eight or nine measurements that include all of these blood test variables over the last two years when i first started measuring my phenotypic gauge was higher it was actually 35 something and i have articles on my website if for anyone wants to read about that so there you could say i've reduced my biological age over the past year or so and that's mostly by changing my diet improving my fitness in body composition which wasn't bad to start with but nonetheless it is indeed possible to improve this in the short short term so the b the importance of this number the 31 around you know 31 to 32 years old it's important because my chronological age is actually 47 some at least 15 years younger than my chronological age so as i mentioned one way that i'm reducing my biological age is through diet so every day with a food scale i weigh all my food and then i track that data using free freely available online software so i track everything including macro and micronutrients so protein carbs fat and then vitamins minerals whatever the food tracking software can track i log it into an excel file and then over the past year or so i started tracking actual food intake so how much of each food that i'm consuming because to just break down food into macro and micronutrients i may be missing a whole bunch of phytochemicals that that may be optimized in certain biomarkers so by looking at individual foods it kind of accounts for that so i've been blood testing about four to six times per year and because i'm tracking my diet i can then take the average dietary intake during that period that corresponds to the blood test and that's one data point so with enough data points i can have enough statistical power to identify potentially meaningful correlations between stuff in my diet and my blood tests now if you only measure once a year or less stop blast off that's often it's going to be harder to do that because you just won't know it's too imprecise so well that's what i do and then once identify correlations between diet with my blood test results i make dietary changes i'm constantly changing stuff in my diet to tweak my diet to see how it affects and to try to push my biomarkers in the right direction and it doesn't always do that so that's that's the trial and error that's the neural net i use that information and then i make further changes after that so in looking again at the phenotype phenotypic age variables i've just posted the reference range and the problem is most people don't know what the optimal range would be and so what i'm going to show everybody today is that based on how these variables change during aging and their risk how they change with risk of disease for all causes i think we can come pretty close to knowing an optimal mortgage so we'll go over that all right so let's start with abdomen and i'm gonna go through every one of the nine variables on lists and i want to mention that obviously for the for the sake of time there's no possible way i can go through every study for each variable so for the point of brevity i i'm gonna focus on the biggest studies that have enrolled the largest amounts of subjects these would have more statistical power to identify meaningful correlations and associations when compared with studies that may have a few hundred or a few thousand subjects for example here in this albumen study this is a sample size that included more than 1 million subjects so okay the reference range for albumen is 35 to 50 grams per liter but what's optimal so higher albumin levels are associated with biological youth and we can see that here so we're looking at how doing levels on the y-axis versus age and you can see the female plot and then we can see the male plot so males tend to have a higher abdomen up until about 60 or 65 than females so what about risk of death for cause actually before we go there so yeah and then going forward you can see that albumin very clearly decreases with age for both sexes so what about all cause mortality all cause mortality risk so this is again a big study 1.7 million subjects and we're looking at female mortality ratios on on this side and then mam mortality ratios on that side and then the x-axis goes from higher albumin levels to lower ab levels so how we translate this is higher albumin here so be greater than 45 i have it as i have it in milligrams per deciliter i didn't convert it back but it's the same so for 25 milligrams per deciliter or 45 grams per liter in men and for women greater than 44 um would be associated at the lowest risk of death for all causes and then each of these different data points are for different age groups so men less than 50 men or women less than 50 50 to 69 years old and greater than 70 so what we can see is that as albumin levels decrease risk of death for all causes increases for both sexes so can albumin levels be optimized so i first started tracking all of my blood stuff 15 years ago and at that time it was only about once a year i didn't really understand the importance of testing more off more often back then so based on those approximately once a year measurements for about ten years in my my average albumin level is four point seven four milligrams per deciliter which translates into 47 it's it's just the unit difference but yeah it's 47 grams per deciliter so already i don't you know whatever i was doing at that time you know i was already off the chart you know higher levels being associated with biological youth when i should have been somewhere around here so whatever i was doing at that time it was definitely on the right track i should say i don't have a longevity dna the lungs the person and lonesome man and my family's currently my dad who's 78 before that it was his dad was 67 so i don't have longevity dna i wouldn't attribute this to genetics so then in 2015 i started tracking more often i started dietary tracking and blood testing four to six times a year so i have 23 data points now for admin in the last five years and what we can see is that i've been able to increase my opinion levels from the four point seven four to four point 93 in using using t-test these values are significantly different so now i'm even higher off the chart than it was before when i should be somewhere here and there should have been some age-related decrease so i've been able to resist the age-related decline in album so one way i'm doing that is through diet and when looking at the correlations between my diet with albumin the strongest correlation is for beta carotene and so each data point corresponds to obviously albumin levels but then as i mentioned i track my diet so i can look for correlations between my diet with the biomarker in this case the abdomen so the correlation for beta carotene with albumin is moderately strong about 0.6 remember a correlation of 1 or negative 1 close as close to those extremes as possible is close to as linear as it is a linear correlation but it increases in training strength as you get closer to 1 so granted it's not perfect but it's a moderately strong correlation so i shoot for about five which is biological youth and to get there if you just look go across you can see that based on the plot around sixty thousand micrograms or 60 milligrams of beta carotene should get me there now i don't supplement beta carotene for me primary sources of beta-carotene or carrots orange sweet potatoes red bell red bell peppers spinach and parsley so i eat a ton of that stuff to get enough beta-carotene to potentially keep my albumin levels high so moving forward glucose glucose increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased mortality risk so first starting with how it changes during age large study again 12.5 million subjects we can see that so glucose levels on the y-axis and age on the x and women in red men in blue we see that men increase their glucose levels increased to about 60 were they somewhat plateau with a further you know additional increase towards later life from the 80s whereas for women that increase is more linear from around 28 or so all the way up to the oldest age here so you can see that on you know that lowers is is better especially when considering that it increases during the aging so somewhere around 85 86 is this found biological you now that number is important because we look at risk of death for all causes and that's what's shown here it has a ratio versus the circulating concentration of glucose levels so the lowest point of the curve is where lowest risk for all cause mortality would be and that for that it's for eighty to ninety four milligrams per deciliter so notice that below eighty eighty milligrams per deciliter all cause mortality risk is significantly increased and also anything higher than ninety four is significantly increased so based on this large data set it could suggest that eighty to ninety four would be optimal so resisting the age-related increase in glucose so again in looking at my once a year measurements from 2005 to 2015 my average blood glucose level is 89 and then as i've gotten more serious and tracked more often and tracked my diet i it's eighty seven point seven so comparing these two groups of data they are not different so i basically resisted the age-related change in coulis levels at least for now so how is my diet correlated with blood glucose so this is actually a strong correlation between blood glucose levels in my fat intake total grams of fat per day on the x-axis and the this correlation is 0.75 so it's pretty strong so what it's basically saying or suggesting is that as i eat more fat my glucose levels go up which is going in the wrong direction and fat is not all just one thing fats comprised of monounsaturated fats polyunsaturated fats and saturated fats so they may not all equally affect or be correlated with my glucose levels so within my fat intake the correlation between saturated fat with glucose is moderately strong so that may be driving this association without saturated fat so this the easy answer would be maybe to keep my blood glucose low just eat less saturated fat but as we see in a couple slides it may not be that simple so only forward c-reactive protein also increases with aging and higher levels are associated with a higher all cause mortality risk so the reference range is 0 to 3 milligrams per liter but that doesn't really tell us which way you know the for how much crp should be in terms of optimal for aging in risk of death for all causes so granted not many studies giant studies i mean millions of subjects have looked at crp in terms of aging the largest that i could find had 13 hundred or so subjects which is still pretty big compared to other studies but nonetheless these aren't absolute numbers too because even though it says it's in grams later the data were back transform long transform the back transform but the magnitude of the changes is what's important here so when looking at crp levels for men and women during aging so looking at you know the various age groups all the way up to 85 or older we can see that for men crp increases more than fivefold and for women it increases more than three-fold now again as i mentioned the reference ranges from 0 to 3 milligrams for depth per liter but that doesn't tell us what's optimally is is a crp of 2 just as just as good as a crp of 1 or less so let's have a look at some of that data so less than three lower crp lower than three is associated with lower all cause mortality can we get lower so in three studies less than one milligram per liter was associated with reduced all cause mortality or estación risk how about lower than that well in these two studies point eight six and point eight three milligrams per liter in these two studies and we can go even further another two studies found point five two point eight may be optimal but it didn't doesn't stop there four studies found that crp levels less than point three three milligrams per liter were associated with lowest risk of death from all cost so from this we can conclude or see you know the data suggest that i lowers better for crp and as close to zero as you can get may be optimal so i'm looking at my diet with crp and i have less data for crp because i just started tracking it last year so i think i have eight eight data points two four six eight data points and the strongest correlation is with my average daily fat intake so in this case higher fat intake total fat intake is correlated with a lower crp on the y-axis and even going forward within my fat intake but the the correlation between saturated fat actually this should be a negative correlation so it so higher saturated fat intake strongly correlated with a lower crp in my data so that would suggest if i eat more saturated fat and i get most of my saturated fat from coconut butter and kick cocoa beans and make homemade chocolate with cocoa beads so that may be a good way to lower cip at least based on this data but not so fast because if you remember a couple slides ago higher fat intake and a higher saturated fat intake were associated with higher glucose levels which would be going in wrong direction so these data illustrate that you know that it's a constant trial and error process you know anyone who uh you know professes to say off of one blood test hey this is what you should eat i think that's you know spurious it's a constant trial and error process and i've as i mentioned i've 20 up to 25 blood tests and i'm still you know constantly tweaking my diet to find out what's optimal across the board not just for warner or two biomarkers so finding a sweet spot for that is is key so going forward creatinine also increases with aging which is associated with a higher all cost tality risk so there weren't any good pictures for how creatinine changes during aging but in this study of 9,000 people again morgan levine's group said they found increases and all the studies have found increases for creatinine during aging even less directly but relatedly creatinine as a measure of kidney function so kidney function is estimated with the glomerular filtration rate egfr so because creatinine is a component of that egfr as a measure of kidney function declines in beiges plenty of data showing egfr is estimated with creatinine levels to climb with aging so that so it's pretty well established a creatinine increases with agent as it long story short so what about risk of death all causes so in studied 30,000 for 30 around 31,000 subjects looking at risk of death for all causes here yeah versus a creatinine level even though the reference range is somewhat wide the mortality risk is is actually with a lower within a more narrow range so what we can see is is lowest risk is about 0.8 milligrams per deciliter but as you go below that risk increases and as you go above that risk increases but when risk falls below one that's considered to be reducing risk so within that range it's zero point six two zero one point one milligrams per deciliter which is still tighter range then or more you know yeah it's a tighter range in the reference range so resisting the age-related increase for creatinine so pre tracking values my diet my average value over eight measurements in my 30s was one point one one and i've actually reduced that over the last five years whereas creatinine as i mentioned increases during aging and again these two groups of data are significantly different so whereas there was more variability in my data just as another illustration of why more data is better you know there's more variability when i was tracking less often but you can see the data is more tight is less range and one component that may be you know the dietary tracking - so what i just want to just popped the arrow up because of my last measurements i've been kind of playing with my diet looking to optimize my biomarkers and you can see that my creatinine levels increased so in addition to tracking you know the macro and micronutrients i also tracked food intake but i haven't done that for the whole 5-year period i've just been doing that for the past year and a half or so so i had less data for it but within that data i think is nine data points three six yeah so nine data points for creatinine levels with my daily average daily intake of eggs and cheese i don't need it every day but it's the average amount every day and actually there was a time when i increased it to see how it would affect my biomarkers so what we see is as my intake of eggs and cheese increased my creatinine levels went up which is going in the wrong direction so with that in mind i've cut back on my egg and cheese intake and that actually resulted in bringing my creatinine levels back down so for whatever reason whether it's acid load of too much animal protein or or what eating iii limit how much of the egg and cheese that i take in to keep my creatinine levels from going up so just to illustrate but so by tracking from all this data so far by tracking daily diet and circulating biomarkers you can identify the dietary pattern to leads that leads to the best biomarker profile for you all right so most of the data that i'm gonna show you going forward or some at least the rest of the phenotypic age biomarkers i don't have as strong data from my own data with it but wherever possible i'm going to show that data so next on the list is a lymphocyte percentage and a higher lymphocyte percentage is associated with chronological u now this data may look a little screwy superficial this is lymphocyte percentage as a function of chronological age in a large study 380 or so thousand people so what we can see is for men in green it pretty standard ly decreases from 28% of all white blood cells to somewhere around 18 percent so about a 10 percent decrease for the men but for women the the data is more obviously more variable so it starts it starts relatively high it comes down in the 30s it goes back up so that 50s and then it goes down again so that a woman at 80 or even 70 does indeed have less a lower lymphocyte percentage than when she was in her 20s so there most studies don't actually look at the percentage of lymphocytes they look at the absolute number of lymphocytes that and how they are associated with all cause mortality risk so let's have a look at some of that data so again big study thirty thirty thousand subjects or so all cause mortality risk versus lymphocyte levels and we see that with different colors so lowest risk for all cause mortality was found for leukocytes between two and two point six so two thousand to twenty six hundred i should actually shouldn't be either be here the ten to the third is 2000 2600 lymphocytes per microliter that's lowest first of all cause mortality and then the the highest risk for all cause mortality is pretty pretty obvious here that's having lymphocytes less than 1.5 or 1500 cells per microliter so in for the case in lymphocytes and you could even make the argument that having too high lymphocytes 2604 cells per microliter there it there is a small increase in mortality risk with the yellow line should be indicated there so from lymphocytes you don't want to go too high but you definitely don't want to go too low and especially in the age of coronavirus it seems that lymphocytes are dramatically depleted so that people who have died from current their studies and preprints that are that are out there that people have died from it have lymphocyte levels around 800 so that would put them obviously in this black market alright and as i mentioned i don't have any dietary data that strongly correlated so all i can say for that is stay tuned i'm going to keep blood testing then you keep dietary tracking and hopefully living more data i'll be able to identify stronger correlations so mean corpuscular volume also on the list how does that change with age and also again a lot a lot of these biomarkers aren't well studied in terms of aging in terms of sample size that have looked sample sizes that have looked at that in studies so this is a relatively small sample but it has some it has some weight but before i go there just note the mean corpuscular volume is basically how swollen your red blood cells are they filled with fluid or are they smaller and have less fluid in them so the reference range is somewhat large 79 to 97% and what this data is presented in two ways so this is data from the baltimore longitudinal study an agent where they tracked subjects longitudinally repeated measures over time up to 40 years or more so they had a small group of people who had multi measurements for up to four years 25 22 and 37 people what we're tracking them there is strength in the data because you're looking at the same person over time repeatedly and that ilustrate that you know why that's important in a minute so we're looking at the data longitudinally you see that the mcv i mean compressed mean corpuscular volume it increases from 8.8 all the way up to 90 to 44 in old now looking at the data cross sectionally so just groups of young middle-aged year old that were not tracked longitudinally we see basically similar data mcv increases during aging so in looking at mortality risk in a relatively big study 36,000 subjects mortality risk for men and women lower mcd's which are found in biological youth are indeed associated with a lower risk of death for all causes and we see that here for the men lower ncv is as the reference and then higher mcd's are associated with a higher all cause mortality risk and similar findings for the women so for mcv lowers better so next on the list red blood cell distribution width which most people at least thought for me when i first got my blood testing we go to the doc you get your physical you get your rtw just gloss over it because it's nobody ever talks about but clearly based on it being identified as one of the biomarkers on so you know it's important for calculating biological age it's important so what is it so it's essentially the range of the distribution of your red blood cells in terms of are they you know filled excessively filled with fluid or not in this case you have a low rtw because all the cells are approximately say the same size so the the standard deviation of the mcv which is how the rdw calculated is relatively small but you have red blood cell populations that are very big and very small you have a larger range and that results in a larger rtw percent so what's optimal well it increases during the age see that here with the rdw percentage versus age lots of data points these are individuals subject data so it's a big big sample size you can see that the rdw increases during age what about mortality risk so this is a data from about 30,000 subjects and all cause mortality risk on the y-axis and so we can see that the lowest risk of death for all causes is for rdw less than 12% and as you go higher each of these each of these plots aren't higher values of nc nc b so at least in terms of all cause mortality risk in this study lowers better but we can go even bigger than this sample size of 30,000 subjects for mcb in this case they looked at more than 240,000 subjects but the same trend was identified using our d double use of less than rtw percentages of less than 12.5 as the reference you can see that higher rd w's is significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality but 240,000 subjects isn't the biggest study that so this is actually study that looked at more than three million subjects and for that the lowest risk of death for all causes was for 8.1 to 12.5% for the rtw whereas risk significantly increased above 13.1% so for the rtw it would seem that lower is better so have some data that is moderately correlated with rtw whether it's implied oh no for me this may be a part of the story and how many calories i eat per day is moderately strongly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.5 with the rdw so because lower so tired calorie based on this plot it would suggest that higher calorie intake would be associated with a higher rtw which is going in the wrong direction so i've tried to shoot for values 12.5 or less at least based on the last slide and to get there if you bring the plot forward it's somewhere in the 2400 to 2500 calorie range so right now i currently average somewhere in the load 2500 and my goal is to get it somewhere closer to here but one step at a time all right so this doesn't tell you what you know calories can come from anything so what what could be driving this what should i cut out of my calories you know what food groups should i cut and identified a moderate and strong correlation between my average daily fructose intake with the rdw so the higher my fruit phases fructose intake the higher my rtw at least based on this this plot so i don't drink sugary drinks or sodas that's almost well i should say not never but it's almost never so most of my fructose is coming from fruit and vegetables mostly from fruit though so nonetheless with the goal of if this correlation is in fact driving change as an rdw if i reduce my or keep my fructose levels relatively lower i'd expect to see lower rdw so with that in mind i've been shooting for the left side of this in terms of fructose intake so somewhere around 70 or even or even less so two more biomarkers on the list alkaline phosphatase also increases during aging and higher values are associated with the higher all cause mortality risks so first levine again she found that ocalan phosphates increases during aging there are other studies that have also indicated this but i'm you know don't have the time to list them all and then what about all cause mortality risk so giant study about 9 million people this is a risk of death from all causes verse the alkaline phosphatase level so the red constraint is big 39 to 117 i really don't know if you're just looking at reference rate which which way is optimal so what we can see is that all cause mortality rate starts to pass one once you pass around 48 units per liter so based on that one could say that as close to 48 is is optimal and resisting an age-related increase for alkaline phosphatase it should also be suggested so list white blood cells which increased during aging and higher values are associated with a shorter life expectancy so this is data from the baltimore longitudinal study on aging where they again they measure this since the same subject for up to or long more than 40 years and what we can see is when looking at white blood cells and this is the the time prior to their death so we can see that for for those subjects that white blood cells increase for the 20 or so period 20 or so year period up to death and then how does that associate with life expectancies so this we're looking at survival and the y-axis versus time and the reference range for white blood cells is large and it doesn't tell you what's often so in looking at survival that may tell us more about what could be optimal so you look at 50% survival that you can you can kind of predict life expectancy based on that so we're looking at that the group that had the longest life expectancy had a white blood cell count between 3,500 and 6,000 cells per microliter and you see that here so starting from the measurement time measurement they lived about 38 years that group that had white blood cells at baseline at that level so what about a higher level actually what about lower levels so lower than 35 are actually the worst on the list they only live 22 years so you know making sure that your white blood cells are in this range i mean that's a 15 year difference in life expectancy it's a big deal so what about higher in 6,000 6,000 10,000 cells per microliter so their life expectancy is better than the less than 3500 but still not as good obviously as the 3,500 to 6,000 so they live about five years shorter than the best group and then greater than 10,000 they lived second shortest so they live about 25 years but still 13 years less than the group that had white blood cells in the 3500 to 6000 age so just as a quick what can optimize it this is just a study from biosphere 2 where the subjects that were wouldn't were involved ended up having to calorie restrict and there larger studies to illustrate this but i think the picture here is really quick and easy so they started off with white blood cells somewhere on the seven range and because they were calorie restricting or eating less calories than they normally would their white blood cell counts came very quickly down to somewhere in the low fours and then once they left last year too they returned to the normal type calorie in takes and we can see that it increased again and then they took that you know self adjusted and cut their calories again and then we see it coming down again so white blood cells may be sensitive to changes in calorie intake the but for me i have weak correlations between my calorie intake but for others this may be a worthwhile try so as i mentioned i posted all the reference ranges in the beginning but after going through all the data i'd suggest that all everything i've put here and we've talked about you know these numbers as potentially being an optimal range so just some notes if anyone's interested in more information about optimizing these variables i have lit up relatively brief literature reviews but without a scene or citations and more references for each of these biomarkers on my website and then it's important to note that some biomarkers may be easier to modify for diet exercise or supplements fitness or other means than others for example for me i'd say that you know i mean you go c-reactive protein creatinine and white blood cells may be easier to modify versus the others and this is a continuous trial thought process continuous trial and error process you know to think that you could just do it once and have a perfect i'd argue that that that's not the case and that's all i got thanks for your attention and take any questions yeah big thanks to their to the boston police department to get out to to them thanks for that guys oh dear it's always the way isn't it there's always somebody with an alarm yeah boss those terrible for that it's you know they've got a catch or do whatever yeah it's loud loud city yeah i i would have thought it had been a bit quieter with with isolation and lockdown at the moment i don't know what the situation is yeah i think boston yes it just i'm on a major street so that's probably what it is but uh you know the traffic on the major streets is gonna be louder especially if the police were i live across the street from the fire department so that's always interesting yeah so yeah i can appreciate that where we used to live was right by the city hospital so it was constantly sirens going off and all sorts and everybody used to think i lived in the high-crime area it's just that we happen to be here the back of the next street and obviously all the ambulances leaving yeah so there we go all right so we've got questions the correlation between age and the nine biomarkers is the same in different populations yeah that's a good point for example the glucose data was in a korean population but i mean at least for glucose that the data is similar you know regardless of geography whether it's european or north american it's pretty most of these biomarkers are pretty standard across geography and ethnicity um yeah okay tools for data collection so i'm just using an excel file and i just log everything in that and then i'm just for now i'm just using simple correlations in excel and in other cases multivariable regression models but also in excel so instead of just looking at correlations between individual you know dietary variables sometimes i'll add a few dietary variables together to build a model to see if the model is better than the individual variable at predicting the the biomarker so simple correlations for now i've i've had talks with people to use a machine learning approach and i've talked about this before especially the leaf conference last year if anybody wanted to help me use a machine learning approach but the people that have reached out to me and that i've reached out to have basically said that i need a ton more data than just and i say just 1800 days of dietary data and in 20 something blood tests so yeah we do have people involved in machine learning so we may be able to plug you in as it were in silico medicine comes to mind they are doing a lot of work with machine learning deep learning yeah yeah i reached out to parley about crunching the numbers between my diet and biomarkers but i don't think they were interested at that time and had far less data that time - yes polly polly - inna yes let's see calling white blood cell count a biomarker is very misleading it's not me that's calling it the biomarker i mean morgan levine you know they used an unbiased approach and came up identified the variables that best predicted biological age so that's one of them so i mean it's included on her biological age calculator phenotypic gauge which is almost perfectly correlated with chronological age so you know calling it a biomarker is you don't think that's a far stretch um and i wouldn't call it a crude way to measure immune health - because you know they increase during aging they increase during infection now he said that from steve steve you said that not all white blood cells are the same like then we have you know a point of agreement because within white blood cells the two main components in terms of how many cells are there or neutrophils and lymphocytes neutrophils increase during aging and actually the sites go the other way to decrease during aging so i also track my neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio which i would have argued would be a better metric and total white blood cells especially when considering that they go in opposite directions during aging but morgan levine and others that have used these clinical variables haven't looked at the image results in lymphocyte ratio as a potential variable for biological age i don't know i i would say that he is actually a fair biomarker to be honest it is indicative of something but you know arguable point i suppose did anybody in here have a question i meant to ask if anybody has the question do you feel free to raise your hand or or or put it in the text if any any of us here on the call would like to ask mark a question if not we've got quite a lot of things coming in from facebook as well so you gonna be popular this afternoon might see anybody for a question him in nothing yeah well there's a load of questions in the in the text there for yeah yeah so adrian see yeah i did i did so i did plot um fat intake versus creatinine i don't remember it off off the top of my head but um yeah i'm gonna go back and look at it after we're done i don't know that it's the fat intake though but but and i also have the you know potential renal acid load so you know the foods that you eat the amount of acid that your kidneys would see as a potential variable for resulting an increase creatinine levels which was suggest decreased kidney function i also you know track that too so you know it could be the eggs and cheese because they you know they have a lot of variables that increase the potential renal acid load but i'm gonna go back and take another look at that and see what it is but regardless of what the reason would be whether it's eggs and cheese or something else for me well all i care about is getting my biomarkers to go in the right direction so i noticed that reducing them they go back to the right direction and if i eat increase them then they go back to you know in the wrong direction so you tony yeah i had looked into senescence cells i'd say the field is probably at least a few years of including that into biological age calculators mostly because they aren't widely tested for so um you know you may have small studies you know relatively small studies in terms of the amount of subjects and study that have senescence cell marker measurements but to have large studies like you know in haines and had 9 or 10,000 or 11,000 subjects i don't i don't think that data exists yet so i think it'll be at least a few years before there's large population data on that to be able to derive you know biological or it's included as a biological age marker other biological age clocks that i would consider as reference so i do use aging di i did use that but the correlation for aging di with its 19 or up to i think 31 biomarkers its correlation at best was somewhere in the 0.8 range which isn't as good as obviously 0.94 296 of morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator so i i've placed most of my analysis on the phenotypic age i got a bunch of questions so when is too late to change biological age never whenever you the active tracking will improve your biological age sooner but it's hopefully sooner than later but eventually um and i say that not just with my diet but i also track my fitness levels in terms of resting heart rate and heart rate variability these are things that also change with age and just by tracking them so i wear a fitness tracker just by tracking that daily for the last year and a half i've actually made improvements and resisted age-related changes there too so i'd say it's never li never too late to start the more you track the better you'll be able to figure out what works best for optimizing you know your engine your car and that should reduce biological agent risk of disease i mean it's tough you know you're great with your grandmother i mean you want to obviously you'd want to you want to make very small changes and i would only change no obvious things like diet i wouldn't add supplements or drugs unless she has to take medications you know because of advanced age but you know simple simple low-risk strategies you know whether it's changing a certain food or eating more of another food whether it's more fiber or more nutrient density these are low risk strategies that could potentially yield greater rewards or even that you know adding a little you know a little extra walking you know these are small small small steps can lead to great gains so and i'd say it's never too late thoughts on calicoes looking for longevity didn't some man that's uh i don't want to lose my nice where i'm at this is family show yeah yeah yeah i don't want to say anything negative they're doing a lot of work on on model organisms and looking at your longevity genes or trance translate ability to humans is very debatable but i'd say that the more people looking at longevity gene is the better keep it keep it like that yeah i mean you know the case for longevity genes isn't isn't fantastic i think there was there were a few like clotho or clothes also mice or three a there's a few genes associated with like the sirtuins this or two in that work as well yeah how big how big a variance in age you know life expectancy that equates to a lot of people seem to think it's not going to be that significant along those lines to let's say you don't have those longevity genes or others right so what are we supposed to do know oh i don't have longevity genes so i guess i'm just gonna you know burn my candle at both ends who cares because i don't have longevity genes i'd argue that whatever whatever your your dna is in terms of your maximal lifespan whether that's 115 or it's 95 by optimizing as much as you can optimize to get the most out of your genes that's my approach so i don't have i don't i don't have longevity genes so i'm trying to squeeze or at least not yet what it hasn't you know been evident yet in my family so mmm i would say epigenetics my probably has a greater effect on your on your lifespan than anything else you know the environmental factors by influencing gene expression yep rather than the genes that you've got per se i certainly don't subscribe to the idea that there are death genes yeah are out to get you because i think i just actually think that about ideas absurd i mean we're not salmon yeah yeah and along those lines well i mean no there are different papers that are you know shown that actually longevity is a balance between how many longevity genes in you know life license shortening genes you have but but i agree with you about the epigenetic aging and it along those lines in the horvath group their papers that have looked at epigenetic age and relationship with diet or exercise actually it's exactly as you would predict you know people who had exercise and had better physical activity had a younger epigenetic age the people who ate more basically fruits and vegetables and that higher carotenoids lit circulating carotenoids one of them being beta carotene which is associated with albumin had a younger epigenetic age so there is some overlap there to beta-carotene isn't that found in carrots and similar vegetables carrots sweet potatoes i've cut down on the carrots and replaced it with sweet potatoes to get the same amount of beta-carotene but yeah i could try to have more variety well now you mentioned sweet potatoes which are really really tasty the only thing is that comes to mind with those is that they're they're a simple carb a bit like potatoes and i'm i'm sort of other thought there you need to keep ugi as as sort of low as possible so that you've got a steady blood sugar yeah and things like sweet potatoes and potatoes and similar tuber vegetables can actually cause you obviously a spike in you in your room in your glucose any thoughts on that i mean you know yeah so so in terms of carrots actually they do have a lot of sugar whether its fructose or superoes compared to sweet potatoes which basically don't have any so that that isn't your fair point but carrots have a lot of soluble fiber in which is fermented but you know we're not going to get into it today but they're solid fiber density so the amount of soluble fiber that they have per 100 calories compared to a sweet potato is greater so they may i'd argue they may be more beneficial for the gut microbiome but it's a it's a you know it's it's a you know two eggs of one or two eggs of the other right so carrots have more sugar but more but also more soluble fiber whereas the sweet potatoes have less sugar and last slide the fiber but other things that can also affect the microbiome so i mean it's also how they're prepared obviously because you know cooking vegetables you can cause them to rise in in in their gi their gi can go up if you cook them as opposed to them being raw so raw carrots are okay but if you cook it soon as you start cooking them whoa hello blows okay you know so there's another there's another metric there in in all of us don't have the same response blood sugar response to foods and that that study was you know aaron aaron siegel's group they showed that not everybody responds to a white bread meal in terms of blood sugar rise so whereas i may have and i haven't done this experiment yet but at some point i want to get a continuous blood glucose meter you know stick it to my arm and see how individual foods affect my blood sugar levels but yeah it's variable right i mean but i also argue that whether you're eating carrots or sweet potatoes and their potential effects on gi these are gonna be far better than eating you know processed refined foods right so yeah so that's good news if you if you like your salad folks all right let's hear biomarkers to reduce cross-linking um that's the big question i mean yeah i'd argue that you know optimal body composition and a nutrient dense diet just because so when i think about collagen cross-linking or cross-linking in the ecm i think about oxidation i think about glycation and these are things that would be minimized being basically lean and fit and eating a nutrient-dense diet now if you want to ask me for more specifics on terms of you know whether it's glucose glucose of pain or other other nosema lytx i'm not there yet but that's definitely on my list is to eventually jump into that and you know so i can only delay aging for as long as possible there's gonna come a point where no matter what dietary change or how fit i am we're gonna need these rejuvenation you know therapies so yeah that's on my list not there yet though well span demand for glucose the pain involved it's also popping on the previous question that tony had asked him it was the biomarkers for themselves the thing is that in the human body the only thing that one of the only things you have easy access to is of course to blood so we are kind of limited in what we can look for and assassin cells are not floating around in the blood and there are not really any biomarkers in the blood that really reflect the amount of senescence cells in your body you could say sighs and cells secrete inflammatory factors but that's mostly a queen the environment so i don't really get much in the blood anyway measuring inflammatory markers in the blood will make more reflect other things that also cause inflammation in the blood like you know if you have any type of infections or you know your gut microbiome that increases inflammation inflammation so there is not anything in the blood that you can measure that really reflects less themselves easily and kind of the same applies to glycation or cross-linking of the extra solid matrix there of course your blood glucose levels will be important your age vibha me sea level which reflects like your long term because level in your blood will be important but that all looks at glucose and there are other factors that do cross linking like metals like cell for example which is way more reactive and which really can mesh in your blood so we certainly are limited in but we can measure us by your marcus in an easy accessible way good he's right you know yeah three points manji we did work on glucose a pain so he's got a home advantage you know you worked at david spiegel's lab didn't you for a while yes so he is mr. Cross links so we're fortunate to have him here with us today yes all right let's go to more questions here so the difference in subjective well-being / performance yes definitely a hundred percent as i mentioned at least in terms of physical performance my strength is pretty good i dream i posted a couple videos on youtube we do pull-ups and shoulder presses so i'm still pretty strong that hasn't changed and i've improved my cardiovascular fitness as evidenced by my lower resting heart rate and higher heart rate variability subjective well-being i'm always working on improving that i think i can always feel better but uh you know attract my sleep so i'm always trying to improve you know the amount of deep sleep that i get and having consistent some time so i'm obsessed with optimal physical physical and mental health condition and you know there were times in my life where i ate more processed foods and less nutrient-dense diets and you know i'm not gonna say i feel outstanding i feel pretty good um you know everybody would love to be chronologically 20 so but yeah for my chronological age i'd say good pretty good and the performance is there too right so but always room for improvement um what changes in diet over 65 um well yeah i'd argue that yes and that may be the group that would need dietary changes the most i've got a grant it submission right now that's gonna look at a high-fiber diet in older adults to see how it affects their muscle muscle related measures muscle mass composition physical function um so uh yeah i'd argue that yeah and there is plenty of data that older adults eat nutrient poor diets yeah so um but yeah there are a few studies that have looked at you know no nutrient dense whole food based diets in that age group so yeah i'd argue that older adults would need uh you know better diets across the board so for tomas in terms of reading why i'd say to look up some more papers on biological age i mean we just went through how to optimize it but for more background i can go to you know morgan levine's papers or other other papers epigenetic page for vets group you know maybe it's not pure biological age it's it's a it's a it's a it's a i've people have argued with me i'm not that they think it's not really biological age but that it correlates with chronological age indeed indicates that it is a measure of a cumulative measure of biological age nonetheless let's say let's say that these this panel of nine bar mark biomarkers isn't a measure or biological agent i mean granted it's associated with all cause mortality risk so that's important but one of the you know main points of my presentation was that you know how did these things change the age and what's associated with biological youth so you know even if someone doesn't want to identify them as a quote-unquote biological marker of age how you're circulating markers of health change during aging and with disease risk and optimizing them so we get closer to biological youth and lower disease risk so whatever you want to call that biological age marker or or what i'd say that's important so so whether that's an indicator of health span you know yeah okay so in terms of inflammation so for steve i only have eight or nine crp measurements right now so you know even though it seems like a lot of data it's easy to have very strong or very weak correlations so stay tuned on how am i see rp associates with other biomarkers but i have up to 25 measurements for glucose abdomen and a standard chemistry panel so yeah i do indeed look for correlations between within stuff that's usually found on a blood test to potentially give me more insight at times to figure out how i can optimize them again it's not actually on me to be it's me it's me typing it in the chat i'm copying and based in it from facebook and i'm putting the pearson's name at the front so it's definitely not all me i haven't asked all these questions today might yeah yeah i see it now rare and my fault so um yeah i'm a big fan of greg fakies approach and that he wanted to optimize biological age but not to not to sound negative just to be objective they achieved only a two and a half year reduction in biological age using that combination hgh metformin you know etc just this you know just just from last year you know so last year i think i had three or four phenotypic age measurements and as i mentioned i started at 35 something years old 35 points for thirty five point six when i was 46 so already i started off ten years younger than my chronological and just looking at the four dead blood tests from last year you get the two or three that i have this year i'm three years 2 to 3 years younger and purposefully i've reduced my body weight i've changed my diet optimize my fitness so you could make the argument that you don't need it for say for someone that was already crying a lot biologically younger than their chronological age you can make further gains by changing lifestyle related stuff of the same magnitude that the drugs used so um but the point about thymosin pollution is a good one steve and i talked about this before too it's it's a huge especially in the age of coronavirus getting that thymus rejuvenated and cells that are able like you know whether it also he mckee maddow police's so we've got more immune cells whether they're t cells b cells or other lymphocytes to fight off infectious agents it's essential so that that's a billion dollar question if we had the answer to regenerating the thymus and boosting immune cell production that can help our you know antiviral defense i mean it would be everywhere but it's in my mind you know so the vegetarian data is tricky because there i've seen data that goes both ways i've seen data that compares vegetarians to omnivores and they're the same in terms of outcome variables and or not so i think it goes deeper than just you know what's your which are dietary ideologies i should say from ariela that you know i tried going vegan almost pretty close ravi and i presented this and at other times in other presentations some went raw vegan essentially pretty close to it for about a year and my triglycerides went up and hdl went down so these are things that are going in the wrong direction that's these are basically age-related changes that have basically by basically these diet to cause and then once i had it fish back in those went back to normal so clearly being vegan isn't optimal for my biochemistry um and then even going forward i've played around with how much beef cheese and eggs to add in and then you know i saw for me those it's minimum you know once a week once a month but for others maybe they would have better biomarkers on those diets but then also interesting lis red blood cells decrease with age which is a problem because if you have left last red blood cells to carry hemoglobin to carry oxygen you're gonna feel exhausted all the time you're not gonna have enough oxygen to perform cellular work and my red blood cells for a few years we're trending downward and i wasn't able to see values that i had seen 15 years ago so i was almost you know admitting to myself well i'm trying everything i can do and i don't see anything improving this why don't you know what am i gonna do i guess i'm on that road for age-related decline and for whatever reason i added full fat plain yogurt into my diet and whether that caused it or not i haven't seen red blood cell levels that are lower than five which is what's found in biological youth whereas for 15 or so blood test measurements i was never able to get them out of for seven reache so so it's variable it may be variable for everyone out i don't want to say eat go vegetarian or vegan or omnivore carnivore i mean if you've got blood tests results across the board not just an isolated biomarker not just your glucose levels are greater here tg to hdl level is great if you can show across the board that your biomarkers are good and you have little information in ramon biological age whatever that dietary ideology may be go for that ha ha the best foods to support the micro is producing short chain fatty acids uh i'm fiber soluble fiber and to most people that conjures up an image of whole grains and that's not true and the reason that that's not true is because if you look at the size of fiber content for whole grains as they're listed by serving size they have more than vegetables but vegetables are more nutrient dense but calorie poor so for the same hundred calories for if you compare 100 grams of whole grains and pick your whole-grain oats rice barley whatever it may be a hundred grams of the whole grain versus hundred grams of vegetable the vegetable has more soluble fiber problem is almost no study well only a few studies have looked at very high vegetable diets in terms of their ability to increase short chain fatty acid levels and i'm actually working on a grant now that i'm gonna submit in june that goes after that idea and older adults but if you're looking to support your microbes high-fiber diet but even there there's some variability i at one point i was averaging over 100 grams a day i've been playing around with 80 grams a day to see how that affects some stuff and i may go back to a very high fiber diet but uh even that's variable finding the fiber amount that works best for you yeah is individual jeans affect lifespan that's very simplistic all jeans are not necessarily involved in metabolism i mean that's i mean i hate to say it have you seen the biochemistry chart with all the interconnected pathways i mean that's that's what i think of as an answer it's so comprehensive but uh what i just said would be an argument for not using nine biomarkers as an index of biological age but the argument against that is the nine biomarkers that are on levene's phoenix a phenotypic age calculator had been studied in terms of aging and disease risk the 50 to 100 years or more where as you know the human genome was first sequence in 2001 so we've got about 20 years of data on genes and even less data on epidemiological studies for genes that are associated with aging or lifespan anything disease risk so um you know i tend to favor the data there's way more data on what's on the phenotypic a phenotypic age calculator in terms of how should how how do these variables change with agent disease risk compared to the genes which could be all over the place or not even did not have any data yet actionable data a gut microbiota have not checked my own um in about two years maybe you buy um close down so i happened on my own since then but it's tricky with the microbiome because i think it's easy to get caught up on is my microbiome optimal without looking at the blood test stuff so for now i'm completely focused on my on my circulating biomarkers but if you know if i if i found something that was resistant to change in my circulating biomarkers then i may want to look deeper you know go to the microbiome or you know go to even individual nutrient levels like circulating folate or circulating you know something to get more insight you know to do with metabolites but so far i don't think i need to do that yeah i was never i was never really looking at the link between the gut microbiota and biological age you know but a big part of my hypothesis is that microbiome does have and there's a lot of data that supports it that the microbiome has a big impact on aging [music] you know i'd like to say i'm on the right track because i see the chronological age being relatively low so there are other people are looking at the gut microbiota gut microbiome as a predictor of biological age but you know i'd like to see i'd like to see you know their diet in there and their physical activity levels these are all things that can affect the gut microbiome so i think definitely need more studies on on that it's an aunt of dramatically under study topic blue zones so um there's this you know blue zones give incredible height to the idea that centenarians in part get there by nutrient dense diets and i hate to say but they couldn't be further from the truth there are some longevity related societies you know in italy for example that do eat more fruits and vegetables and in whole grains and then other long-lived societies but from the from my study of the literature yeah you know i'd say the older you get the actually the worse the worse the diet is and i argue that most people get to 100 110 don't get there because of their diets at all but you know i it because because many so many aren't getting there based on their diet that would potentially leave room for improvement so what the the idea of the blue zones that you know let's eat these nutrient-dense diets i'm all for it and that doesn't mean a vegan or vegetarian more nutrient density you know can't be a bad thing now it could be true that the blue zones are eating less processed and refined foods because of reading more nutrient-dense and you've cut out the junk that could be a contributing factor so how much longer would we all live if we we cut down on the junk food ernie or nutrient dense foods longevity and location yeah i don't think i don't think longevity i know people can argue that longevity has an impact on it i mean if you're living in the north pole and you're freezing to death every day and maybe like i don't know i mean there's this day it'll support heat shock proteins so if you are getting their frozen every day but not dying you might even live longer yeah could right but uh that's variable right how about this how about this if your ancestors you evolved for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years in europe but now you live in a temperate zone like so your genes are adapted to the colder climates but now you're living in a climate that your genes are not adapted for that may reduce your longevity and conversely right if you're if you've evolved in a warm temperate climate and now you're in a cold environment that your genes are not evolutionarily adapted for that i argue it may not be but it's so much speculation right i have seen people you know i have seen studies talking about the impact of geography on longevity and there are indeed villages where it seems like longevity genes are concentrated but as a broader geography like a you know a country i'm not so sure it latitude/longitude not so sure now he showed if you showed me that you know tsarskoe v2 had a greater impact in the winter in the northern latitudes and a lesser impact in the southern latitudes and in the in the in the you know in the winter months okay maybe because that would directly impact you know your longevity so but uh i mean it's speculation hmm i mean there's certainly some day affair using saunas and things i saw yeah ron patrick was covering that a recently soreness and i'm gonna feel in hot tubs as well so yeah again you know that's the heat shock proteins and there's some good data for that yeah so thinking in there finland don't they em they have the sauna and then they sit and sweat for an hour and then they go outside and roll in the snow yeah i mean i'd see i've seen the sauna data and i'm not i'm not you know knocking it at all but so exercise when you exercise you get your core body temperature up and if it's hot enough you'll sweat so you're getting your heat shock proteins activated now is the sauna you know it's a sauna data in sedentary people of a certain bmi who don't exercise who do exercise i think there's a lot of a lot of factors there now if you showed me data that the sauna reduces inflammation and improves these biomarkers i haven't seen that data yet but i mean it's a low-risk strategy right um but uh yeah but even the up but even the opposite side you know the cryotherapy for three minutes standing in the - 80 foot or colder for three minutes i'm not sure that that stuff is doing anything regardless of you know whatever few publications that are out there and these things are a cold shower i can i can see that you know evolutionarily we may have you know jump in cold ponds where it you know doing that maybe for maybe millions of years but um - 200 degrees fahrenheit on the accurate yeah don't fancy that to be honest yeah but we are getting a hot tub i think soon so i could deal what i could do in a one-person the experiment my money in my bios sounds good very good what's the pre and post blood test data or even you know it may be even short-term right maybe sauna improves you know glucose response where you're better able to metabolize glucose it could be just you know short-term acute effects of it and and speaking of how to monitor that i miss jacobs has asked on facebook what should what are your thoughts on the wearable monitors i have my own am i gonna shout out who because they don't sponsor me but if you see my wrist or i guess yeah i'm a big fan of wearable metrics where the monitors line does resting heart rate heart rate variability and then sleep stages i don't think there are other products that do more than that in terms of fitness variables maybe more than that in terms of you can listen to you you know music or something but i don't need any of that um mmm and since i started tracking in august 2018 so about a year and a half tracking my cardiovascular metrics the resting heart rate heart rate variability like i said i changed i changed my whole workout approach i was training like once every three or four days for two or three hours at a time lifting heavy all the time and i was killing my uh-huh metric my cardiovascular health metrics my heart rate variability went down and resting heart rate was higher than it is now so um yeah that i'm tracking my fitness i'm tracking my diet i have a blood pressure cuff i tracked that too there may be stuff in my diet that affects it so i i'm constantly tweaking that to optimize the blood pressure too so uh yeah i'm trying to track as much stuff as possible so yeah although iris is apparently talking about ones that can actually assess blood composition oh yeah mmm we're not sort of that's getting into hardcore proper medical devices rather than you know a lot the fitness and lifestyle where lifestyl wearables although they are getting more sophisticated as well aren't they yeah i don't know that i don't know that the wearable would ever get i mean when you take a blood sample and you can do a full metabolomic analysis on that for wearable to do that i mean maybe you've got a few you know biomarkers that the wearable could check and glucose would be relatively easy but to have the full panel you know to do a full metabolomic of chemicals like you could do with a blood sample with a mass spectrometer you can't have the mass spectrometer on your wrist that's we don't exist doesn't exist yet maybe at some point in the future right but uh you know i'm not even close yeah i mean that how i would envisage that it would be done would be that you would ingest or implant somewhere within the bloodstream and some kind of sensors you know for glucose and various things and then that would wirelessly link up to a monitor either on your wrist or or or a nearby computer i could i can obviously see that being done yeah and you know achievable in the next few years so you could then look at your metabolites in real time which would be really interesting yeah but then you'd also have to make sure that whatever you're swallowing wasn't adversely affecting you know and it was benign in terms of you affecting your system you notice in the physiology right i don't know how easy that would be i mean i like the idea though obviously yeah i mean you know it's it's all part of the quantifiable self so if you've got real-time telemetry coming in you can you can adjust it for maximum performance yeah the matrix really in there yeah like yeah i like the bond yeah i mean you think the idea of quantified self you'd see more people tracking there's you know stemming physiology or circulating block chemistry and i don't hardly see any of that i see people tracking their mood and you know world productivity i mean anyway i guess i want the world to track you know track their metrics of health improve the health of the world the physical i haven't focused on bloodletting for and already there i guess there's some data where if you if you if you donate blood that can reduce your circulating iron levels which can be beneficial for health but in terms of longevity i haven't been looked into that you and then it turns the enzyme question for john i mean that's it that could be a genetics question right if you have a gene for a certain protein or certain enzyme and someone's got a you know one letter difference in that gene to have a different protein that has a slightly less or more functional effect then i guess that gets at that so that's a genetics question well i mean i think that the majority of the amino acids in the protein which is of course the active site and if you mutation there it will change the functionality of your enzyme quite a lot but in most cases unless it of course interferes with the normal folding of your protein it has very little effect most of these mutations and of course it is possible to make a mutation in an enzyme that would make enzyme better but of course also depends on what does that mean of course is it necessary for the enzyme to have a higher rate of catalytic conversion of your substrate is that necessary right i mean is that better maybe in some cases in all the cases it will not be better so it's there is no answer to that question and then if that enzyme is at the center of a node that controls the activity of hundreds or thousands of other proteins okay making changes in that one protein one way or the other right like positive or negative could impact hundreds of thousands of proteins but i don't know how many proteins that would be truthful right like maybe m tori if you you know mess with them - i mean there are a few proteins but there are so many animal models where you knock out a gene or you know or overexpress it and doesn't do anything to the systemic physiology you know so but yeah i get your point i'm even m tour's not completely straightforward as some people think it is as well so you got talk one and talk to the different the two different complexes and everyone was assuming that two was bad and one was good but it's too reductionist accord some new data coming in to do with rapamycin again needs it's it's absolutely not clear and this is the problem when you go so far downstream and you start tinkering with metabolism nothing nothing at all works in isolation so it's very hard when you've drilled down straight to actually say whether anything is definitively good or bad and it's all about i mean one thing i learned from irina come boy was everything is well everything there's a potential to be harmful or beneficial depending on the context and the levels at which it is so like tgf-beta for example everyone goes our tgf-beta it's bad it's bad it's bad yeah but you need it because we didn't have any you're being real trouble so it's all about calibrating and this the further you drill down into the details the more difficult it gets to control it so yes true to point to to chew so that we got one about magnets am i my any thoughts on that filtering blood out with magnets in that one i don't know about filtering it with magnets but there are labs that are attempting to filter out pathogens and i'm all for that i mean there there are a few studies that have shown that microbial burden in the blood goes up with age so yeah whether it's magnets i mean if there are good studies that show that what magnets can do it or some other device i'm all for that yeah you know it's the idea of blood filtering these is a solid idea you know filtering out on what elements i'm gonna talk about my rena convoy again she's obviously work here and michael are working on calibrating various regulatory molecules in the blood like master regulators tgf-beta tnf-alpha and il-6 few of those is a handful of things at the top of the pyramid that she thinks controls a lot of stuff underneath so her idea is to actually use it's a little bit like dialysis and i think it's plasma species plus mysterious i can't say that word but they feel that's it they feed it for a membrane and it's able to isolate these particular molecules that they're down one and of course that in animal studies that they've done it in they've demonstrated rejuvenation so there's every reason to think if you pick the right things and calibrate them correctly you could resort in the result could be rejuvenation and famous senescence cells if you could fish those out of the bloodstream all the sas factors and and tamp them down to the level that they should be at when you're younger again one would expect rejuvenation or resumption of tissue maintenance the only we know that homes yeah yeah the only issue that i had with that approach is that uh that assumes that why they were produced by those molecules when it was tgf-beta or other molecules why they're produced in the first place what's the root right so i mean it's a i see some of that with the kovetz story you know people talking about the side of counsel and let's treat the cytokine storm what's the root right the root is the cytokine storm is there to signal to the immune system to make more immune cells but because the person can't make more immune cells that it's a positive feedback loop of a higher site cytokine storm so you know i i find it interesting especially at least even in animal models that microbe we burn in the blood increases during aging whether it's lps or ndp so i find it interesting that you know the convent group hasn't decided to filter out microbes or microbial products yet and potentially that would lead to reductions in some of the you know inflammatory molecules whether it's tgf-beta or inflammatory molecules and higher amounts they should be there and it's also just impractical to do this type of filtering viruses i mean you know because whatever you're trying to filter out will increase normally again if you don't take away the cause of it so then every few weeks you will have to go to hospital and later a machine that filters your blood for hours on end and there are people who do that it's being done plasmapheresis for example for people who have very high levels of lipoprotein certain like proteins when they have inherited - leukemia diseases but i mean it's it's very practical it's not pleasant to go to hospital and they therefore for so many always once or twice a moment and it's also very expensive obviously good good points my average blood pressure so going back to adrienne my average blood pressure is 120 over 70 ish which can be better so yeah i'm working on that what about ketones i don't track ketones so the ketone story goes back to there's a lot of ways to fry fish and in terms of ketosis and longevity so yes a high-fat aqui i've seen data on a ketogenic diet improving lifespan and mice but the magnitude of the lifespan on ketogenic diet and mice isn't what was found on just a cr just at you know comparing a cr group versus adlib without being in ketosis so but in terms of the ketosis story i mean if you can show that you've you know down low inflammation and all the other biomarkers on a standard chem panel and cbc are good and youthful i mean you know there's a lot of ways to skin a cat so if getting into ketosis and eating a high-fat diet works for you along those lines and you know i'm all for it i haven't measured ketosis to answer richards question but i bet that i have a lot of ketone bodies because eating a high-fiber diet leads to a higher production of the short chain fatty acid butyrate and that's one step away from hydroxylation to full-on beta-hydroxybutyrate which is a ketone so there's a lot of ways to get to the same end point yeah we all like butyrate because obviously sales like kelowna sights again about 70% of their energy from from that from those short chain fatty-acids and i know that some people try and claim that leaky gut they suggest that leaky gut is is wu and you know it's pseudoscience i actually think the pictures changing on that as the data comes in you know the actual membrane integrity of the intestines is definitely compromised as you get older and there is there is considerable day and now to suggest there the change is in the bacterial populations in the microbiome or a very instrumental in that happening so like like the colano sites that rely on butyrate and you know those sorts of things it's the microbiome it's been overlooked for years mike and it's now starting to get the recognition it deserves is it the origin point of inflammation yeah i think there's a good case for it yeah i wouldn't say it's the origin point but it's definitely a contributing factor i cuz i know you've talked about this before but even in the absence of a microbiome germ-free mice are an immortal so there is endogenous cell aging that's independent of the microbiome right so what as don bonuses paper a couple years ago showed you know there's a vicious cycle so there with the gut microbiome changes are it so when you consider the germ-free finding right there is indeed endogenous cell aging in the absence of a microbiome there are also got microbiome changes compositionally with aging - and that ends up leading to the vicious cycle of of increased inflammation further worsen microbiome further increased inflammation so but at that on top of this cellular changes during aging or you know for ourselves so uh yeah it's definitely a component how much i mean you know even if it's only 10 percent i mean that's ten percent you can optimize your lifespan ten percent on one hundred and twenty year lifespan is twelve years i'll take that so and most people most people aren't even considering how to optimize their microbiome so uh yeah it's important it is important it's definitely a case for in terms of lunge every years well where they looked at there was a study in japan last year you i'm sure you've seen there where they looked at people that lived over a hundred and they compared a range of microbiomes and they found that the super ages the people at a hundred and hundred and ten their microbiomes was you know similar to people in their 30s and 40s which is you know that's significant you know people have tended to age well had a much much more i'm gonna say youthful microbots basis so they did in some ways but the other studies that i've seen centenarians and their microbiomes and actually some of the metabolic products that besides the short chain fatty acids that are produced by the mic file or higher in scenario so for example eric ries all sulfate is one of those metabolites and other one was phenol at cl glutamine and the the study that i have in my mind they were calling those metabolites which are produced only by other gut microbiome well actually phenol see the glutamine is produced in conjunction with us so we conjugate it it's a glutamine so anyway fema without coordinates and mechanism just long story short they're derived from got microbiome metabolism but anyway they're finding that it was higher in the centenarians the study authors suggested that these were prolong jeffie metabolites however um these are known uremic toxins meaning if you have kidney failure they're elevated in the blood so how do you reconcile those two those two findings i'd argue that centenarians have got microbes that produce these things that aren't good for health but then they have others probably they have better short chain fatty acid producing bacteria and more short chain fatty acids that are similar to people who are at a younger age right so the good outweigh the bad but yeah it i just think it's funny because i see a lot of centenarians studies and they'll say things like that or they'll call these known metabolites that that aren't you know that are bad for health and they'll call them for longevity metabolites well it it couldn't be farther from the truth well you know everyone's everyone's got their little pet pet subject somebody but yeah i mean i think of anything it shows there's a strong case for eating more fiber yeah definitely as one part of it you know because even the fiber supplementation studies uh you know cuz i get that too like should i just take fiber minimis or or whatever i you know because i'm working on a grant i had to do a lit review basically on you know the individual fiber supplements and most of the time they don't even raise short chain fatty-acids levels which you would predict you know if you're taking sixteen grams or twenty grams of a fiber supplement and that's 16 grams of just it's gonna get fermented by the gut bacteria in the short chains that's what the gut bacteria do and you see no effect i mean i think that's important right so but yet on a whole food diet with a similar 15 or 20 gram increase you see increases in the short chain so there's something about the whole food in the you know being together in a food matrix combined with potentially other nutrients whether it's polyphenols or what that uh you know further maximizes and got microbiome you know independent of just taking fiber as a supplement and actually to in mice there's one study where they gave soluble fiber by itself as a supplement and the mice ended up having a greater incidence of liver cancer so you know this isn't happening in people thought you know maybe it's an effect specific to mice but it shows that just taking a food component outside of it existing in food may not be good for how so there is some date if a beer a supplementation reason uh no they're not in old people hmm but you know that could be a case of that they're the populations of bacteria that use it are not they're not present in high numbers as they are in youth so i mean you've got to have the bacteria in order to process there the nutritional substances haven't you so it you can put as much fiber in but if you've not got the bacteria that process in that fiber so again that's another argument for seeding the gut with optimal microbes again and we look you know i'm surprised somebody hasn't mentioned it already today but probiotics you know that always comes up where do you stand on that and the answer is well we don't really know enough about probiotics yet to really say fecal transplants yeah maybe mmm so in terms of probiotics i mean my stance has always been get your gut microbiome sequence figure out what you think is missing or what you want to be there because it's variable right i mean you know to just say oh i don't have this species or i don't have this species i want to have this species and then i'm gonna add this species they exist as a community right so if you're adding one are you changing the community structure to make it better or worse and then you've also got the the factor of you know is the probiotic you're taking even gonna survive the acidity of the stomach i mean so not all not all probiotics are are designed like that so and then what's the dose that you would need to seed it if indeed that is something you want to seed your gut microbiome way so i think most people indiscriminately take probiotics without even thinking about it and then not only that they don't make they'll see they'll attempt to see their microbiome and then they won't add the prebiotics that those bugs like right so if you're seeding it with a bacteria that likes inulin and then you don't eat in ulan well you've basically wasted your money because the bog is just gonna get passed out of your colon so yeah i think there's a lot of factors that most people don't appreciate when it comes to probiotics of mutation i'm not currently to me any probiotics i attempted to seed my own with the fado bacteria a while ago and actually got him to go up higher than it was before but nowhere near you know other like for example known butyrate producer fatality bacterium prowse nietzsche i think i had like 40% of my gut microbiome is that species whereas the food bacteria i got it to less than 1% so does that make any difference systemically i mean i don't know right so but the burrito but the butyrate argument people i mean i so it besides diet diet isn't the only thing that can affect the short chain fatty acid producers in your gut exercise too and there's not a lot of data on this which is another reason i want to i'm going after in grants somehow exercise at least in in young adults led to the increase in short chain fatty acid producing bacteria and the content of short chain fatty-acids in the gut so how the hell is exercise which you're just moving your muscles how is that affecting affecting the composition of the of the gut microbiome and what is producing so there's only one study i know that there was a paper last year where they you know they used lactate did you see that paper they's lactate and the mice ran longer oh yeah so lactate is produced by the muscles during exercise so it increases after exercise so they postulated that it was metabolized into propionate which is also short chain fatty acid but it's not from that nobody's looked at it mechanistically actually think that exercise which is known to you know so you've got glycolysis and then the end product of glycolysis pyruvate so there are pyruvate degrading bacteria into acetate acetate is then converted into butyrate so nobody's gone after that hypothesis but that's i'm kicking around that idea in my head all the time you know don't ya so right that's only one side of story diet microbiome effects on health but then the other side is how is muscle or movement affecting the microbiome which in turn is further affecting muscle right so yeah we the basically focus is we don't know we don't know yet what these needed yes yeah standard answer isn't it in in in academia so oh we found this exciting thing out but most of the d definitely needed yeah yeah iris diet and exercise optimized the image of individual yes that that's associated or correlated with younger epigenetic age in the horvath group and morgan there's someone morgan levine's uh papers that she's on too so and yes diet and exercise is definitely a bridge whether that gets me ten years of extra life or thirty years of extra life knows but the the you know in terms of in terms of the importance of optimizing the fitness approach so exercise is well known i said this before exercise is well known to increase average lifespan in animal models but it doesn't increase maximum lifespan basically the gold standard increasing lifespan in animal models calorie restriction so when you consider the exercise data okay so if i live longer than average and the average lifespan for a man is 80 years and i get to 95 400 okay but i haven't gotten to 120 right so i would need some calorie restriction in there - but why should exercise get you an increase in average but not an increase in maximal is it possible that you're doing too much is it chronic stress as opposed to hormetic stress that's beneficial for lifespan i mean so that's that goes back to tracking the markers the fitness markers whether it's resting heart rate or heart rate variability these can tell you if you're over trained or you've got too much sympathetic activation and not enough parasympathetic activation which is an indicator of chronic stress so you know i'm trying to come up with the dose whether it's diet and exercise that can maximize everything now yes it is a bridge as i mentioned before we're gonna need rejuvenation tech and i hope that i can jump into that field eventually but unfortunately in science unless you start in rejuvenation tech like you're you're doing your phd program in rejuvenation tech then you do your postdoc in rejuvenation that way i didn't start in rejuvenation tech so i started an oxidative stress and then sarah metabolomic sand then they've got microbiome so i hope i can evolve my way into rejuvenation tech eventually but for me that's gonna be a longer journey there's someone who's actually been studying it their whole scientific career yes do you tie at this time of the day so i'm a big fan of i've become a big fan of time restricted feeding and i completely changed my diet in terms of what time of the day it may not affect my biomarkers because you know i'm i'm they're my biomarkers data the blood biomarker data is all under fasted conditions so you know after so i haven't done the study you know after i've eaten what am i bad biomarkers look like i don't know but i can tell you that a a couple years ago i was eating one meal a day i was on the one meal a day diet home at right i would fast all day i actually i'd drink green tea in the morning fast all day come home around 6:00 and then eat 2,000 or 2,500 calories whatever my maintenance calorie intake was at that time from 6 to 9 o'clock and i'd wake up every morning feeling like complete - completely terrible and it took me a while to even figure out why that would be and then once the feet the time restricted feeding studies were being wrong i shouldn't say once but once i became aware of them that um you know they improved measures of metabolic health by having the same amount of calories but at it you know eating them earlier in the day i completely flipped my eating schedule to eating the majority of my calories almost all of them earlier in the day and in fact now you know nothing now that we're all on quarantine i don't have to wait to eat the small amount that i have left in the day at 6 o'clock in the game when i get home i can eat you know i can finish eating at 3 or 4 o'clock now and you know it seems to affect my sleep better you know i'm not waking up as much whereas sometimes i wake up 4 times at night because you know if you eat a giant salad a two-pound salad you're waking up four times a night on it - yeah more vegetables more fiber but so long story short right so uh yeah when i so now i'm eating most of my stuff during the day i have more time to use the bathroom during the day i'm not waking up as much during the night i can get better quality sleep i don't feel groggy and feel completely terrible in the morning so i'd argue time of day definitely has a big impact on at least at least you know psyche a lot my psychological health then again if if i feel terrible because i've eaten my calories too late the bedtime that's gonna affect my workouts the next day if i do them at all on that day so um yeah it's all connected reminds me of that paper i read not long ago about they did a mouse study and then they took it to humans their hypothesis was because mice which are of course related to us and a predominantly nocturnal feeders they wondered whether time restriction for humans would work so they actually had people eat in a breakfast before dawn i can't even imagine that time in my mind they had them eating breakfast before sunrise and then they were not allowed to eat i think it was 14 hours until sun until sundown and then they had another meal and it improved quite a number of health biomarkers so there you go it seems to suggest that we are really big mice so that's basically the ramadan diet like eat before you know the sun comes up and you're eating after the sun my diet isn't too far from that to be totally honest but usually during the week you know before probably by 8:30 i've got most of my calories in and then i'll have a small amount you know basically when the sun is getting ready to go down where i fast completely during the day now so but that's a little different now now kind of graze until you eat every couple of hours until you know two o'clock or so but then i try to shut down my calorie intake after about four ish but that it may be different for everyone i mean you could make a point you know you can make a point evolutionarily then the sun went down unless you can make fire you aren't eating you can't forage for food when it's pitch-black and you are the prey instead of being the predator if you're actually foraging in it's pitch black so you could make the argument that when the sun goes down shut it down no eating not even even to wake up in the middle of the night i don't think evolutionarily we were waking up to pee in the middle of the night because your again your potential prey so i mean a neolithic ancestors you know mess oh look at that list mesolithic ancestors they would have been at the whim and mercy of nature and you know as you say being outside not a good idea when you've got like saber-tooth tigers and and all sorts of other night predators that are out to get you so yeah i don't know but yeah and you are right it was it was it is the ramadan and they actually had a it was done in the uk their study and they had accessed i think it was in london i made access to quite a large amount of people who were observing ramadan and it was very interesting and i think things like inflammation biomarkers were reduced and insulin sensitivity was addressed somewhat so yeah people used to tell me my it's funny my mom used to tell me off and other people when i was younger about midnight feasting midnight snacking you know going sneaking down to the fridge and helping yourself to some food you know after midnight i wish i had the day to show her then well actually science proves you wrong mum and you know so carry on snacking alright well it depends on what time that was if it was truly at midnight and maybe not but if it was you know 5:00 in the morning maybe right and then depending on the age - right i mean i bet when you're young when you're you know chronologically young you could probably get away with eating any time whenever you want right but then as you ate or as you age which may probably contribute to an accelerating age right probably take it away with doing that stuff yeah true i mean definitely when i was younger i can i can distinctly remember you know you you you could go out dance and mess about it go clubbing or now dancing and you'd eat you you'd eat your body way in kebabs and drink you know drink so many i didn't even want to think about how many pints of lager we drunk when the amount of calories in an average night i mean good grief you know at sugar we must have consumed but it didn't really affect you when you were younger because your body was just yeah whatever you know it's easy and it's able to tidy itself up and and maintain itself so much better but yeah it's i often say oh i'm not going out there clubs now drinking is a young man's game it it really is yeah i you know if i have a few drinks nowadays there's no way i'm bouncing about like it houston its yeah so yeah there's definitely definitely age is a factor yeah you need rejuvenation mike otherwise we can't go and hit the clubs yeah that's a good point it's a good point that's the main reason this why we're after rejuvenation technology i've been thinking about it all wrong i have to pick him to better roll along yeah that's it well tear it up were used to you know the truth yeah [music] but there you go that's enough about that's enough about my my taste in music you know it was good the 80s was good but but that's another topic for another time yeah sure and but there we go i don't know is the range question so for joel be there is data for soul impressed lymphocyte percentage isn't generally studied as a marker of all cause mortality so what i there is there was data i think from three hundred thousand subjects that uh showed lymphocyte lymphocyte percentage and how it changes their any aging so because to get more insight for the all cause mortality data i use the total number of lymphocytes so you can i should i guess i should have said this you can basically take if around two thousand cells per microliter is optimal i would use that to figure out what lymphocyte percentage corresponds to that so but i'd argue that you know somewhere in the 2000 to 3000 range may be optimal for neutrophils so 3,000 plus 2,000 plus a few hundred for monocytes you know center fields and a thousand fills so i'd maybe argue that probably closer to forty percent of the sites lymphocyte percentage may be optimal but they're just as in data you know in terms of all cause mortality slides available for download that's up to steve and lise well i mean i mean it's no problem no problem with this is it i mean they're your slides mike so yeah put them up there if you want if you want us to put them out there we can we can probably yeah we can yeah when we will actually be posting the video on to the website once it's uploaded to youtube you know probably in the next few days so look out for that early in the week what i'll do is i'll attach the files and we can we can embed them in the article as well if p you know people want to have a look so yeah i don't see any reason why not if you're okay with that much yes sounds good as long as i get a copy the video cuz even what we're doing now this is like podcast style we could chop it up in eclipse and you know release it as you know joe rogan and lots of you know youtubers are you know posting the whole the whole video and then chopping it up into you know shorter clips i think that's a good approach so yeah yeah it takes all sorts so looks like it looks like we're ram the the torrent and it has been attentive questions quite quite a lot of them actually today so you did say you were gonna be popular mic so it does look like that the the torrent is now gone to a trickle at finally but i'm glad i'm glad that people have asked so many questions and we've had you know good steady figures all the way through the stream so and of course many more people watch this later on our youtube the website linkedin or facebook so you know it'll definitely do the rounds i'd be interested to see how many people we reach in the end but it's great that we have so many questions so thanks for everybody at home watching who's asked questions it's fascinating and and mike is a wealth of information on all things microbial and dietary in biomarker biomarker ii that's not really a word but i'm gonna use it because you know what i mean so thanks for thanks for everyone joining us and yeah and thanks for everybody who came in you know on the call as well so listen benny here's got any more questions i guess we can we can wrap it up and big thanks to mike for doing the doing the journal club with this thanks you know you didn't write didn't they yeah we'll have him back folks i reckon he's done all right today but yeah so this time yeah i mean you've been on the journal club before with us haven't you but this time you were in the captain's chair so you've done great and i think everybody at homes enjoyed it seeing a lot of a lot of likes and a lot of questions that usually means that it's popular so yeah we alert we'll do it again and yeah so thanks everybody who got involved today thanks to mike as well for doing this and if you want the slides and such like they will be up soon on the website and of course we are here thanks to the support of the lifespan heroes who are a monthly patrons so thanks to you guys we really do appreciate it and it allows us to do shows like this we're also doing a panel on may the 7th you can find the details on the facebook events in on this on the page where we're streaming to and we we're gonna have fully felipe sierra from the nra tina woods we've got daria katarina we've got aubree degre and david sinclair good grief what a what a what a great discussion that's going to be so that's may 7th so if you if you're about and you you fancy some entertainment they're going to be talking about co vid and what opportunities if any it brings for the research world in the context of aging could there be some good that comes of it honest i think there will possibly be an upside to this and it's not all negative so but we'll find out what the experts think on may the 7th so do tune in for that as well and as i say thanks to the heroes and if you're interested in becoming a hero and supporting this and ionis to do more check it out at wwe fan dot io forward slash hero and with that said we will there we'll see you next time see you guys later that's nice t bye yeah stay healthy guys you
