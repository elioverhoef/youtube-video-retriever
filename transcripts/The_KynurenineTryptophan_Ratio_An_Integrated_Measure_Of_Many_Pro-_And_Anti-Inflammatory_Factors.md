## Transcript

The curin to tryptophan ratio provides information about inflammation but also antioxidant defense and that's what we'll see here so starting with the amino acid tryptophan that's degraded into curine by the enzyme tdo and this is a process that generally happens in the liver for example after we eat a meal tryptophan is degraded into curine and then curine is further degraded with the goal of making nad through the day noo ned synthesis pathway but under inflammatory conditions for example there are many in pro-inflammatory sakin that can induce idio to also degrade tryptophan into curine and some of those include three different interferons interferon gamma alpha and beta the bacterial outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide and tnf alpha conversely there are also anti-inflammatory proteins that can inhibit ido1 including il10 il4 and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase sod so in short the kind yearning to trip thean ratio provides information about many pro- and anti-inflammatory factors so it's an integration of many factors thereby thereby highlighting its importance so with that in mind what's optimal for the ktr or the kine to tryptophan ratio so the this ratio the curine toopan ratio increases during aging so starting with the baseline visit the study included people that had an average age of 59 years and then they provided blood at 11 years later at the follow-up visit so when they had an average age of 70 and there we can see that there was a significant increase for the ktr going from 59 to 70 years old so the significance of the age related increase for the kinding to trip the fan ratio is that a relatively higher ktr is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here so on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio or risk of death for all causes plotted against the ktr on the x and then to to assess significance we put up a line at the uh hazard ratio of one so remember when the shaded gray region is either completely above one or completely below one we have a significant association so in terms of lowest risk we can see that that's true when the ktr is 15 to 23 as you can see that the shaded gray region is completely below one conversely when the ktr is above 25 that's associated with an increased all cause mortality risk all right so with that in mind what's my data as i've now measured the con and tryptophan four times and i've done that by sending blood for atome metabolomics using io's kit and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me make many videos using this kit and i won't go through each of them here i'll put some of them in the right corner if you missed any of them now this kit provides information not just on these metabolites but also 600 plus and if you're interested in measuring them and others there'll be a discount link in the video's description all right so what's my data i mentioned i have four tests and we can see that here from april to september of 2023 and my average over those four tests so far is 24 nanomoles per micromolar now to put that into perspective what from the data that i just showed lowest all cause mortality risk was when the ktr was 15 to 23 so i'm just outside of that right now with an average of 24 but the good news is is that all cause mortality risk increases when the ktr is greater than 25 so it's not great news it's not terrible news i'm somewhere in the middle for now but there is room for hope as for the last test my ktr was 21 and with that in mind the next test is scheduled for the end of this month so once i get to five tests or results for five tests i'll start to look at correlations with diet and supplements and i can start to get an idea of what may be impacting it with the goal of keeping it close to 21 or lower if i can for as long as possible all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic and tmr testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing including apob green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand including one of the shirts that i've got on now that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
