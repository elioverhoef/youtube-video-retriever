# DHEA-S Is A Weakness In My Data: Blood Test #5 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video i ended by asking the question are there weaknesses in my blood test data and i highlighted a total cholesterol of 133 as a potential problem so in today's video let's start off by investigating what's optimal for total cholesterol and we can see that here so starting with the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against blood levels of cholesterol on the x and this data is in 45 to 50 year olds 54 year olds or more specifically 44 to 55 year olds which is what was included in the supplementary data for the paper and if you're interested in looking at this paper this and all the papers in this video will be in the video's description so note that this is more than 3.3 million subjects in this age range and my chronological age is within this uh age range of 44 to 55 so it may be most relevant to me so starting with the referent which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol and when putting my data into perspective we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with a more than two-fold increased all-cause mortality risk and superficially this is bad news so let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective and note that low total cholesterol is found in youth but also in older ages which is what we can see here so this is the larger study based on the study on the left and this includes total cholesterol on the y axis plotted against age of entry on the x so this age range age range goes from 18 to 88 years so what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth somewhere in the 160 to 170 range depending on if you're a man or a woman and then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women and after which we can see then a an age-related decline such that if we extrapolate further to uh about 100 years old or older and i covered this in an earlier video and if you missed that it'll be in the right corner we can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age including centenarians so how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all-cause mortality risk so low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all-cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got relative risk for all-cause mortality and this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160 and with varying levels of albumin alb and hdl cholesterol hdlc and note that this data is in a very small study it only included 393 people so this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol will need more studies uh in this area but note this study was published in 2001 and i haven't come across any other studies including the study on the left that adjusted their data for things like albumin for example so this is in 79 year olds and uh let's get into the data so when compared with the hazard ratio of one when the brackets or 95 confidence interval is completely below one as indicated by the green arrows there we have a significant effect statistically significant effect in contrast when the 95 confidence interval overlaps with one as shown there that effect is not statistically significant so let's start off by defining the aged phenotype and in this case the referent actually ended up being having higher all-cause mortality risk and so in that case this was was uh people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 real and relatively low albumin and hdl so less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for hdl and the reason that's the age phenotype is because i showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced stage so we've got total cholesterol less than 160 and then albumin and hdl decline during aging so we see relatively lower albumin and hdl in people with advanced stage so combined low total cholesterol low albumin low hdl that's the aged phenotype so what happens if we have relatively higher hdl within that context and then as i mentioned we can see that the 95 confidence interval overlaps with one so this is not significantly different from the referent so we can conclude that higher hdl relatively higher hdl doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin what about when albumin is relatively high as shown there and now we have a significant effect and i've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth and we can see that 32 decreased all-cause mortality risk as indicated by the green arrow in that group but the best data of this of this bunch was for people that had the youthful phenotype of low total cholesterol and relatively high albumin and hdl and note that again those three would be expected to be found in people who are younger by large or not chronologically younger or compared with people of advanced age so for that group we can see that we had a 62 decreased all-cause mortality risk so you can see the hazard ratio in the middle 0.38 so to get the 62 percent you do one minus 0.38 and you get 0.62 which would be 62 a 62 reduction for all-cause mortality risk for people who had relatively low total cholesterol but high relatively high albumin and hdl cholesterol were compared with people who had low total cholesterol but the aged phenotype with low albumin and low hdl and that's we can see there look relatively low total cholesterol but relatively high albumin and hdl those people have a reduced all-cause mortality risk so before putting my data into perspective there's another question that must be asked which is how does this combination compare with higher total cholesterol for all-cause mortality risk and they compared that in this same study so we've got all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against years of follow-up and in this case they re-examined the 79-year-olds up to six years later so now we have three cholesterol groups but in this case it's total cholesterol less than 160 but with the relatively youthful phenotype of higher albumin and higher hd higher hdl and we're comparing these three groups including the two higher cholesterol groups of 161 to 239 and greater than 240 now there's no significant difference for all-cause mortality risk so from this we can conclude that low total cholesterol but relatively high albumin and hdl which again would be expected to be found in a youthful age or at a youthful chronological age there was no all-cause mortality risk difference versus people who had higher total cholesterol so to put my data into perspective for blood test number five in 2022 my abby moon was 48 and hd hdl was 44 which is the close to the youthful phenotype if my hdl was just a bit higher at 47 my data would be in the youthful phenotype so based on this accordingly i'm not worried about total cholesterol of 133 but a relatively low dhea sulfate is a weakness in my data and we can see that data here i measured dhea sulfate on this same blood test where i calculated my biological age and we can see that oh well first we can see that my dhea sulfate is 129 micrograms per deciliter and just as a quick intro dhea sulfate is the most abundant circulating steroid in people now a big part of my approach is going after the biggest fish for example albumin is the most abundant circulating protein red blood cells are one of the most abundant circulating cell types so i think it makes the most sense to optimize the things that are the most abundant in blood first while focusing on the things that are lesser abundant second now if i only focused on the reference range as shown on the right of 61 to 442 micrograms per deciliter i would miss this as a potential weakness in my data so why do i think this is even a weakness in my data first dhea sulfate levels decline during aging and this is in a study of about 4 700 people if anybody's come across larger studies i it looked thoroughly for larger studies and i try try to always show data for the largest studies as they may represent the population averages more accurately relative to smaller studies so for dhea sulfate we can see that it peaks around 20 and then afterwards it declines very steadily during aging so putting my data into perspective of 100 429 micrograms per deciliter which equals 3.5 micromoles per liter we can see that i'm relatively low for my chronological age and note that i'd be low even for younger ages so that would be young for a 30 year old and even worse this is what i'd expect to see someone who had an older chronological age this may be common for people in their 60s 70s and 80s based on the aging-relating uh aging related plot so this is only one data point though and as many of you may know i have up to 39 blood tests since 2015. So is this an anomaly i mean do is this representative of my actual dhea sulfate level so do i have earlier data for dhea sulfate and i do but it's only from 2005. This isn't a commonly performed blood test uh so for whatever reason in 2005 i measured it twice over a two year span and my average over those two tests was 300 micrograms per deciliter and if we put that data on the age-related plot we can see that it's there and there's definitely been a decline for my dhea sulfate levels during aging now no going further with dhea sulfate having a level at my current level is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and we can see that here so we've got the cumulative survival rate on the y-axis plotted against follow-up and in this case it was a relatively small study but a very long study you can see that there was a 27-year follow-up which is very long for uh when compared with other studies and the average age of these subjects was 51 which is pretty close to my chronological age so it may be directly relevant so what we can see is that the group that had the lowest dhea sulfate levels in this case 129 or less had the worst survival rate when compared with people who had higher levels of dhea sulfate uh in this case more than 200 micrograms per deciliter so my dhea sulfate seems to be a weakness in my data now as i mentioned is this one test uh representative of my actual dhea sulfate level so i blood test up to eight times per year will this be representative of my year to year change for dhea sulfate so i've in earlier videos i've mentioned that at home blood testing may be the future of health optimization and one reason for that is because you can collect a large amount of data in a short period of time so with that in mind i've used another at-home blood testing company to accumulate 12 blood tests using finger prick in contrast with the venipuncture which is how i obtained uh this dhea sulfate level of 129 so i have 12 blood tests by finger prick within the last two months now no even with my rigorous test testing schedule of up up to eight six to eight times per year it would take me you know a year and a half at most just by venipuncture to accumulate 12 blood tests so at home blood testing may be uh you know as i mentioned the future of health optimization so to get those 12 blood tests i used a company called quantify and as you can see uh you know just with a screenshot from their from their website their mission is to radically increase human lifespan so anybody that's familiar with this channel my motto is conquer aging or die trying so i'm happy to use this product and to continue to use it in the future and if you're interested in using it yourself i'll have a discount link in the video's description so what's my data for dhea sulfate using uh fingerprint so we can see that here and we can see that this is actually over a seven week period july 9th through august 27th and again 12 blood tests using the test quantify from quantify and we can see over those 12 tests that my average dhea sulfate level is 119.8 micrograms per deciliter so that's pretty close and in the ballpark of 129. So from this we can conclude that dhea sulfate by fingerprick may be as good as venipuncture for at least dhea sulfate so then the big question is how will i increase dhea sulfate and if you remember i started this video with cholesterol so what does cholesterol have to do with dhea sulfate so dhea sulfate is produced via cholesterol degradation and we can see that here so first starting with cholesterol and this would be a process that happens in the adrenal glands which are located on top of the kidneys and they happen at three different portions of the adrenal gland as indicated by that black black rectangle so with cholesterol after that's degraded into pregnenolone pregnenolone is hydroxylated into 17 hydroxy pregnenolone which is then converted into dhea and then dhea is sulfated into dhea sulfated so the formation of dhea sulfate is just four enzymatic steps uh af via the degradation of cholesterol so now note that if relatively low dhea sulfate is because of low low total cholesterol i would expect that cortisol and testosterone would also be low and that's because 17 hydroxypregnenolone is converted via two enzymatic steps into cortisol and dhea is converted also by two enzymatic steps into testosterone so what's my data first starting off with cortisol to see if that's true and uh this blood test quantify that the company quantify also includes cortisol and testosterone they also have a female panel specific for some female hormones so if you're interested in that check it out so my for 12 blood tests using quantify my cortisol level is 12.5 micrograms per deciliter so let's put that data into perspective by looking at the age-related changes for cortisol and this again is from that study of about 47 more than 4 700 to 4 800 people so cortisol is a little bit different from dhea sulfate we can see a small increase for cortisol during aging and putting my data into perspective it doesn't look like it's low it's somewhere in the midpoint of what you'd expect for someone of my chronological age what about earlier data do i have earlier data though for cortisol and for whatever reason back in 2005 i measured it twice and over those two tests my average was 18.5 18.35 micrograms per deciliter and when putting that data on to this plot we can see that there too i've had a reduction for cortisol levels uh over the past 17 years now whether three data points is actually representative of the true story i'm going to have to measure this a lot more going forward in the future so stay tuned for that so we've got relatively low within my own data dhea sulfate and cortisol over the past 17 years despite being on only a few few blood tests what about testosterone so what's my data so over those 12 blood tests so at home blood testing using the company quantify my testosterone level is 5.6 nanograms per deciliter so let's put that into the aging plot as shown there and the story for testosterone is similar to dhea sulfate it peaks around 20 and then declines during aging and putting my data into perspective although it's not low based on the overall population you can see i'm somewhere towards the higher end of the age range for a 50 year old i do have earlier data but only one test in 2005 and we can see that i've also experienced the decline for testosterone now what were my levels of cortisol and testosterone optimal in 2005 i i don't know but again i'm going to continue to measure these biomarkers and see how the story plays out with the specific focus on optimizing dhea sulfate so just as a brief summary we can see that i've had within my own data age-related declines for these three biomarkers for dhea sulfate cortisol and testosterone so when considering that these hormones are produced by our cholesterol in my opinion the first step would be to increase blood levels of cholesterol so how can i do that what's the best way to do that and for those who don't know i've tracked my diet every day with a food scale since 2015 so i have dietary data that corresponds to each blood test up to 39 blood tests so i can see within my own data what the best ma best way may be to optimize blood levels of cholesterol and for me that may be by increasing dietary cholesterol now i know that i've heard people saying that dietary cholesterol doesn't it doesn't raise blood cholesterol but we can see very clearly in my data that a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.7 and a significant p-value that dietary cholesterol in my case may raise my total blood cholesterol now just for reference for blood test number five in 2022 we we can see that my diet average daily dietary cholesterol intake was 24 milligrams per day and that uh is in conjunction with a blood cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter so we're considering this correlation for dietary cholesterol for with blood cholesterol it would seem that with the goal of increasing dhea sulfate i can easily maximize dietary cholesterol intake which may optimize blood level or increase blood levels of cholesterol but will i increase will i improve one biomarker dhe sulfate and make others worse so let's let's check that out so here we're going to see correlations for dietary cholesterol intake with big picture biomarkers and for those who may not have seen this analysis on my channel just run through it real quick these big picture biomarkers represent uh many biomarkers of organ and systemic health including glucose which should be in any anti-aging approach a marker of methylation including homocysteine three markers of kidney function three markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins hdl ldl vldl and lipoprotein a immune related cells and the proteins including globulins red blood cell related measures a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein and overall biological age scores indicated by levine's phenoage and aging.ai so we've also got some other information on this table in this table the little end next to each blood test is how many blood tests that i have data for it so for example for glucose i have 37 blood tests since 2015 the r at the top left is the correlation coefficient and the p value at the right on the right is the measure of statistical significance with less than 0.05 being statistically significant so what's significantly correlated for or how does dietary cholesterol significantly correlate with these big picture biomarkers so a higher dietary cholesterol intake in my data is significantly correlated with higher blood urea nitrogen bun higher alkaline phosphatase higher ldl higher levels of neutrophils a lower lymphocyte percentage higher levels of monocytes higher uh platelets higher levels of red blood cells and that's it so we've got eight significant correlations within my own data for dietary cholesterol with other big picture biomarkers and note that once i've got enough data for dhea sulfate i'm going to include that on this list as a big picture biomarker so we'll expand the list by at least one so then the next step is to address are these significant correlations going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk now i've covered biomarker direction directionality in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk in other videos but just as a quick review for example blood urine nitrogen alkaline phosphatase neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging so that we have positive correlations with dietary cholesterol suggests that these are going in the wrong direction so i've given them red arrows if anyone's got questions on the other biomarkers and why i've given them red arrows going in the wrong direction just leave a comment and i'll be happy to address that so now that we've got a net score of -8 so eight red arrows eight correlations going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk what do we do with that information so if the net score was positive i would eat above my average intake for total cholesterol for dietary cholesterol if the net score was zero i would eat my average intake since 2015 for cholesterol and in this case because the net score is negative that suggests that i should eat below my average intake for dietary cholesterol now since 2015 my average dietary cholesterol intake is 126.4 milligrams per day now just for reference we can see that for this most recent test a couple weeks ago it was 24 milligrams per day so to stay within my own rules to eat below my average i can go from 24 up to 126 for dietary cholesterol in order to follow the correlations and i think that following the correlations as much as possible leads to the best overall biomarker data so my current cholesterol intake with the aim of increasing it but staying below my average intake since 2015 is now 91.5 milligrams per day of dietary cholesterol i've done that by adding a couple of a couple of eggs per week while still sticking to the macros and micros that have uh resulted in this biological age profile that is somewhere in the 15 to 20 year younger range when using levine's and aging.ai tests so then the big question is can going from 24 to somewhere around 90 milligrams per day for dietary cholesterol will that increase dhea sulfate but not mess up the other biomarkers so stay tuned for that in future videos we'll we'll address that data all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before
