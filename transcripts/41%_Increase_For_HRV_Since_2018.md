# 41% Increase For HRV Since 2018

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

With the goal of longevity a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible resting heart rate and heart rate variability provide information about the heart but also the nervous system and the adrenal gland and that's what we can see here so resting heart rate and heart rate variability are obviously measures localized to the heart but their levels are impacted by the balance between sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves including the vagus nerve in addition sympathetic nerve activation of the adrenal gland impct resting heart rate and heart rate variability through nor epinephrine and epinephrine so when considering that this is an integrated measure resting heart rate and heart rate variability are an integrated measure of at least three organ systems what's optimal and to address that in this video we'll take a look at how these metrics change during aging and as i mentioned a ma a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible so i've been tracking it both of these metrics since 2018 so what's my data as i now have more than 2100 days of data so let's start off by taking a look at how resting heart rate changes during aging and that's what we can see here these data are generated by whoop and that's what i've worn since 2018 i'm not here to promote them not here to say who's the best but that's what i've worned so it's most relevant to show their uh data for age related changes on the y- axis we've got the average resting heart rate plotted against age from 20 to 50 years and then for both women in red and men in blue we can see that resting heart rate increas increases during aging but what about for people older than 50 years a clue for that comes for from the data for women at 45 to 50 years we can see that there's a small decline so for ages older than 50 we've got to go to fitbit data as as far as i know there's no whoop data that's been published at older ages so older than 50 as far as i know only fitbit data has been published like that and that's what we can see here so same setup average resting heart rate on the y- ais plotted against age and we can see now that the age ranges from 20 to 85 years in agreement with the whoop data though we can see that resting heart rate does indeed increase up to around 50 followed by a decline from 50 to about 85 years now note that relatively low resling heart rates are found in both young and older ages so is a low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging and this is where measuring heart rate variability is important if you're only measuring your wrestling heart rate and you don't know your heart rate variability it's possible to have ag data and not youthful data so hrv provides more context in terms of identifying whether a low resting heart rate is youthful or aged so to see why that's true how does heart rate variability change during aging and that's what we'll see here so this two is fitbit data this is in a study of 8.2 million people on the y- axis we've got the hrv metric which is the rmssd this is the root mean squared of successive differences whoop uses this measure for hrv and so does fitbit and on the x-axis we've got age from 20 to 60 years and then note that there are two traces solid and dashed the solid lines are hrv measured at 6:00 in the morning and the dashed is at 6:00 at night regardless of which of those lines are used we can see that hrv declines during aging so now we can address the question is a low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging by bringing back our plot at relatively younger ages especially in 20-year-olds we'd be more likely to see or it's more likely uh to to expect a low resting heart rate in conjunction with a relatively high heart rate variability so values of somewhere around 75 uh for hrv and 62 at least based on the fitbit data could be an average value and then for someone close to my chronological age of 50 years a relatively higher resting heart rate and a lower heart rate variability would be expected all right so then what about older than 60 years so i'm not going to show it in this video i've presented this data in other videos but hrv continues to decline at least from 60 to 80 years and with that in mind at older ages in 80 to 85 year olds a low resting heart rate in conjunct conjunction with a low heart rate variability could be the or would be expected to be the average value all right so now that we've defined this hrv wrestling heart rate com combination what's my data how well am i resisting age related changes and again the goal is longevity on the channel i want to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible so first let's start off with the average yearly resting heart rate this is when i started tracking in august of 2018 through the end of june 2024 so q2 2024 uh so this is basically this first 6 months of 2024 update and that's we'll see here so each dot is a single days worth of data now when i first started tracking average yearly resting heart rate in 2018 was about 51 beats per minute which is close to age expected at that time and note that i've never been sedentary at any point in fact i was doing more uh actually longer weight training workouts uh you know low intensity cardio every day i was far more active then than i am now and this goes to the idea of exercise prescription what's the dose frequency and intensity of exercise where we can optimize hrv and resting heart rate but also optimize physical function now maybe that doesn't lead to the maximum physical function but my goal is to optimize physical cognitive and you know metabolic health and all the biomarkers and hrv and resling heart rate are a part of that equation so then in 2019 average da resling heart rate i was able to reduce it and then sequentially reduce it every year thereafter all right what about in 2024 so after the first 6 months average wrestling heart rate is currently or was through june 30th 42 beats per minute so starting from 2018 we can see that i been able to reduce consistent l reduce resting heart rate from 51 to 42 beats per minute now rather than just looking at year-to-year averages we can compare these data or parts of it statistically using a two sample t test so when i compare the data year-over-year first 6 months of 2023 for first 6 months of 2024 they are significantly different meaning that the 42 beats per minute average thus far in 2024 first 6 months is significantly lower than the first 6 months of 2023 where the average was 43.7 beats per minute and we can see that the p value is far below 0.05 as it's 2 * 10 -21 additionally we can compare 2024's 6 months of data versus where i started in 2018 and that too is significantly lower with a p value of 1 * 10 the 1 1221 power so um highly statistically significant the the reduction in resting heart rate since 2018 but remember is a low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging now the good news is that i've avoided the age related increase or at least the age expected increase based on published data as you can see from 45 to around 50 years uh an increase for wrting heart rate would be expected followed by that age related decline so am i just experiencing the age related wrestling heart rate decline and this is where looking at hrv is important so that provides more context so same setup over that same time period now we're going to take a look at average yearly heart rate variabil ility which is what we'll see here so when i first started tracking average yearly hrv was 47.3 and again this is age expected data in 2018 i was you know far more active again as i mentioned earlier than i am now but yet had worse data i increased hrv in 2019 and 2020 had a regression in 2021 as we'll see in an upcoming video that's likely linked to weight gain and then i got leaner in 2022 and 2023 hrv correspondingly increased and then in 2024 after the first 6 months it's a small amount higher at six average so far in 2024 is 66.6 milliseconds so we can see that since 2018 i've increased average hrv from 47 to 67 mill milliseconds per day so this idea that hrv is an individualized metric and it can't be improved much it just simply isn't true it just takes discovering the recipe exercise uh you know intensity dose frequency and duration uh in addition to other factors which i'll cover in an upcoming video now when using the statistics using a two sample t test to compare year-over-year change first 6 months 2023 versus first 6 months of 2024 we can see that 2024 is off to a good start there's a 2.7 millisecond uh improvement you can see the p value is 8 * 105 so i've improved year-over-year by a small but statistically significant amount for hrv and compared with where i started in 2018 that 2 is a significant improvement with a p value of 3 * 10 -70 so now we can answer the question is a low resting heart rate in my case indicative of youth or aging so a relatively high heart rate variability plus a low resting heart rate my average values thus far in 2024 of 67 for hrv and 42 for resting heart rate is relatively youthful for example based on chronological age 35 for hrv would be expected and 56 for resting heart rate so i've got better data relative to my chronological age for both hrv and resting heart rate note that i think i can do better it may take me some time to discover the recipe but uh note that values in youth of hrv of 100 versus 42 or 40ish uh and you know shout out seenland i see his data and it's like 100 over 40 so uh you know that's the target in terms of uh you know what a youthful hrv a youthful and fit hrv and heart rate looks like so i've got room i've got work to do to get to that level i i'm confident i can get closer to that over time it's going to take me some time now all right so what's contributing to improvement since 2018 and as i mentioned body weight is is a part of that equation but also the exercise prescription and i'll have more on that in an upcoming video i'm aiming for next week so if you're interested in seeing what's under the hood in terms of what may be contributing check it out all right that's all for now if you're interested in more my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links including epigenetic testing ned quantification oral microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with cfox
