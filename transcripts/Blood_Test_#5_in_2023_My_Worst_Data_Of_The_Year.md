# Blood Test #5 in 2023: My Worst Data Of The Year

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed apologies if you've heard that a million times but that's the central premise of the channel so with that in mind earlier this week i blood tested for the fifth time in 2023 so what's my biological age and that's what we can see here and this is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you want to measure your own biological age using the the lavine test there'll be a link in the video's description all right so when entering the data for the nine biomarkers and chronological age i get a biological age of 38.9 years which is 11.7 years younger than my chronological now 11.7 years superficially may seem great but this is 5 years worse than my recent trend of 16 years younger for many tests so we'll take a deeper look why that could be uh just in a minute now note that for the 12th consecutive test and this is good news quest high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was less than3 mig per liter so at most crp could be3 but also it could be lower it can't be higher than3 that's their limit of detection so some good news within the context of a 5-year older biological age and if you're interested in all of the blood test data screenshots of that will be later in the video now this is just one test for more context let's h let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 as i have 27 blood tests uh over that period and that's what we can see here so from 2018 to 2019 i only have three data points with an average biological age using the the lavine test of 36.1 years and then over 12 tests from 2020 to 2021 average age was 35.6 seven tests in 2022 i significantly reduced it to 33 3.8 years and if you missed any of these videos um some will be in the right corner but i have playlists for 2022 and 2021 data so if you're interested in that check it out and then thus far in 2023 the average biological age using the lavine test is 34.7 even when including this 38.9 but what i'd like to highlight is take a look at how far away it is from the rest of the data it's an outlier or it looks like an outlier in fact i haven't had data this bad going back only to 2020 i've only had two data points uh that have been as bad or one data point that's been as bad as this most recent test which raises the question is this an outlier or an early indication of a chronic problem and there's no way to know for now all that i can continue to do is test to get on top of it if it is a chronic problem but it's possible also that this is just an outlier and the other test will go back to my 16-year or or better uh average all right so what got significantly worse i could focus on creatinine and glucose which went in the wrong direction but what i'd like to focus on is the percentage of lymphocytes other in other words how many lymphocytes uh lymphocytes divided by total white blood cells that's the lymphocyte percentage so the lymphocytes during aging and that's what we can see here with the percentage on the y- axis plotted against chronological age from the 20 to 90e range on the x and first starting with the data from m we can see a clear uh decline for the there's a biphasic response likely mediated by childbirth and or menopause we can see that uh young women have values around 27% that declined to about 22% in advanced age all right so what's my data i have 46 blood tests that go back to 2003 for the percentage of lymphocytes and that's what we can see here so from 2003 to 2008 i wasn't testing very often but i do have three data points with an average lymy percentage of about 41% and and then i started testing more often in starting in 2015 and we can see that over 43 tests from 2015 to 2023 not about 9 years that's about five tests per year average lymphocyte test there's no difference for these two groups of data although three data points may not be enough for a real comparison nonetheless we don't see an age related decline for the lymy percentage in my data but note that most recent data point of 25.7 far away from all of the other data so that again raises the question is it an outlier or a potential indicator of a chronic problem or potential chronic problem in addition why did it happen so what was mostly different for this test and we'll take a deeper dive into this in the next video uh in terms of diet changes test over test but uh in terms of supplements that's also a possibility for example i increased my tryptophan intake to 2 gam per day which is basically 300% higher than my baseline intake my baseline intake is 1 gr per day with 2 gam of tryptophan now we're up to 3 g per day uh so did that mess up my immune system biomarkers maybe maybe it messed up my gut maybe it messed up my immune system i don't know for sure but i've taken it out of the approach for now even without knowing what it did if anything to my ned levels as i wait for those results to come in now the biological age using theine test i don't only track it using that metric i also use aging.ai so when entering its 19 component biomarkers as shown there and this is using the north american data set so if anyone wants to double check the numbers i get a predicted age of 33 years which is 17.6 years younger than my chronological so not bad but i've got it in red because it's not as as good as my best data for aging.ai over the past few years so that too raises the question what got worse test over test so i could focus on glucose blood your nitrogen or bun and creatinine which went in the wrong direction in terms terms of age related changes but probably the most dramatic change are platelets which went below 200 so let's take a deeper look at that platelets decline during aging and that's what we can see here and this is data for men i've covered dat data for women in uh in an earlier video so if you missed that if you just do a search for platelets on the channel you should be able to find it so here we can see that within the 20 to 100 year age range we can see that platelets decline from about 231 to 209 and the importance of that age related decline as platelets move towards 200 or even potentially below is that less than 200 but also greater than 300 for platelets is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so when 200 to 300 was the reference we can see that having platelets higher than 300 300 to less than 400 but also greater than 400 was associated with a significantly increased all cause mortality risk we can see that data in parenthesis is completely above one so it's a significant association similar sly when platelets are less than 200 we can see an 8% increased risk and then if they're less than 100 it's an even higher risk 93% increased risk for all cause mortality so having platelets at 179 is definitely in the wrong direction it's aged and it will put me at a higher risk for all cause mortality if that was the case going forward for every test so with that in mind what's my data and that's we can see here for platelets this is 49 blood tests that go back to 2008 unfortunately i don't have data for platelets before 2008 in contrast with the lymph asy percentage data where i have data that goes back to 2003 so from 2008 to 2013 average platelets were 210 and that's over six tests and then after testing more often starting in 2015 over 43 tests we can see that average platelets were 229 so basically reversing uh that age related uh change so going from 210 going higher to 229 and that's what we can see there so and that's that these differences between groups using a two sample t test is significantly different as indicated by that p value of 0.04 now for the most recent data point we can see that that's there i have had a few data points for platlets that have been that low in the past but very rarely as you can see and in terms of that age related decline maybe that's not exactly true because if we look back to a few tests we can see that there is a bit of a trend going towards lower platelets so the goal for the next test is to identify correlations with platelets and my data with diet starting with that and i'll see what i can potentially do to get it above 200 that's the goal now just like we did for lavine's test this is only one test for aging.ai for more context let's have a look at previous data which is what we can see here as i have 42 blood tests that go back to 2009 that can be used to compute aging.ai so from 2008 to 2013 over three tests average aging.ai age was 32 years and then after testing more often from 2016 to 2022 34 tests average age 29.8 years and and thus far in 2023 even with that most recent 33 years my average so far in 2023 2023 this year is 304 30 sorry hard to say 30.4 years so even with this bit of a recent uh higher higher than i' like data 2023 is still not too far from where i've been over the past uh 15 years or so so my aging is still consistently within that 30 to 32e age range at least my average data since 2008 so what was different for this test besides tryptophan in terms of diet and or supplements and i'll cover that in a video coming soon but for now what i'd like to do is take a deeper dive into the blood test report which is shown here so first what i'd like to highlight are red blood cells which are used in the lavine test as a metric for biological age now superficially 5.3 may be okay if we just use the reference range you can see it's within that range of 3.8 to 10.8 but as i've mentioned in earlier videos the reference range is is not what's optimal for health and potentially longevity and i covered this in an earlier video where the white blood cell optimal range is probably 3.5 to 6 and if you miss that video it'll be right there in the right corner but even there going deeper what i'd like to focus on are nutrifil and lymphocytes as the major cell types that are found within white blood cell counts so even though 5.3 is within that optimal range of 3.56 nutrifil and lymphocytes went in the wrong direction for this test and that's because what's optimal for neutr feels are in the 2,000 to 3000 range so we can see my 3578 although within that reference range is not within that quote unquote optimal range in terms of at least reduced all cause mortality risk similarly for lymphocytes somewhere around 2,000 may be optimal and again that data is in the video in the right corner and even though my 1362 is within the reference range again which i think goes up to 3900 here 850 to 3900 it's it's it's going in the wrong direction as they decline during aging so just focusing on that total white blood cell count may be misleading it's i think it's more instructive and informative to look at levels of nutrifil lymphocytes and even monocytes which comprise probably about 95 to 95% or more of the total white blood cell counts all right page two of the blood test report lipid panel crp and glucose and this blood test raises some questions including did high do serene 6 g per day my highest intake yet and vitamin b6 supplementation eightfold higher than my baseline reduce homosysteine so i haven't shown homosysteine data uh in this video and i do have that data so stay tuned for that in a future video also did i make progress for increasing dhea sulfate and did trip the fan 2 grams per day impact nad as i expected it would increase nad through the day novo nad synthesis pathway and i don't yet have those results so stay tuned for that too in a future video and also where epigenetic and t data wors as i sent blood for analysis also on the day of this blood test on august 21st so stay tuned for all these videos coming soon all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic anamir testing or microbiome composition green te at home blood testing with sciox health note that their panel is mostly different from the metabolomics data as it includes apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
