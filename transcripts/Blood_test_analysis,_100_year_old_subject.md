What's up everybody today i'm gonna talk about centenarian blood test values so i'm gonna summarize the findings of this paper here pro-inflammatory status is not a limit for longevity case report of a sicilian centenarian so it published in aging clinical and experimental research and if you want to look up the paper yourself i've included the doi so let's look at the demographics of this subject so she was relatively short 147 centimeters tall four foot nine feet 45 kilograms and weight which translates to 99 pounds resulting in a bmi of relatively lean bmi of twenty point eight kilograms per meter squared interestingly bmi is in that range less than 25 have been reported in other centenarians studies so what's associated with her longevity does she have longevity genes or long telomeres so the authors of the study looked at a couple of genes that have been shown to be strongly associated with longevity in this case fox o3a and the snip associated with that so she had one g allele and one t allele and that is not that combination is not associated with longevity in contrast gg having two copies of the g allele is associated with increased lifespan so she doesn't have longevity leo's related to fox o3a what about a pulley well looking at these two snips for the apoe gene well she had a t allele and a sealeo which translates to the ìiî ìiî april ii genotype and this is not associated with longevity longevity for april we is associated with 1 e 2 & 1 iii allele whereas increased mortality risk is associated with 1 e4 and 1t 3 so at least based on these two genes for that have been reported to be associated with longevity fox o3 and a police she does not have longevity genes so what about long telomeres so the authors of the study reported that her relative telomere length was 0.66 which was below the average value 0.84 four female centenarians that were previously reported in another study so the telomere length is very popular in terms of aging but based on her telomere length it's one could argue that our telomere length has nothing to do with her longevity so what about our blood biomarkers so first let's look at her liver liver biomarkers so her generally all of them pretty good alt ast alanine and aspartate aminotransferase is pretty good decent alkaline phosphatase at 75 alkaline phosphatase alp increases during aging lower values are around 50 or associated reduced risk of death for all causes 75 is not bad it could be better but considering her age it's not bad i mean going further ggt bilirubin conjugated bilirubin all decent values nothing too extreme and then what's interesting is her albumin levels are very good forty six point four grams per liter i've i have video with a beaman data showing that it decreases during aging to values in the threes 36 38 or less in people her age or even younger so her albumin levels are actually fantastic and then her total protein levels at 80 may not seem bad superficially but total proteins equal albumin plus globulin s-- so when you subtract albumin from total proteins you get a glob ian level of 33 point six which is actually pretty high i'm not going to go into all the data here but there's all cause mortality data showing that about 25,000 around 25 are associated with reduced risk of death for all causes for globulin globulin tzar in other words immunoglobulins there are part of the immune system and and how they would respond to infections so she may have some underlying infectious issues going on okay so let's have a look at her lipid profile and it's actually pretty good so total cholesterol 215 superficially may seem high based on the reference range but i'll get more to that in a minute triglycerides at 98 there's a meta-analysis data showing that values less than ninety or associated with paul reduce risk of all-cause mortality so her ninety of al you is not far from that so that's good i should note that values closer to about fifty or associated with biological youths relative to that there's room for improvement hdl is sixty two very good for her age ldl based on the reference range is elevated at 133 but there is a number there are a number of studies for ldl showing that higher levels of ldl are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in adults older than seventy five eighty and beyond so when you consider the 133 hdl is contributing to the total cholesterol of 215 or a lipid profiles actually not bad now what about other hematological parameters other circulating biomarkers well where kidney functions not great in fact borderline poor so her creatinine levels are 1.25 milligrams per deciliter and that translates into an e gfr and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 35 which is very low kidney function in biological youth or in youth actually is around 104 egfr 35 is very low end-stage renal disease is basically an egfr of zero so she's not too far from that kidney functions not great based on her creatinine levels similarly urea circulating levels of urea increased during aging and or a marker of kidney function so poorly functioning kidneys can't filter out the urea to urinate it out and her urea levels translate into a blood urea nitrogen close to 30 now there's more all cause mortality data showing that values less than 15 are associated with lowest risk of death for all causes regardless of what the reference range is so this is about two fold higher than that not good also contributing to the not great news is her circulating levels of glucose glycaemia at 108 she's pre-diabetic now interestingly her uric acid levels which are also a marker of kidney function are good and then her c reactive protein obviously a marker of information is actually pretty good 1.13 even though the reference range less than 5 is optimal i have a video and a blog post showing that values close to zero are associated with reduced risk of death from all causes and lower valleys are found in biological youth so this is potentially the best data of all that she's got low inflammation and then going forward other her red blood cells and differentials her red blood cells at three point nine aren't isn't bad values closer to four and a half or found in biological youth but luckily and fortunately her hemoglobin levels which are found in red blood cells are high so for each red blood cell she's got more hemoglobin content which is good news because you need oxygen you need hemoglobin to carry oxygen oxygen is used to perform work by the cells now the bad news so her mean corpuscular volume in her red cells does she have big red cells or small red blood cells and her mean corpuscular volume is actually very high in 100.8 values around eighty eight are found in biological youth and values higher than about 88 to 90 are associated with an increased risk of death for all causes so the mcv is definitely in the wrong direction similarly her her red blood cell distribution with rdw is high so at seventeen point four and i have a blog post on my website showing that reduce risk of death for all causes found for rdw values closer to twelve point five or less this is too high for leukocytes or total white blood cells is seven point five five although there within the reference range there is ample data showing that values less than six or within the three and a half to six range is better for risk of death or associated with reduced risk of death for all causes and then the distribution for her neutrophils and lymphocytes actually not bad so the neutrophil the lymphocyte ratio here is about 1.8 values closer to one or ideal values less than two are pretty good so her distribution isn't bad in and similar to the crp data her lymphocytes are actually pretty good she's got the lymphocyte levels of a young person so at two point five five or twenty five fifty cells per microliter lymphocytes levels decrease with age and it's it's one of the main problems of coronaviruses coronavirus lymphocyte levels in chrono virus patients are almost completely wiped out to the point where they're 800 or less so she's got great lymphocytes a great immune response alright so just to summarize her data the good news her livers in good shape and she's got high albumin actually i mean levels that are indicative of biologically you she's got a good lipid profile relatively high levels of hdl and ldl which is associated with reduced mortality risk in older adults she's got relatively little information and she's got higher than optimal white blood cells which should be you know somewhere in the 3/2 1/2 to 6 range but high lymphocytes which you know decrease during aging so the bad news her globulin levels are relatively high she's got reduced kidney function as indicated by the creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels she's pre-diabetic she's got big red blood cells and a high rdw which are associated with higher mortality risk so we have this biomarker data can it be improved now an a meta-analysis of randomized control trials or rcts daiya phi dietary fiber intake improves kidney function including reductions for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and it's been shown to reduce glucose and if you want to look at those studies that included the do is here now she the the dietary data and the study wasn't great they just talked about what food she ate they didn't provide calorie intake or you know macronutrients protein fat carbs fiber minerals vitamins mineral content they didn't provide that data they just had a sentence or two about what she ate and how often and they reported that she rarely ate sugar and desserts but that she frequently consumed bread and pasta and i'm guessing this is white bread and white pasta which are nutrient poor compared to whole-wheat pasta then you could even make the argument that why whole-grain breads and pastas are nutrient poor compared to your vegetables so if she exchanged the these foods bread and pasta for higher fiber containing foods including vegetables would we see improvements for a kidney function and glucose that would be my obvious thing
