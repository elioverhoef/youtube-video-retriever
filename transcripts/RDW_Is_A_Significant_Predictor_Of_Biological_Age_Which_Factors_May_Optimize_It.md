The rdw percentage is a significant predictor of biological age and that's what we can see here so this is these are the nine biomarkers and chronological age these are the predictors of biological age using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age so on the left we've got those 10 variables and on the right we've got how much they contribute to the prediction of biological age now if you had to guess probably glucose would be the most significant predictor or contributes the most to the prediction of biological age using any biological age test but using this test that's not true the top predictor or the biomarker that contributes most to the prediction of biological age using lavine's test is the red blood cell dist distribution with or rdw percentage so what is the rdw percentage so it's a measure of the standard deviation for red blood cell volume intuitively that still doesn't make any sense so visually we can see what that means here on the left we've got the situation where there's a low r w percentage in other words all the red blood cells or mostly all of the red blood cells are the same volume so the standard deviation for red blood cell volume is relatively small that's a low rdw percentage in contrast on the right you can see that there's a heterogeneous population of red blood cells in terms of size and volume with some that are very large and some that are very small a large volume and a small volume that will be a situation where there's a relatively higher rdw percentage all right so then what's optimal for the rdw percentage and also which factors may optimize it so first the rdw percentage increases during aging and that's what we can see here with rdw percentage on the y-axis plotted against age from about 20 to 95 years on the x and then we can see that there is this an age related increase for the rdw percentage now the significance of the age related increase for the rdw percentage is that a relatively higher level is associated with an increase all cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so there's a lot of different colored uh shapes on this plot and that's because the shapes different shapes red blue and green are the adjustments that the model was was included in the model for the association with for rdw percentage with all cause mortality risk now what i care about the most is the fully adjusted model and that's the data in green that included an adjust adjustment for demographics morbidities and other lab values and then in terms of what's significant uh we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and note that this is a study of 3.2 million people if anyone's come across a larger study for rdw and all cause mortality risk please post it in the comments and this study and all the other studies will be in the video description so in terms of what's significant we put up that hazard ratio at one red line at one and then when the 95% confidence interal that's the horizontal line to the left and right of the green circle when that's either completely below one or completely above one we have a significant association so in terms of that we can see that lowest all cause mortality risk was associated with an rdw percentage in the 11.4 to 12.6 range and then an increase significantly increased all cause mortality risk in this study was associated with rdw values that were greater than 13.7% now note that also very low values of the rdw less than 11.4 was significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk but you can see in the rd percentiles that was in .1 to 0 1% of the population in other words 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 had uh rdw levels that were less than 11.4% so very rare it's more likely when considering the age related increase for rdw to see relatively higher values compar when compared with values less than 11.4 all right so in terms of what's optimal for the rdw based on the all cause mortality data 11.4 to 12.6 and we considering the age in data we don't want it to be 115 118 122 125 that's still an age related increase we want to try to resist any age related increase for the rdw even within that quote unquote optimal range which then brings us to which factors may optimize the rdw so in at least one study the omega-3 index was associated with a relatively lower rdw which we'll get to in a second so first what is the omega-3 index that's the proportion of omega-3 fatty a including the sum of epa and dha that are found in red blood cell membranes and then in terms of the data we've got the rd% on the y- ais plotted against the omega-3 index on the x and here we can see that as the proportion of epa and dha in red blood cell membranes increases and that's up to about uh an o omega-3 percentage of about 5% we can see we can see that rdw percentage declines from about 13.8 to 13.5 and i've written but only within that range because we can see at higher omega-3 indexes up to more than 9% so more than 9% of the total fatty acids that are in red blood cell membranes were epa and dha the rdw per was still around 13.5 still too high when considering that the all cause mortality data suggests that 11.4 to 12.6 is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes now we can in contrast to measuring it uh measuring the omega-3 index epa and dha in red blood cell membranes plasma levels of epa and dha can be tracked and i've been doing that using io's atome metabolomics kit and if you want to measure your own plasma levels of omega-3 there's a discount link in the video description now i measured uh five times in 2023 but unfortunately only two of those tests i also did venopuncture in other words i have rdw values that i can correlate with plasma levels of omega-3 and of omega-3 epa and dha now i plan on testing at least five more times in 2024 in conjunction with all of those tests uh measuring the rdw on the same day so i'll be able to evaluate whether plasma levels of epa and dha are correlated or not with the rdw percentage in contrast i've been tracking diet since 2015 weighing all my food with a food scale logging it into chronometer and then putting that data manually into a spreadsheet so i can address the question is dietary om3 intake significantly correlated with the rdw percentage and since 2015 i have 46 blood tests over that period so what is that data have to show and that's what we'll see here so on the y axis we've got the rdw percentage plotted against my average daily omega-3 intake in grams and for those who are new to the channel or who may be unfamiliar for two blood tests say there's a 60-day period in between because i'm tracking diet every day and i know my dietary intake the average dietary intake for that 60-day period then corresponds with the latter test so every blood test has a corresponding average daily dietary intake and because i now have up to 50 tests from many of these blood biomarkers i can look at correlations in the data to see which aspect of diet maybe driving blood biomarkers and i try to improve the blood biomarkers to move them towards health and youth by altering diet by following the correlations so when considering the uh the the data here average daily omega-3 intake versus the rdw percent percentage we can see that there's a significant inverse correlation in other words for relatively high average daily omega-3 intakes that correspond to blood test the rdw is lower in contrast when my average daily dietary omega-3 intake was lower the rdw that was cor significant correlated with a higher rdw going in the wrong direction but another variable has a stronger correlation with the rdw percentage and that's calorie intake which is is what we'll see here so same setup rdw percentage on the y axis but now on the x we've got average daily calorie intake and here we can see a significant positive correlation between average daily calorie intake with the rdw percentage with that correlation coefficient of 0.68 compared to the netive 0.41 for the uh omega-3 daily omega-3 intake and note that the p value in both situations is less than 0.05 so we have a significant uh correlation so in other words when calorie intake is relatively higher that's significant correlated with a higher rdw at least in my data and when calorie intake is relatively lower that's been significantly correlated with lower rdw a lower rdw percentage all right so this raises the question though is a lower calorie intake driving the significant correlation for dietary omega-3 with the rd rdw percentage in other words after adjusting for calorie intake is dietary omega-3 significantly correlated with the rdw percentage so to address that i derived a multivariant linear regression model which sounds a lot more fancy than it is in that model we've got omega-3 and calories so after adjusting for calorie intake is omega-3 average daily omega-3 intake significally correlated with the rdw and as we can see there it's not so this suggests that if the goal is to reduce the rdw at least in my data reducing calorie intake may be beneficial all right that's all for
