# NAD Test #2: Impact of NMN?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

What's my intracellular level of nad to address that question in january and using ginfinity's test we saw that my nad level was 25.6 micromolar which then raises the question is that youthful or age so using ginfinity's cutoffs we saw that my 25.6 micro molar falls into the age category at least based on how intracellular levels of nad change during aging in contrast having values higher than 40 micromolar would be youthful so with that in mind as soon as i got these results i started in a men's supplementation 300 milligrams per day and for those that are interested in the brand i was able to get some from nootropics depot now if you're interested in why nmn and not niacin i cover that in an earlier video so that will be in the right corner now two days later i switched to ginfinity's brand of nmn under some concern for product purity i don't know how pure nootropics depot is if anybody does please leave a comment but jinfinity uh ensured that their nmn was highly pure so i switched two days later again to 300 milligrams of nmn per day so with that in mind for test number two was there an impact of nmn 300 milligrams per day on my intracellular level of nad so 21 days later on february 21st i retested and we can see that my intracellular level of nad was essentially the same 25.3 micromolar so my nad levels are still low relatively low despite having nad as a supplement so as soon as they got these data i then switched to one gram of nman per day and i started out on february 28th and my next test for nad and everything else that i usually measure will be on march 6th so i'll have one week of one gram per day of nmn and we'll see if it makes an impact on nad but also on the full spectrum of blood biomarkers that i commonly report on this channel all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount link for nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so the this link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
