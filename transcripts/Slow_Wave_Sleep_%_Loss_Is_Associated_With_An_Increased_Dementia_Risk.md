# Slow Wave Sleep % Loss Is Associated With An Increased Dementia Risk

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In today's video we'll see that slow wave sleep percentage loss over time is associated with an increased dementia risk but first let's do a quick introduction including which sleep stage is s sws or slow wve sleep and that's what we can see here this is a sleep histogram so starting from being awake we pass through rem sleep after rem sleep is stage one in stage two sleep which is considered light sleep and after that we go into stage three and stage four sleep which is slow wave sleep now in the first half of the night most of the slow wave sleep happens there as you can see by the green horizontal arrows and in the second half of the night while asleep you can see that slow wave sleep is considerably less if at all whereas the majority of the time that was spent in slow wave sleep is now spent in rem sleep so with that in mind note that slow wave sleep percentage which is defined as slow wave sleep the total divided by the total sleep time that declines during aging and that's what we can see here this is a meta analysis of 65 studies and if you're interested in any of the papers that are referenced in this video they'll be in the video's description so on the y-axis we've got slow wve sleep percentage again the slow wave sleep amount divided by total sleep time and that's plotted against age on the x and this study included uh people from 5 years old up to 90 years old and here we can see that slow wave sleep in youth is about an average of 25% well that's in 5-year-old so for about a 20-year-old it's about 20% but note that age related trend line you can see that it declines during aging such that a 90-year-old the average value for s sws percentage is only 8% now the importance of the age related decline for slow weave slow wave sleep percentage loss is that it's associated with an increased dementia risk as i mentioned earlier and that's what we can see here this is in a recently published paper so on the y-axis we've got the cumulative dementia incidence so it's not just incidence of alzheimer's disease related dementia it's also vascular dementia and any other dementias and that was plotted against follow-up time and you can see that starting from the initial assessment of slow wave sleep about 17 with an average 17 years later how how many people had were diagnosed with dementia or not so when compared with people who exhibited a slow wave sleep percentage decrease over that 17 average 17-year period they had a higher incident risk of being diagnosed with dementia when compared with people who had a sws percentage that was stable or actually increased over time now note that a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and apologies apologies if i said that you've heard me say that a billion times over the last few videos but that's also a ma major premise of the channel so with that in mind slow wave sleep percentage can be tracked and one way to track it is by using fitness trackers now i've got whoop up here and i'm going to show whoop data in comparison against poly polysomnography psg which is a gold standard for sleep studies and i'm not here to promote whoop that's not the point of the video the if there are other fitness trackers uh aa apple watch garmin fitbit etc that have been compared against psg for their ability to quantify individual sleep stages including slow wave sleep and total sleep time please po post those papers in the comments uh and i'll be happy to compare and potentially include that data in a future video just focusing on other fitness trackers and and their ability to quantify slow wave sleep and total sleep time in this video i'm only going to focus on whoop data as i've worn that for more than 5 years so let's see what the data has has to show so here we're going to look at individual sleep stage data in terms of minutes per night and again this study i'll put this uh the the link to this paper in the video's description and we're going to compare it whoop against psg again polysomnography which is a gold standard for sleep studies and that's in part because we uh people get all electroded and and strapped and and deviced up you can see see on the finger it's a pulse oxymetry and the net sum of these electrodes monitor brain waves but also eye and muscle movements heart rate heart rate breathing respiratory effort and oxygen saturation so again psg long story short is that it's the gold standard for sleep studies in terms of quantifying individual sleep stages and total sleep time so how does whoop compare so what we care about with focus on this video is slow wave sleep duration so whoop in this study was able to quantify 80 minutes an average of 80 minutes per subject whereas psg calculated it as 84 minutes and we can see looking at the p value that those two groups of data were not significantly different so what that indicates is that whoop is as good as the gold standard psg for detecting and quantifying slow wave sleep but what about total sleep time because we'll need that to calculate the slow wave sleep percentage so that's we can see here whoop calculated 359 minutes per person person on average psg calculated 350 about 350 minutes per person on average and these data too were not significantly different so from this plot we can see that whoops slow wave sleep and total sleep time calculations are as good as the gold standard for sleep studies which is psg now where whoop is not great is for uh quantifying rem sleep and we can see that whoop in this study calculated 104 minutes on average per person whereas psg calculated 89 minutes on average per person and this was a significant difference in other words whoop overestimated rem sleep uh overestimated it by about 15 what do we got there it's uh 16 minutes or so per person so if the goal is to track ram sleep over time whoop may not be the best bet for that but in terms of slow wave sleep and total sleep time as good as the gold standard psg so with that in mind what's my data as i mentioned i've been tracking i've been wearing woop for many years so i have data for slow wave sleep and total sleep time sorry so i can calculate the slow wave sleep percentage and we can see if i've declined or not during aging so here we're going to take a look at again slow wave sleep percentage from may of 2019 through early november 2023 and you can see that little n is this is more than 1600 days of data which is what we'll see here so i'm only going to go through year-by-year averages but note that each dot refers to an a single day's worth of data so in 2019 average slow wave sleep percentage was 21.2% in 2020 the average full year average 21 21.3% and rather than just looking at year-to-year averages superficially they don't look different we can evaluate that with a two sample t test so when doing that these two groups of data 2019 vers 2020 not significantly different so at least no age related decline year-over-year 2019 versus 2020 in 2021 average was uh 21.5% and again using that two sample t test not different from 2020 so no age related decline for at least 2 years starting with the 2019 as my baseline but then in 2022 i was able to increase it to 24.1% and that's significantly better than 20 uh 2021 and similarly thus far in 2023 i've been able to increase it a bit further to 24.8% and again when evaluating it uh statistically to sample t test the p value is 0.2 so less than 0.05 in other words 2023 data is uh significant longer than 2022 data so the net sum of this these data is that i've significantly increased slow wave sleep percentage since 2019 which is potentially good news especially in terms of dementia risk which for people that exhibited a slow wave sleep percentage decline over time they were at a higher risk for being di diagnosed with dementia relative to people whose slow wave sleep percentage was stable or actually increased over time so then the next question is how so one variable that may be underlying these these data is body weight and here we're going to take a look at correlations for slow wave sleep percentage with body weight as i have daily body weight data that corresponds to slow wave sleep percentage over that 1600 day or so period and that's what we can see here so so on the y- axis we've got slow wave sleep percentage plotted against body weight in pounds and note that uh my fasted body weight i record that uh every morning after using the bathroom so what we can see on this plot is a significant inverse correlation you can see that p values less than 0.05 and the correlation coefficient the little r is negative and what this suggests is or what this shows is that a relatively higher body weight is significantly correlated with a lower slow wave sleep percentage in my data it may be different for others conversely a relatively lower body weight is significantly correlated with a higher slow wave sleep percentage and over the past two or 2 and a half to 3 years i've been slowly reducing body weight which may be one factor that's underlying the improvements uh in slow wave sleep percentage over that three or so year time span now even within body weight we can further subdivide that into calorie intake because maintenance of body weight is going to involve are you in a caloric excess caloric you know deficit uh but then we can further subdivide calorie intake into diet composition what's a diet composition that may correlate with slow wave sleep or does it at all maybe it's just calorie intake and body weight and then also inherent in the body weight calculation is daily activity levels so i intend on covering each of these in a future video correlations with slow wave sleep percentage so we can really get after is it body weight is it calorie intake is it is it total activity levels stay tuned for that in a future video all right that's all for now
