# Blood Test #3 in 2022: Supplements, Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Last month i blood tested for the third time in 2022 and when using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator we saw that my biological age was 14 years younger than my chronological similarly using aging.eye 17 years younger than my chronological so what's contributing to these data what about supplements so in terms of supplements there were three uh first levothyroxine i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine for the past 20 plus years vitamin d a thousand ius per day every day during the 56 day period that corresponded to blood test number three and then a little bit of melatonin note that that's about 53 micrograms per day not milligrams but micrograms so occasional very small amounts of melatonin at night and that's it for supplements no signal linux or gyro protectors so what about diet so in terms of diet uh since 2015 i've weighed literally all of my food with a food scale and those food amounts are then entered into chronometer and chronometer is a food tracking app that i've used since 2015. I can't say which is the best but that's what i've used so along those lines if you want to get a chronometer membership discount link it'll be in the video's description all right so when considering that i've tracked my diets in 2015 what's the diet composition including macronutrients micronutrients and individual foods that corresponds to this blood test so let's dig into the approach in march more specifically march 14th i blood tested for the second time in 2022 and on march uh may 9th i blood tested for the third time so in between blood tests is a 56 day period so the average intake for those 56 days including macro and micronutrients and individual food amounts correspond to test number three's diet composition and i then enter that data into a spreadsheet now i've done this for uh since 2015 and i have up to 37 blood tests since 2015. So because each blood test now has corresponding dietary data i can calculate correlations between diet with 24 big picture as i like to call them blood biomarkers which are representative of many organ systems and other things like glucose insulin sensitivity etc so i can calculate correlations between diet with these big picture blood biomarkers and then are the significant correlations the ones that have a p-value less than 0.05 going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk now in this video i won't detail how the the directionality of the biomarkers in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk but if you're interested in that data just leave a comment and i'll direct you to where i've shown that data in other videos and then note that following these correlations may be important for optimizing not only the blood biomarkers but we can get towards a more direct approach for precision nutrition in other words optimizing diet while also optimizing blood biomarkers so let's have a look at the diet composition that corresponds to this blood test and see how well i'm following these correlations so first calorie intake so for the 56 day period that corresponded to blood test number three my average calorie intake was 23 23 calories per day and when doing the analysis for the big big picture biomarkers with calorie intake since 2015 the net correlative score is negative six so what does that mean and let's dig into that a little bit more so here we're looking at correlations for calorie intake with big picture biomarkers and a few notes uh n little ant little n next to each biomarker is how many blood tests that i have for that biomarker so for example for glucose we see n equals 35 that means i have 35 individual data points for glucose since 2015. Similarly for homocysteine i have 19 blood tests creatinine 37 etc and then the little r at the top left column is the correlation and then next to that as the p-value which is the measure of statistical significance and if it's less than 0.05 it's a significant correlation so the net correlative score of negative six is up there and that's because we can see that calorie intake is significantly correlated with this these six biomarkers and again it won't go into direct directionality but note that each of these are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk in other words a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher levels of each of these biomarkers which again are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk now note that when there is a net negative correlative score that suggests that i should eat below my average intake since 2015 using the data that i have since 2015. Now based on these data test number three's calorie intake was 2323 which was purposefully below my average intake since 2015 which is 25.59 so for that i give a check which means that i'm following the correlations just to note if i wasn't following that correlation or the net correlative score with a higher calorie intake say i was eating 2 700 calories that would be that i'm not following the correlations because the data suggests that i i should eat below my average intake not above it which would probably lead to worse biomarker data at least based on the net correlative score now a couple of other situations are possible when there's a neutral correlative score so an equal amount of biomarkers going in the right and wrong direction in that case i would eat my average intake since 2015 and in the situation when there's a net positive correlative score i would eat above my average intake for that for that given nutrient or food even uh since 2015. So let's take it let's look at more examples so again this is the average intake for uh test number three for the 56 day period that corresponds to that test and we're looking at my protein intake that corresponds to test number three which was about 99 grams per day now that too has a net correlative score of minus six and i won't go through each of the biomarkers that it was significantly correlated with if you're interested in that data just leave a comment and i'll indicate which we're going in the right and wrong direction and i may actually do a live stream at some point with each of the correlations for each individual macro or micronutrient so that you can actually see what's what's going in the right direction and what's going the wrong direction all right so protein has a net correlative score with these big picture biomarkers of negative six and that suggests that protein intake below my average intake again since 2015 may be optimal for my blood biomarkers now my average protein intake since 2015 is 113 grams per day so 99 is less than 113 so for that i am following the correlations again if i was eating above 113 because of that negative correlative score that would expect to lead to more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so to minimize that eating below my average may minimize the potential adverse effects of too high of a protein intake on multiple biomarkers or multiple blood biomarkers all right so as an approach for optimizing blood biomarkers how well am i following the correlations with diet let's go even further besides just calorie intake and and protein let's take a look at carbohydrate intake so on the right we've got the net correlative score and on the left we've got my average intake for each of these uh macronutrients since 2015. And no first note at the top of the list is fiber and based on the usda dietary guidelines uh for someone in my chronological age group what's recommended is a fiber intake of about 33 grams per grams per day so we can see that for this blood test my average fiber intake was 86 grams per day so what about the net correlative score so there we can see that my the the net correlative score for fiber is plus two which uh and when considering my average intake is 97 with a positive net correlative score that suggests that for uh i should be eating above actually uh 97 grams per day to have a net positive effect potentially have a net positive effect on the blood biomarkers but i was below that for this test at 86 so that gets a an x i need to do a better job of fiber intake and try to get it closer and above 97 grams per day so this goes beyond this approach goes beyond the rda by using this approach we can actually see you know how much is optimal beyond just following general recommendations how much should we eat using this biomarker based analysis all right so next up total sugars so for that i track total fructose intake because i have tendency to eat a a lot of fruit and in terms of fructose total fructose intake that's equal to fructose plus sucrose divided by two because fructose is half fructose so for that we can see that the net correlative score for total fructose is minus three which suggests that i should eat below my average of 87 grams per day which was again since 2015. So for this test the total fructose with fructose plus fructose sucrose divided by two was 62 grams per day so that's below 87 so for that i am following the correlations and we get a check all right for net carbs net correlative score of plus 2 that suggests i should eat above my average intake of 235 grams per day and i did for this test with 257 since 257 is higher than 235 so that two gets a check all right so what about lipids so again on the right we've got the net correlative score and then the average intake on the left so we'll go through these one by one and then i'll start to show all the rest of the micronutrient micronutrients by just showing large patterns so first total fat net correlative score of minus seven which suggested i should be eating below my average intake which was 86 grams per day so for this test i averaged about 81 grams per day so that gets a check so because i'm i'm following the correlations a net negative score suggests i should be eating below my average intake so fat can be further subdivided into mono and polyunsaturated fats so monounsaturated fats have a net negative a net correlative score of minus one which which suggests i should eat below my average intake of 17 grams per day so for this test to average 16 grams per day which is below 17 so that too gets a check so polyunsaturated fatty acids can be divided into omega-3 and omega-6 both omega-3 and omega-6 have net positive correlative scores which suggest i should be above my average average intake so we can see that for omega-3 eight is higher than seven so that gets a check and then similarly for omega-6 17 is higher than 16 so that too gets a check so then for saturated fat we can see a net negative uh score of minus seven net correlated score of minus seven so a lot more biomarkers blood biomarkers going the wrong direction than right in correlation with a higher saturated fat intake so that data suggests i should eat below my average intake of 27 grams per day so i did for this test at 21 grams per day so that gets a check and then last but not least even though this could qualify as a micronutrient cholesterol has a net negative score of minus nine again suggesting i should be below my average intake of 132 milligrams per day so for this test i average 34 milligrams per day which again is below my average intake and i'm following the correlations so to summarize for macros nine out of these ten situations i'm following them except for fiber so for the next test again i'm going to try to bump my fiber intake even higher than it was for this test uh 86 grams per day to try to also follow all of the correlations for macros all right so what about vitamins so we've got them listed here and then we can see their net correlative scores and then starting from the top just to just to go through this um so thiamin b1 vitamin b1 net correlated score of one which suggests i should need higher than two milligrams per day but it was exactly two milligrams per day so that gets an x riboflavin's data suggests i should eat below my average intake but i was above it so that gets an x and then we can see niacin and i've put the rdas here just for reference because my niacin intake is two and a half times the rda and you know this again goes to this idea of how much is optimal and this approach can also be used for supplements in comparison with blood biomarkers to see how much of a given supplement may be optimal now in my case my niacin intake is not based on supplements it's whole food and we can see that the net correlative score for niacin is plus six which suggests that i can go even higher than my average intake of 35 milligrams per day which i did in this case for uh niacin with 40 milligrams per day so it gets a check similarly uh vitamin b5 net positive score plus 2 11.1 is higher than my average intake of 11 so that gets a check and then we can see a net neutral score for vitamin b6 now my average intake has been seven milligrams per day for b6 for this test it was 3.3 milligrams so that actually gets an x which suggests that i can go higher now i've supplemented with b6 in the past and when considering this data suggests that i closer to seven may be optimal or somewhere in between three and seven may be optimal uh i'm considering reintroducing vitamin b6 supplements into the approach now in terms of that supplement supplementation approach and here we can see b12 which i have supplemented with many times for many tests in in the past and b12 has a net correlative score of minus six but a lot more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right now my average b12 intake is 571 micrograms per day which you definitely can't get from diet alone in fact uh my 10 micrograms per day was diet alone for this test so when considering that b12 has a net correlative score of minus six that suggests i should eat below the 571 which i did so i'm following that correlation so the folate story is similar to b6 it's got a net neutral score which suggests that my more than 1100 micrograms of folate for this test can go higher somewhere up to about 1500 micrograms per day and that too to get to those levels i've used methylfolate as a supplement so i may actually consider including that again in the near future okay and then last on the chart is vitamin a and it's related carotenoids so vitamin a overall total vitamin a has a positive score of plus one which suggests i can go higher than 105 uh about 105 000 iu's per day and again note that the rda is only 3 000 and i'm way above that and we'd expect that if being way above the rda was bad for the biomarkers i would see very strong negative net correlative scores for example using vitamin a and that's not what we see we see a net correlative score of plus one which suggests that i can go even higher than where it was for this test about 95 000 iu now vitamin a divides into the five main carotenoids and here we can see that uh within that alpha and beta-carotene have net negative correlative scores so that suggests i should eat below my average intake which i did for both of these uh carotenes 12 000 for alpha carotene so i'm following that correlation uh so i'm following the correlation for alpha carotene and similarly beta carotene i'm following that too as a 50 000 micrograms is below 54 000 and eating below the the average intake is suggested based on that net correlative score of minus 6. Now in contrast beta cryptoxanthin has a net positive correlative score of plus three which suggests that i should eat above my average intake of 4 300 micrograms but for this test i was at 1671. So going forward i'm going to reintroduce butternut squash but in relatively small amounts because i have a tendency to eat just way too much of it so uh let's see how those correlations look in future blood tests so to finish up the vitamins we've got net correlative score average intake since 2015 and then just going through the first four we can see that i didn't follow them or i need to increase uh sorry i need to decrease um my levels of lycopene because i have a negative correlative score and i need to increase my lutein plus zeaxanthin even though it's relatively high at 23 000 micrograms per day i'm following the correlations for vitamin c and vitamin d but the one i really want to want to point out here is a vitamin e so vitamin e has a net correlated score of minus eight and even though 20 milligrams per day is higher than the rda the net score of -8 suggests that less than my average of 25 is what i should be doing less than you know eating less than my average may be optimal based on that net correlative score so with that in mind i'm at 20 milligrams per day so for whatever reason too much dietary vitamin e is associated or significantly correlated with many more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right now in contrast vitamin k has a net positive correlative score and note that my average vitamin k intake that corresponds to this test was about 14 times higher than the rda and again if intakes that high were bad for the biomarkers or quote-unquote bad for health we'd expect to see relatively super physiological doses and again this is from diet not supplements but we'd expect to see overall net negative correlative scores for example vitamin e but that's not true in the case of vitamin k which has a net positive score which suggests that i should eat above my average intake of 1500 micrograms per day and i did that for this test so that gets a check all right so uh let's go through the minerals real quick we've got the net correlative scores and we can see that uh it's a mixed bag some of them i'm following the correlations and others i can do better so to summarize the micronutrient summary i'm following the ones the most negative and most positive so for example vitamin e has a net score of minus eight calcium minus seven niacin i think was plus six so i've been following the strongest positive and negative correlations thinking that because they're correlated with so many going in the wrong or right direction that following those should have the biggest impact on my biomarkers but improvement for many others is possible as we can see by all of the red x's now if i do a better job for for getting these micronutrients to also follow the correlations well my biological age using the venus test and aging.ai and other blood biomarkers you know looking beyond just the simple biological age calculators but really getting towards that you know biochemistry of youth will they be further improved all right so what about food composition um what does that look like for test number three so we can see that here this is the average uh daily dietary intake for the 56 day period that corresponded to test number three in 2022 so i ate uh 45 different foods and i won't go through you know the amounts in which you know top 10 and all that but what i want to point out is that even though i'm on a mostly whole food-based diet i do have chites or cheat meals and we can see that here and it's important to raise this point because someone in a forum saw this data and maybe didn't watch the whole video and thought that i literally eat five grams of ice cream sandwiches or five grams of caramels every day and that's not the case when i do have a cheat meal it's like immediately after the blood test i have it and i'll eat a relatively large amount maybe a thousand calories and then i'll also do that on the day after the test and then i do my best to shut it down literally no junk until the next blood test so in this case it was 54 days that i had literally no junk after the first two days of having the ice cream sandwiches and caramels now this approach works best for me i once a week doesn't work for me once every two weeks this is what i've developed over time again that works best for me and also as i guess a little bit of junk you can see gum on the list i chew gum during my standard 70 to 80 minute workout i don't know why it's just uh you know it's just the thing i've always done so other than that it's whole foods as you can see based on the list all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
