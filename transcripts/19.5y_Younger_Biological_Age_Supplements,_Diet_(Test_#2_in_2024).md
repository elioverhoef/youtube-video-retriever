# 19.5y Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Test #2 in 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that my biological age when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator feno age was 19 and a half years younger than my chronological so what may be contributing to these data so let's start off with supplements and if you're familiar with the channel the first two shouldn't be a surprise so i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking prescription levothyroxin 1375 microgr per day every day since then and then for about 8 to 9 months months a year as i live in boston northeast latitude i supplement with vitamin d relatively low dose 1,000 ius per day and note that that was for 49 of the 49 days for every day that corresponded to this blood test so what is that 49-day period well we can see that it was from january 15th that's immediately after test number one in 2024 and that lasts until march 3rd which is the day before test number two so that's a 49-day period from one test to the next all right two other supplements methyl b12 1,000 microgram per day but i didn't use it every day of the 49 days only 30 of the 49 days as i'm still playing around with the dose to see if it actually does anything in terms of homosysteine and then i also supplemented with nicotinic acid 50 to 60 milligram per day but that too it wasn't in the approach every day it was only in the approach for 18 of the 49 days as i was trying various experiments including feny greek seeds chickpeas and other ways to increase na potentially increase nad without nicotinic acid and that's it no other purported ger protectors orol linux which brings us to diet more specifically what diet composition corresponds to test number two two in 2024 and that's what we'll see here and again this is the 49-day test average and for those who don't know i weigh all my food i log that data into chronometer and then i manually record that into a spreadsheet i take the average diet dietary intake for that 49 days period i line it up with blood test data and because i have almost 50 blood tests going back to 2015 i can look at correlations and then follow the correlations with the goal of optimizing biomarkers so in terms of the list the full list is shown here we can see that i ate 56 different foods during the 49-day period that corresponded to this test in terms of the list it's ranked in grams from highest to lowest with the exception of green tea which is an ounces and i use organic loose leaf green tea sourced from from japan if you want to use what i use there'll be a discount link in the video's description all right so were there any experiments for this test and fair warning i should say buckle in we're going to take a deep dive on all of the different things that i changed that may have played a role in further reducing my biological age using lavine's test to 19 1 12 years i'll put time stamps in the pined comment for those who may be uh interested in you know sifting through the video rather than watching it from start to finish all right so the first one i want to focus on is garlic and garlic at 2.6 an average of 2.6 g per day may not seem like much but that's approximately 2x higher than the average for the 49-day period that corresponded to the first test in 2024 1.4 g per day both of those intakes are higher than my average since 2015 which is only .5 gram per day so why did i raise garlic intake so garlic is significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age and actually i should say it's one of only two foods or nutrients that has a p value less than 0.05 for its correlation with horath epigenetic age and if you're interested in full correlations uh full correlation lists with biomarkers that's on the correlations tier on patreon so in terms of the correlation between horvath epigenetic age versus garlic intake we can see that here over 12 tests so far for horvath that's what we've got on the y-axis horvath epigenetic age plotted against the average daily garlic intake and again this is the average intake from one day to the next in this case for this test it was a 49-day average in terms of the correlation we can see that it's a significant inverse correlation for average daily garlic intake with horvath horvath epigenetic age in other words we can see that the correlation coefficient the lowercase r is 0.59 and that p value is less than 0.05 as the measure of statistical significance so when considering this correlation what happens if i go higher if this correlation is really somehow causatively involved and again i don't know that it's causation i can it's only a correlation the only way to test causation is by actually increasing or decreasing level of this food so that's what i did i increased it to 2.6 gam per day and we'll see the data is not yet in results are expected at the end of uh march if i was able to reduce horath epigenetic age if i was this correlation will strengthen if i wasn't then this correlation will weaken and whatever pops up is the strongest correlation or group of correlations i'll try to follow all of them with the goal of reducing my horvath epigenetic age all right so back to the which experiments that i do for this test so i also added alalas sprouts into the approach so why alfalfas sprouts are a good source of trigonelline 181 micrograms per gram of alphalpha sprouts and trigonelline increases nad at least in mice i'm still not convinced or i don't yet have any data that it increases nad at least in me after a few tests in testing nad so in terms of the uh amount of alal alala sprouts 25 grams per day for an average 49-day period may not seem like a lot but for eight days prior to this test on march 4th i averaged 132 gram of alaffa sprouts per day and i should mention it got expensive at $5 for 100 g to buy them from the grocery store so i'm now growing my own sprout and sprouting once every about 4 days uh yielding about 700 gr at a far cheaper cost so the al falfa sprouts for those eight days yielded 24 milligram of trigonelline per day now i i also added other foods into the diet during this period with the goal of increasing trigonelline including green peas snow peas shoots fenugreek seeds which made a small appearance for about 10 or 11 days with the goal of increasing trinell to try to increase nad and in some these foods provided 48 milligrams of trigonelline per day now to put it in into perspective remember just 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid raises or raise my ned to 39 micromolar which is higher than my baseline which is usually less than 26 so that 40 48 milligrams of trigonelline may not seem like much but it could impact nad so when compared with the first test in 2024 trigonelline content average daily trigonelline content was only 27 milligrams per day so i was able to increase it for this test and then the big question is was ned increased or was it impacted at all and that video will be in one of the next two videos i haven't decided if it's next or the one after that all right so in order to get these calories into the diet in order to stay slightly below my normal calorie intake i had to reduce other foods and those foods were barley and oats and if you're familiar with the channel and you're familiar with these diet composition videos that correspond to blood test barley notes are generally around 30 grams each in my diet so you can see that i've reduced them both to five grams each in order to get again the other stuff that has calories into the diet without going above my maintenance calorie intake and actually trying to stay a little bit below so i can get to my leanest all right so i also try to increase methyl donors with the goal of reducing homosysteine now when it comes to methyl donors most people think about trimethyl glycine or betane now the most concentrated source of tmg in my diet comes from beets which contains 750 microgram of tmg per gram and i'll put the link to the studies that have bain content in various foods in the video's description so for this test beats average was about 257 g per day and that's up from 232 g per day for test number one so a 25 g increase now that might not seem like much but for 11 days before this test i increased beats to 3 102 g per day so that that increase in beats by about 70 g per day yielded an additional 53 mig of tmg per day now i should mention i try to for those who don't already know i try to use diet to impact the biomarkers first i've tried up to four grams of tmg per day in the past it didn't have an impact on homosysteine at all so i'm not convinced that supplementation will be the way to go but i'm also not convinced that diet will be the way to go in terms of reducing homo cyan as i've not been very successful to this point so in terms of tmg quinoa is also a great source as it contains 61 micrograms per gram so with that in mind quinoa made an appearance in the diet we can see it there but not a big appearance you can see that's only an average of 2.3 grams per day and it wasn't until i realized that quinoa is a rich source of oxalates and i'm trying to reduce oxalates or if i'm going to add foods into the approach and they have a significant amount of oxalates hopefully they have an even larger amount of calcium and that too was on the video to-do list to compare oxalate absorption in the in the presence of calcium now tmg isn't the only place we can get methyl donors and in an earlier video i covered proline betane which has methyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom just like tmg has nitrogen uh methyl groups attached to glycine's u nitrogen atom so in terms of proline betan in the last video that corresponded to blood test number one in 2024 we saw that i added oranges into the approach so i didn't increase them for this test but for those who may have missed it i reduced strawberry intake in order to get the oranges into the approach now alfalfa sprouts are also a good source of proline betane especially if when considering that i ate 132 gram per day for you know the about week or so before the test alalas sprats have 70 micrograms per gram so that also contributed a small uh but a decent amount of proline betane to the methyl donor pool but but then also tryptophan betan so same story the nitrogen atom of the amino acid tryptophan has methyl groups attached to it that can potentially act as methyl donors to potentially reduce homosysteine there are three main sources of tryptophan beane including chickpeas peanuts and lentil so chickpeas were already in approach and i'm probably going to keep them in for at least a few more tests as that's significally correlated with lower creatinine and that may be one reason why my creatinine over the past few tests has trended towards below average which is is good because creatinine increases during aging i also increased peanut in intake with the goal of getting more tryptophan bane we can see that i increased it by 14 gram per day peanuts i'm going to keep them too relatively high going forward as they were they are inversely correlated with the sum of the liver enzymes alt and a which may be one reason why they moved in the right direction relative to their higher values for test number one now i also added lentils into the approach but i finally realized that i'm not generally a fan of lentils in terms of their taste so unfortunately i took them out and note that in terms of trip toan beane they are the most concentrated source relative to chickpeas and peanuts but yet i just can't do it i mean uh i've got to be able to include foods that i like in order to have them longterm in the approach rather than have foods with the nutritional content and i just don't enjoy it all right so in terms of the sum of methylated amino acids and that also includes trigonelline it was 31 11 mg per day for this test in in comparison for test number one it was 246 milligram per day so that's about a 25% increase in the methyl donor pull so then the big question is did i reduce homocysteine and unfortunately not for this test on the same day of testing it was 11 micromolar and for comparison for the previous 15 tests my average homosysteine is 10.4 micromolar so it actually went in the wrong direction despite a higher amount of potential methyl donors how i'm going to reduce homosysteine going forward that'll be a story for another day now some other highlights that i changed for foods in the diet uh cocoa beans cacao beans i doubled their intake so from 1.5 to 3 gram per day and again that might not seem like much but we don't know the dose of foods or nutrients that may be needed to make a dent on biomarkers in my data cocoa beans are significantly correlated with lower mcv so that may be one reason why mcv moved towards more youthful values for this test by increasing cocoa beans and then i also increased vanilla bean intake from once a week to once every 3 days and i did that because as we'll see in an upcoming video vanillin inhibits or uh inhibits growth and can kill off an oral microb known as sadium maresin which has been dominant in my oral microbiome for many tests so i haven't yet made that video about whether vanillin in a mouthwash could uh eliminate sadia from my oral microbiome but when're considering that vanilla beans are a rich s source of vanillin i think it makes sense to not only have it in the mouthwash but then also to have it ingested and then my salivary glands can secreted into my mouth and potentially reduce sadia levels and then i also added in sunflower seeds so sunflower seeds made random appearances here and there over the past eight or so years in the diet but when considering that almonds are rich source of vitamin e so are sunflower seeds but the difference is that almonds have relatively higher oxalates i i don't think oxalates are a problem for me right now because my calcium intake is about double that but i'm trying to limit my oxalate intake while keeping calcium levels relatively high with the goal of optimizing bone density uh during aging all right so the diet isn't perfectly clean i do generally try to limit uh my my cheat meals to no more than two per dietary period so no more than two for the 49-day period that corresponded to this test and in terms of what those cheat meals included it shouldn't be a big surprise i i'm big fan of reese's peanut butter cups so i make kind of a homemade version with uh melted chocolate with peanut butter and i sweetened it this time instead of sugar or sweet and condensed milk with honey now in terms of the calories that chocolate chips and honey which are generally nutrient po contributed for this 49-day period it's 9% of all calories so the diet is 99.1% clean all right so this list is ranked in grams what about foods in terms of calories in terms of how they rank in the diet and that's what we can see here so note first that these data are generated by chronometer and if you want to track your own diet using chronometer there'll be a discount link in the video's description so in terms of the food that contributed most to my calorie intake my daily calorie intake as as it has been for many tests it's sardines basically the cornerstone of my diet in terms of the other nine foods nine of the 10 foods that are on this list were also the same for test number one in 2024 peanuts entered the list pistachios came out i didn't reduce pistachio intake but because i increased peanuts from test one to test two they now made the list and i should note too that i'm not trying to blow up the diet with the goal of improving a couple of biomarkers here and there biological age using lavine's pheno age and d and pace as another example are relatively youthful so it's a matter of keeping the overall structure while making small changes where possible while keeping the overall structure in terms of protein total fat and even the foods that i include all right so that brings us to macronutrients what macronutrient corresponds to this test so let's start off with calorie intake which averaged 27 276 per day and if i know for those who are familiar with the channel i've been saying that for test over test over test but this is again my lowest average daily calorie intake since i since i started tracking diet in 2015 and my previous low was 2092 and for those who may not be familiar i've been trying to get as lean as possible and making very small calorie cuts over a long period of time which is why i've been saying for many tests this is now my lowest calorie intake my lowest calorie intake and i may dedicate a whole video just to reducing body weight cons being able to consistently reduce body weight with small calorie cuts over time just to illustrate the process protein intake average was 97 gram per day which is about 90% of total calories fat intake we can see that here i averaged 84 gram per day which is slightly up and we'll see why in a second in terms of percentage of calories it was 36% of total calories coming from fat now note that saturated fat at 19.6 gram isn't uh much different from test number one which was which was about 19 gram per day but for the past 3 weeks for the 3 weeks prior to this test my average saturated fat intake exclusively well almost exclusively from coconut butter was 25 gram per day and i did that because in my data saturated fat is significantly correlated with ldl and i'm not talking about crazy high just trying to push it towards the higher end of my range as that may be involved with a younger denan pace a younger epigenetic pace of aging so to test that hypothesis i raised my saturated fat intake for the 3 weeks prior to this test but also again note in terms of overall dietary structure we can see that omega-3 and omega 6 are exactly where they were for test number one in fact almost exactly where they've been for many tests going back you know uh uh at least a year and that goes back to this idea of not messing with the structure of things that may be core components of an overall mostly youthful biomarker profile all right next up carb intake and that's what we can see here total carbs at 274 gram per day that seems like a lot but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber fiber average was 88 gam per day so when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 187 g per day when multiplying that by 4 calories per gram the diet consisted of 36% of calories from net carbs and then also note that fiber contributes calories as soluble fiber within fiber there's insoluble that's not fermented by gut bacteria and then some of that about 25% an estimated 25% or so can be fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids in other words the fiber is converted into fat so with that in mind 185 calories coming from soluble fiber can be added to total fat and in terms of a percentage that's about 9% of total calories coming from fiber fermentation so with that we can see my net macros are about 45% fat 36% net carbs and about 19% protein all right now within sugar intake i also track total fructose as the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables which contain fructose so in terms of total fructose for this test it was about 6 61 gr per day note that fructose plus half of sucrose as sucrose is half fructose yields the total fructose amount in terms of 61 gram being a lot i know it seems like a lot but that's once again close to my lowest fructose intake since 2015 which is 57.5 gram per day and i've mentioned this in other videos but i've had total fructose intakes as high as almost double this so this is progress albeit not perfection all right so what about micronutrients what profile corresponds to this test and i won't spend a lot of time on that but first we've got uh vitamins and note as i've mentioned in other videos full rda coverage but then many of these are perp purposefully much higher than the rda as i'm following correlations with the biomarkers in other words for vitamin k if it has a positive correlation with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong in terms of how they relate to aging and all cause mortality risk i want to have vitamin k towards the higher end of my range because it's positively correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong in contrast things like beta car actually have a net negative correlative score so i don't aim for my highest intake since 2015 but somewhere below that all right and then last but not least mineral intake all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've
