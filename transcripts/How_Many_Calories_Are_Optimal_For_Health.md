How many calories are optimal for health one way to address that is by looking at correlations for average daily calorie intake with big picture biomarkers so what's the approach how can we do that so since april of 2015 i've weighed all of my food every day with a food scale and those food amounts are then entered into chronometer now note that i'm not sponsored by chronometer any similar uh app uh you know including myfitnesspal or others will work and then the output data from that including macro micronutrients and individual food amounts are entered into a spreadsheet now during that period from april of 2015 through november of 2021 i have up to 33 blood tests and then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if i blood test on day one and then blood test on day 60 for the 59 day period in between blood tests the average dietary intake during that period corresponds to the second blood test so with enough blood tests and enough dietary data we can then look at correlations for blood biomarkers with calorie intake or other macro micronutrients or individual food amounts and that can help us answer the question is calorie intake correlated with big picture biomarkers so what are the big picture biomarkers and that's what's shown here so they include things like glucose homocysteine three markers of kidney function for markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins immune cells red blood cell related measures inflammation including high sensitivity c-reactive protein and then as a composite measure of many of these biomarkers an overall biological age score using morgan levine's phenoage and aging.ai now first note that my average daily calorie intake is not significantly correlated with either of the two biologically scores including phenoage and aging.ai so in theory we could stop here you know many may may say well look your core your calorie intake is not significantly correlated with biological age so who cares just eat your average intake or eat whatever you want as much as you want and it doesn't matter but i prefer greater specificity and i think there's value in looking at each of the individual biomarkers and then seeing what is calorie intake significantly correlated both in a good direction and potentially in a wrong direction so which blood biomarkers are significantly correlated with calorie intake and there are four blood urea nitrogen bun vldl so very low density uh lipoprotein platelets and the red blood cell distribution with rdw now i should have noted that on this table the little n is how many blood tests that i have for each measure the little r is the correlation coefficient and the p value is the measure of statistical significance or not with a p-value less than 0.0.05 being statistically significant all right so then the next question is are these correlations going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk and then once we have that information we'll be able to guide calorie intake until the next blood test so basically using an evidence-based approach for uh calorie intake versus systemic biomarkers so start let's start with the the correlation that was the strongest so vldl has a correlation coefficient of 0.55 so that's where we'll start so the vldl reference range and this is using lab corps data is 5 to 40 milligrams per deciliter and the reference range doesn't tell us if we should be on the low end of the range in the middle of the range or the high end of the range in terms of what's optimal for health and potentially longevity so let's have a look at the aging data so vldl increases during aging and this is in a study of 3 100 men i presented this data in another video if you missed that i'll link to the right corner especially since that data also has uh data that video also has data for women which i won't present in this video because i'm only going to compare my data against what's been published so again if anybody's seen or come across studies larger than this study of 3 100 men for vldl changes during aging please post it in the comments and i'll give you a shout out in an upcoming video and probably use that data in in the video also all right so during aging starting from 15 year olds to 19 year olds and all the way up through 79 year olds we can see that vodl goes from about 16 to uh in the mid 30s and 20 to values that are about 29 in 75 to 79 year olds in other words it approximately doubles during aging starting from 15 years old so what about uh all-cause mortality risk well there isn't any data for all-cause mortality risk or at least i didn't come across any studies for vldl's association with all cause mortality risk but there is data in relatively large studies for its risk uh with uh its associated risk for uh acute myocardial myocardial infarction so heart attack sudden coronary death and other coronary death and as we can see by the title vldl greater than 20 is associated with an increased risk for all of these cardiovascular related outcomes which is what we can see here so in people that had vldl less than 20 we can see significantly higher risk for these coronary heart disease related outcomes for people that have vldl higher than 20. So when considering these data that lower is better especially less than 20 the significant correlation for my calorie intake with vldl in other words a higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher vldl this is going in the wrong direction so we can change that black arrow to red with red indicating going in the wrong direction all right so next up uh in terms of statistical significance and its correlation is the rdw so first what is the red blood cell distribution with so the easiest way to understand it is when there is a normal rdw all red blood cells have approximately the same size and volume but when there is a high rdw there there's a variability in red blood cell size and volume as you can see there are some red blood cells that are large in size and some that are small now the reference range lab corps reference range for already the rdw percentage is 11.6 to 15.4 but again that says nothing about should it be low should it be in the middle should it be high in terms of aging and minimizing risk of all-cause mortality risk so let's have a look at the aging data so uh what we're looking at here is rdw on the y-axis plotted against age and this is in a relatively small study again i wasn't able to come across any larger studies for rdw it's age for its age-related changes and if anyone has seen data for that please post it in the comments and again i'll give you a shout out i'll put that data in another video in a future video so what we can see is that there's a significant increase for rdw during aging all the way up through 95 years of age so what about all-cause mortality risk so in this case this is not a small study this is data in 3.2 million subjects and when compared with the hazard ratio of one when we have the 95 confidence interval that's completely below one we have significantly reduced risk or a confidence interval that's uh completely above one we have significantly increased all-cause mortality risk acm risk so what we can see is with the data group for rdw in percentiles we can see that the lowest risk was present for rdw values in the 8.1 to 12.5 percent range you can see all of those colored dots and circles and and the green triangles um are completely below one indicating law of reduced risk in contrast uh significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so if you look at the percentile so anything higher than the 75th percentile which translated into having an rdw greater than 131 percent was associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering the aging data and the all-cause mortality data for rdw that suggests that lower is better and then we can change that black arrow for rdw to red when considering that calorie intake a higher calorie intake is associated with a higher rdw so that's going in the wrong direction hence the red arrow all right so what about platelets so again the platelets reference range and again using lab chord state lab course theta is 150 to 450 times 10 to the ninth platelets per liter so platelets decline during aging which is what we can see here so starting from 20 years old going all the way up to 100 years old we can see that people younger than 60 have platelet levels that are around 235 or less whereas people older than 70 all the way up to 100 years old have played platelets about 210 so there's an age-related decline for platelets what about all cost mortality risk so as you can see in the title two to 200 to 300 platelets is associated with a maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk so when 200 300 is used as the referent we can see that there is significantly increased risk both for lower values of platelets less than 200 and also higher values of platelets so 300 and above so when considering the aging data and and the all-cause mortality data it doesn't tell us though within the 200 to 300 range is lower or higher optimal for platelets and then knowing that will help determine if the correlation for calorie intake with platelets is going in the right or wrong direction and i raised that issue because here's my platelet data in scatter plot form not just in the correlation form and we can see that over the past six and a half years in 30 blood tests that most of my data is in that 200 to 300 range with the exception of four blood tests out of the 30. But and the aging data suggests that higher you know so somewhere closer at 230 or 235 is better for platelets when compared with the lower values to 10. So if i just follow the aging data i i it may be a right guess or a wrong guess so how can we get some more specificity in terms of where should platelets be in that 200 300 range in terms of optimal health so one way we can do that is by looking at correlations for platelets with the big picture biomarkers so in contrast with looking at correlations for diet with the big picture biomarkers we can also look at correlations for biomarkers versus other biomarkers and that can provide more insight so here we have correlations for platelets with the big picture biomarkers now there are there are at least a couple of scenarios that can happen here in the first scenario platelets are significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than the right direction this would suggest that lower platelets in that 200 to 300 range in my case may be optimal and then in another scenario platelets would be significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than the wrong direction which would suggest that higher platelets in that 200 to 300 range may be optimal so what's significant there were seven significant correlations for platelets with these big picture biomarkers so now the we want to know is the is are the correlations for platelets with these seven biomarkers are there more going in the right direction than the wrong direction in order to assess if the correlation for calorie intake with platelets is going in the right direction or not so three of these are relatively easy to explain i just presented the data for ldl i'm sorry for vldl so that's we have a significant positive correlation meaning higher platelets is correlated with higher vldl we know that lower vldl is optimal based on the aging and all-cause mortality data so this is clearly going in the wrong direction and hence the red arrow similarly for the lymphocyte percentage and monocytes i've presented that data in another video and if you missed that it'll be in the right corner but the percentage of lymphocytes declines during aging and monocytes increase during aging and based on their correlation with platelets these are also going in the wrong direction so so far three out of these seven significant significant correlations for platelets are going in the wrong direction so if one more of these correlations are going in the wrong direction then we can conclude that having relatively higher platelets in my range may be not optimal for health and we should aim for the lower end of the platelet range so what about the correlation for platelets with bun is that going in the right direction or the wrong direction so once again the blood urea nitrogen bun reference range is 6 to 24 milligrams per deciliter and again if you're only using the reference ranges that doesn't tell you if it should be low in the middle or at the high end of the range so let's take a look at the aging and all-cause mortality data so first in the aging data when we're looking at blood urea nitrogen on the y-axis plotted against age all the way up to 100 years we can see that the data for men in green and in women in purple we can see that both of those groups have significantly increased or they have increases for blood urea nitrogen during aging from values of around 11 for women and 13 for men that increase past 20 for women in 90 year olds and above and approaching 24 in people older men older than 90. So the aging data suggests that lower for bun is better what about the all-cause mortality data so that we can in the all-cause mortality data for blood urinary nitrogen which is what what we're looking at here it's a u-shaped curve which means that the lowest all-cause mortality risk was present at about 16 milligrams per deciliter and then to the left so lower values and then higher values are both significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when starting with the aging data for men in other words starting at a blade your nitrogen blood urea nitrogen of 13 milligrams per deciliter we can see that it then increases the higher levels of blood uh nitrogen are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and when considering that the platelets higher platelets are correlated significantly correlated with higher bun that suggests that the coral that correlation is going in the wrong direction um so somewhere in the 13 to 16 milligrams per deciliter range for bun may be optimal but we don't want to go too low but we also don't want to go higher than that so if platelets are associated with higher bond that's again going in the wrong direction and now we can put a red arrow there now don't think i've forgotten about the liver enzymes ast and alt and red blood cells and i'm actually going to use a similar approach so those biomarkers comparing them against other biomarkers and the published literature and the story may not be how you expect in terms of following the published literature versus my own data biomarker versus biomarkers in order to determine is lower in the middle or high optimal for health but that'll be in another video stay tuned for that so to return to our original question in terms of calorie intake and what's optimal for health a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with four biomarkers going in the wrong direction and none going in the right direction so then again how many calories may be optimal for me so to address that we need to take a look at my calorie intake over this six and a half plus year period so that's what we're looking at here with average daily calorie intake on the y-axis plotted against time and note that each dot is the average daily calorie intake that corresponds to one of these blood tests so my average calorie intake during this period is about 2 600 calories per day with values as low as about 2240 down there but then also i've had calorie intakes as high as about 28 20 right there now when considering that calorie intake has a net negative correlation with these big picture biomarkers this suggests that i should aim for a calorie intake that is below my average value if calorie intake was associated with the same amount of biomarkers going in the right in the wrong direction i'd stay with my average intake and if it was associated with more biomarkers going the right direction than the wrong i'd actually shoot for a higher than my average intake so since the net effect is negative i'm going to shoot for a calorie intake that's below my average intake and for this blood test that's coming up in about a week and a half i've been averaging a little bit less than 2 400 calories per day all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging come check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
