Attempting to optimize the oral microbiome part 3. In part two the goal was to reduce salivary levels of tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum so the question is why so both of these bacteria can impact the health and or function of conditions not only in the mouth but outside the mouth and one of those is alzheimer's disease and as we can see with the list of bacteria that have been linked with alzheimer's disease both tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum have been linked with alzheimer's disease now also note that on this list is p gingivalis and that bacterium will make an appearance later in the video so then the next question is how how would i reduce levels of these bacteria so i've been using a homemade mouthwash as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome and is a quick side note a prebiotic is a substance that stimulates the growth of already existing bacteria and if you're interested in the contents of that mouthwash i'll link to parts one and two of this video in the right corner now i've been using the mouthwash three to five times per day with the goal of optimizing my salivary microbiome so for test number three i added clove oil to the mouthwash but i also used another oil summer savory oil which is which has been shown to impact levels of these bacteria too and i'll link to that paper in the video's description below so then there are several questions that arise did it work what was the impact on the rest of the salivary microbiome and then how will i further attempt or how will i attempt to further improve the saliva salivary microbiome and as we'll see there may be a role for berberine and to quantify these salivary microbiome i then used bristle now if you're interested in measuring your own salivary microbiome with bristle i have a discount link and that link will be in the video's description now on to the first question which was word levels of these two bacteria reduced so that's what we can see here with levels of tannerella forsythia infusive bacterium nucleatum on the left and then we've got the relative abundance so the percentage of these bacteria and all of the microbes that were in my salivary microbiome first for test number one test number two and then for test number three so first we can see that there was no tannerella forsythia detected in test number three which is good news but then fusobacterium nucleatum got worse with values of one percent point seven percent on test one and two and then it increased to 2.2 percent of all of the microbes in my saliva for test number three so from this we can see that there are mixed results for these levels of these two bacteria and is that the impact of clove oil being in the mouthwash or is this just normal variation so then that also raises the next question should i keep or remove clove oil from the mouthwash so for more perspective let's take a look at the rest of the salivary microbiome and its composition so first word levels of nitrate reducing bacteria increased and the reason i say increased is because 9 nitrate has been shown at least in in an in vitro study to act as a potential prebiotic for the oral microbiome and actually in that study it didn't just increase levels of nitrate consuming bacteria it reduced levels of potentially pathogenic salivary bacteria so here we can see levels of nitrate reducing bacteria in my sample and they or in my samples and they belong to two main bacterial genera niceria and rothia so for test number one without any nitrate in the mouth in the mouthwash we can see that these nitrate reducing bacteria were 53 about 53 percent of all of my bacteria in my salivary microbiome and then for test number two with the goal of increasing that further increasing that above 53 i added four grams per liter of potassium nitrate but unexpectedly we saw that my levels of nitrate reducing bacteria went down to 46 percent so then for test number three i cut the nitrate composition in half or the content in half to two grams per liter and still nonetheless levels of nitrate reducing bacteria actually went down further to 35.5 percent of all of the microbes in myself in my saliva so word levels of nitrate reducing bacteria increase they were not and note that the highest levels of these bacteria were present when there was no kno3 or no potassium nitrate in my mouthwash so with that in mind for the next test i'm going to remove potassium nitrate from the prebiotic mouthwash that i'm using you that i've been using for a while now why would why would increasing the nitrate content of the of the mouthwash not increase nitrate reducing bacteria so i'm already on a high nitrate diet and if you missed those videos i'll link to them in the right corner so levels of my oral nitrate reducing bacteria may already be saturated such that if i add more to a prebiotic mouthwash where i don't rinse after you know brushing my teeth and then gargling and spitting but not rinsing it out they may already be saturated such that i can't increase them further and maybe even if i do try to increase them further with more nitrate in the mouthwash as shown in my data maybe i'll actually increase them by some or decrease them sorry by some unknown mechanism so then what was the impact of clove oil on the rest of the salivary microbiome and there are several questions inherent in that question first were levels of oral health related bacteria increase and these are mostly the non-nitrate reducing bacteria but then also were levels of tooth decay halitosis and gum inflammation related bacteria reduced so first were levels of oral health related related bacteria increased and that's what we can see here this is bristle's definition of quote-unquote beneficial bacteria and this is mostly from non-nitrate reducing bacteria with the exception of nasaria mucosa so the second species on this list so for the for the first two tests i was at about 21 of all of my microbes in my saliva were from these seven bacterial species from these seven beneficial bacteria and then for test number three it was still in that ballpark 19.8 of all the microbes in my saliva so now we can answer that question with a note so they were definitely not increased with the addition of clove oil in the mouthwash now as a quick note i have room for improvement with these four streptococcus species uh and we'll see more on that a bit later so from these two bits of data from the nitrate reducers and the beneficial bacteria we can see that the addition of potassium nitrate for the two tests and or clove oil for test number three to the prebiotic mouthwash did not increase in my case nitrate reducing or levels of other oral health related bacteria all right so what about these reds the tooth decay halitosis no which means bad breath or gum and or gum inflammation related bacteria how were they impacted by the presence of clove oil so first looking at levels of tooth decay related bacteria and i don't want to spend too much time because i want to get into the berberine story i think that's the most interesting part of this of today's video so in terms of tooth decay related bacteria for the first two tests i had relatively low levels of these three bacteria that have been linked with two tooth decay 0.3 percent zero and then for test number three went back up to point three percent but that's still relatively low which is which is good news all right what about levels of bad breath related bacteria or halitosis and there are a lot of bacteria that have been linked with halitosis as shown here on this list now for the first two tests i had in the five to six percent range but then we can see for test number three that it got even worse it went up to 9.4 percent so then now we've got a uh that they the levels of halitosis related bacteria didn't get better they got worse so which bacteria are the most significant contributors because i have no interest in having any bad bad breath related bacteria in my saliva so uh in order to get rid of them first i need to know which ones are the most significant contributors to the total so it's definitely not tannerella for scifi at least for this test as as we can see with the green arrow they were reduced to zero and whether zero percent whether that's because of clove oil or natural variation uh we don't know but the majority is coming from two fusobacterium species not just fusobacterium nucleatum but a second fusobacterium periodontal periodontic sorry it's a hard one to say periodontico and we can see 5.8 percent of the 9.4 percent is coming from just those two fusobacterium species but then also we've got the poor and this is another hard one to say so bear with me porphyromonas endodontalis and p gingivalis which contribute another 2.7 percent so we can see that from these four bacterial species 8.5 percent of the 9.4 percent uh for halitosis related bacteria are just coming from four species so if i can get rid of these fusive bacterium and these uh porphyromanus wow it's such a hard one to say i may improve my salivary microbial time at least that's part of the goal and we can see that story similarly in levels of gum inflammation related bacteria as shown here so for the first two tests they were relatively lower 3.8 percent 1.8 percent but then they went up to 4.9 percent so this is also going in the wrong direction and once again we can see levels of fusobacterium and porphyromonas popping up uh fusive bacterium nucleatum uh poor firamonus endodontalis and gingivalis contributing all of the 4.9 percent just from these three bacterial species so with that in mind for the next test the primary goal is to reduce levels of bacteria that are coming from these bacterial genera fusobacterium and poor firomonas so how can i do that so berberine this is where the story comes in for berberine berberine may be a promising approach now note that there are no randomized controlled trials that have tested berberine as uh and its potential impact on the salivary microbiome this is from an in vitro study and and uh the reason for that is there are very few rcts unfortunately in people who have a relatively healthy uh salivary microbiomes most of them if if they do exist you know they're in people who have advanced gum disease or or periodontitis so there's a paucity of data in this field so i have to go to the in vitro data to see what may work in my case so what we're looking at here is the relative abundance of bacteria in saliva and in this case the saliva was from 20 people 10 men and 10 women that were in the 30 to 57 year old range and then the controls had uh p gingivalis was added to the saliva so they spiked saliva on the left with p gingivalis now this didn't didn't just impact levels of p gingivalis in the original saliva it changed the composition of the whole salivary microbiome so first starting with uh porphyromonas in green as shown there we can see that relatively low levels in the original saliva went up a lot in the controls that it was spiked with pigeons of us now this shouldn't be a surprise if you add sugar to water you're going to have a higher level of sugar in your samples but what is somewhat what is somewhat surprising is that it changed the composition of the salivary microbiome for example when looking at fusobacterium in yellow which were relatively low in the original saliva now we can see an expansion of fusobacterium and the controls that were spiked with p gingivalis which is not fusobacterium they didn't spike it with fusobacterium but then also note that streptococcus which i introduced earlier which were about 20 percent in these controls or in the original saliva we can see that they were reduced by about half in samples that were spiked saliva samples that were spiked with p gingivalis so in terms of changing the composition of the salivary microbiome we can see that spiking the saliva with p gingivalis didn't just increase its parent genera porphyromonas but it also increased fusive bacterium while decreasing streptococcus so what does this have to do with berberine how does berberine or does berberine impact levels of these of these three bacterial genera and that's we can see here so bc stands for berberine chloride and the last three columns the 15 30 and 60 are low medium and high concentrations of adding berberine to the p gingivalis spike saliva and first we can see that it had a big impact on reducing levels of poor firemonas as you can see the green now has gone back down to where it was in the original saliva but yet these were samples that were spiked with p gingivalis but in the presence of berberine pigeon devalis clearly isn't able to grow now a second change is on fusobacterium in the presence of berberine although in the lowest concentration of berberine at 15 micrograms per ml you can see that their yellow is still relatively high compared to the controls at the highest content of adding berberine to the p gingivalis bikes lab we can see that on the right it's almost completely absent so adding berberine also almost completely eliminated levels of fusobacterium which is also good news and then the last bit of good news is that we can see an expansion of the streptococcus such that the highest level of berberine bc that was added to the pigeon of alice bike saliva we can see that that streptococcus the blue bar went up a lot even higher than where was when it first started in the original saliva so note that each of these bacterial genera can be improved in my salivary microbiome so before concluding that this is the best of news these are the genus level data we need to know if these species that berberine can impact overlap with my bacterial species and then if they do that may indicate a potential positive role for berberine on my salivary microbiome so within which species with within each of these bacterial genera were impacted by berberine and that's what we can see here so first we're starting with poor firemanus gingivalis and then each of the two fusobacterium nucleatum fusobacterium species nucleatum and periodonticum so just going through this data and it's going to be a similar story to what i just showed uh on the previous slide starting with saliva that did not did not have pigeons of alice in it and when comparing it with the controls which did we can see that there was that big expansion of each of these bacterial species when compared with the original saliva that was not spiked with p gingivalis so what was the impact of adding berberine and then we can see the three different concentrations 15 30 and 60 micrograms per ml and when looking at the highest dose of berberine we can see that levels of these three bacteria even though they were added to syllabus samples that were spiked with pigeon javalis the the sum 1.7 so you can see 1.2.5 the sum of these three bacteria is now 1.7 in the highest dose of berberine which is almost identical to the amounts that were just in saliva but note that these samples were spiked with peach and javale so this is good news it seems that it seems that berberine can reduce levels of these three bacterium especially these bacterium are relatively high in my salivary microbiome so what was the impact of burberry on streptococcus species and here are four that were presented in this paper that have direct relevance to me as i also have data on them so first just looking at the sum of these four uh streptococcus species in the untreated syllabus it was 17 and a half percent when spiking the saliva samples with pigeon davaos it went down to 6.6 percent and then after adding berberine it started to go back up as the berberine content of saliva increase such that the highest dose of berberine increased streptococcus levels to even hire them where they were in the untreated saliva of 17.5 versus 31.8 percent now as i mentioned earlier my streptococcus levels have room for improvement too and here are levels of my streptococcus the same force streptococcus species for the first three tests so for my data i've been in the 12 to 16 range in terms of the relative abundance of all the microbes in my saliva now more specifically i have room for improvement with streptococcus salivarius as shown there in the study and then also in mine so i should note that i can't have zero even though it says zero for test number one because in order for that to become 0.2 percent of all my microbes in test number two there has to be a non-zero level where it can grow enough to 0.2 if it was truly zero i would have zeros across the board it wouldn't be able to grow at all because this isn't something you're just you know going to get from food or in the air so for test number four when considering berberine's positive effects on uh quote-unquote bad bacteria in my sample the poor fire bonus infuser bacterium but then also potentially beneficial bacteria i'm going to add berberine chloride and i should say i've already added it i've had it in my mouthwash for about a week now and i've added it a little bit higher than what was in this study um about 100 milligrams per liter which is also equal to 100 micrograms per milliliter and that's my my scale the limit of detection on my scale is 0.1 0.1 grams which is 100 milligrams so i can't really go lower than that so it's a little bit higher than the dose used in the in vitro study i'm also going to remove potassium nitrate from the homemade mouthwash as we see as we saw it didn't increase it didn't further increase nitrate reducing bacteria in my sample i'm gonna also take out clove oil because that clearly didn't improve my salivary microbiome and then last but not least i've started supplementation with streptococcus salivarius as an oral prebiotic and i started that two days ago so i don't plan on taking that for long i just want to seed it enough so that if berberine can affect affect positively affect my salivary microbiome it's there thereby enabling it to grow a lot further a lot higher than where it was at 0.2 percent so then will it work that's the big question and uh stay tuned for that in a future video if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of those discount links that i mentioned and merch so first discount links for oral microbiome composition as i mentioned with bristle epigenetic testing at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in that that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
