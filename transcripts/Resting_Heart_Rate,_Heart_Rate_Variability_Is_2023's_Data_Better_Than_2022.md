## Transcript

With the goal of longevity a major premise of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible resting heart rate and heart rate variability provide info about the heart but also the nervous system and adrenal gland and that's what we can see here so the resting heart rate and heart rate variability are cardiac specific measures but their levels are affected by the balance between sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves in more specifically the vagas nerve but also resting heart rate and heart rate variability are affected by sympathetic nerve activation of the adrenal gland which secretes nor epinephrine and epinephrine which also affects resting heart rate and heart rate variability in this video we'll cover what's optimal for resling heart rate and heart rate variability and more specifically how do these metrics rhr and hrv change during aging and also i now have close to 1,900 days of data so what's my v what's my data for resting heart rate and heart rate variability so first let's start off with how does the resting heart rate change during aging and that's what we'll see here so on the y- ais we've got the average resting heart rate in beats per minute and on the x we've got age and note that the age range is from 20 to about 50 years and these data are generated by whoop that's what i've worn since 2018 i'm not here to say who's the best but that's just what i've worned and there with when looking at data for females in red and males in blue we can see that the resting heart rate increases for both men and women up to 5050 years what about older than 50 years old some insight for that comes from the data for women and we can see that there starts to there's there's the beginning of a decline from 45 to 50 for the women so is that true does resting heart rate decline after 50 years old so for that we'll have to go to fitbit data which is shown here note that the paper will be in the video's description on the y-axis we've got the average resting heart rate plotted against age but now we've we've got the age range from 20 to 85 years old and in agreement with the whoop data we can see that there is indeed an age related increase for the resting heart rate up until about 50 years old after which resting heart rate declines so note that relatively low resting heart rates are found in both young and old which raises the question is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging that's where heart rate variability comes in as that provides more context so first how does heart rate variability change during aging and that's what we'll see here so on the y- axis we've got the rmssd that's the root mean squared of successive differences that's the hrv metric that whoop calculates and on the x-axis we've got age from 20 to 60 years old and then note that there are two different lines so solid and dashed the solid lines are data for hrv at 6:00 in the morning and the dashed are for hrv at 6 at night regardless of which of those are used we can see that hrv declines during aging now we can return to our initial question of is a relatively low resing heart rate indicative of youth or aging when considering the age related decline for heart rate variability so in youth we'd expect to see a relatively low resting heart rate and a relatively high heart rate variability so at younger ages a low resting heart rate at a and a high heart rate variability is what we'd expect to see at older ages we could see a low resting heart rate but a low heart rate variability is also what would be expected and if you're interested in older than 60 heart rate variability continues to decline i covered that in an earlier video and i'll put it in the right corner for those who missed it so at advanced age we'd expect to see a low resting heart rate or we could see a low resting heart rate but also a low heart rate variability now i'm almost 51 i'll be 51 in a few months so based on my current chronological age the expected based on this plot would be 35 milliseconds so with that in mind is my first 9 months q1 to to q3 of 2023 data for heart rate varability and resting heart rate is that improved year ofe versus 2022 and even where i from where i started in 2018 as the goal is to resist age related changes for as long as possible so first we'll take a look at the average yearly resting heart rate and these data start from august of 2018 through the end of september so the that's the end of q3 2023 and as i mentioned i have almost 1,900 days of data which is what we can see here so when i first started tracking in 2018 my average resting heart rate was 50.9 beats per minute and then over the next few years i've been able to sequentially reduced it and if you're interested in those changes i covered them in earlier videos i'll also put some of those in the right corner so what about 2023 data thus far through the first 9 months we can see that my average wrestling heart rate is 43.3 beats per minute now rather than looking at yearly averages we can compare these data using a two sample t test and when i do that and compare it with 2022 vers 2023 we can see that i've significantly reduced a resting heart rate in 2023 as that p value is less than 0.05 similarly when compared with 2018 data vers 20 2023 that too is a sign significant reduction 43.3 beats per minute ver 50.9 but remember is a low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so for that we'll go back to the plot and the good news is that i've avoided the age related increase as that's what's expected up until about 50 years but when considering that the resting heart rate declines after 50 and i just simply experiencing an age related resling heart rate decline so for more context let's have a look at hrv over this same time period and that's what we can see here so when i first started tracking hrv it was 47.3 milliseconds and note that i've been active my whole life this isn't i wasn't exercising and then i started exercising that was my data based on an active lifestyle starting in 2018 and then with the most for the most part with the exception of 2021 i've been able to improve hrv each year and if you missed some some of that story i'll link to those videos in the right corner thus far in 2023 my average heart rate variability is 65.4 millisecs and when using a two sample t test vers 2022 we can see that that's significantly better year-over-year and it significantly improved when compared with where i started in 2018 so we can see i've significantly increased hrv year-over-year and when compared with 2018 which is when i started and just to highlight that's a 38% increase for heart rate variability since 2018 so this idea that heart rate variability is an individual metric and that it's hard to improve it it's just not true at least in my case so now we can return that to that initial question of is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging and in my case a relatively high heart rate variability combined with the low resting heart rate of 43 beats per minute on average in 2023 would be relatively youthful that's in comparison to what's expected based on my chronological age which is a lower heart rate variability and a higher resting heart rate 30 5 for heart heart rate variability and 57 for the resting heart rate respectively so what's contributing to improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability in 2023 and i'll cover that in the next video coming on sunday so stay tuned for that all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging including daily data for resting heart rate heart rate variability and a whole bunch of other stuff check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics and a quantification epigenetic and teir testing or microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with scifox health and note that they include apob so it's a different panel than the atome metabolomics dieet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also have merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
