Levine's biological age calculator also known as phenotypic age isn't the only biological age calculator that can be used so today i'm going to talk about quantifying biological age with aging.ai so first let's have a look at some data so what we're looking at is the uh data from my latest uh uh from my latest blood test on december 29th 2020 just a few weeks ago and based on the data for the nine clinical biomarkers and my chronological age of 47 the biological age calculator phenotypic age gives me a value of 33.8 years now that's pretty good because it's 13 years younger than my chronological age which i've boxed there now by age is included chronological age is included in the phenotypic age measurement of biological age so uh because of that it it it allows for greater correlation with these nine biomarkers with chronological age now that's great because we want to have a calculator that is uh as close to perfectly linearly correlated with chronological age as possible so that it can be the most accurate now there but there's a limitation to that story uh so first by including age chronological age in the calculation the maximal biological age reduction is up to about 20 years so with my chronological age of 47 uh the the most that uh the greatest reduction that i could potentially experience would be seeing a biological age or a phenotypic age of around 27. Now taking this further let's assume that my uh biomarker data doesn't change for one full year but chronological age increases by one year now using this calculator uh my biological age then increases as shown here uh to 34.7 so one chronological year passes and my biological age goes up by 0.9 years but this in this situation my biomarker data is exactly the same as the year before so to me this seems like a problem you know if uh if my biomarker data is the same but i age one year in chronological age it doesn't make sense that my biological age should increase so uh taking this even further if i'm 80 years old and all of my biomarkers are indicative of youth am i really 60 years old at best or younger so although including chronological age in the calculation for the biological age calculator is important for getting as close as possible to being linearly perfect almost perfectly linearly correlated with chronological age it also may have a limitation in that it doesn't allow for uh greater than 20-year reductions in biological age so with that in mind are there other biological age calculators that don't include chronological ages available and i should say i'm still a big fan of levine's phenotypic age calculator i'm still going to continue to use it i just think it's important to use a variety of tools so that we can get closest to the to the actual picture so uh aging.ii is is one such tool and it's strongly correlated with biological age without including chronological age in its model so you can find it at aging.ai and it's free to use you just enter your blood test data and it'll give you a readout of your biological age so what is what doesn't include it includes 19 input parameters that are found on the standard chemistry panel in complete blood count cbc and these are tests that are commonly performed usually at a yearly physical with your with your doctor with your uh general practitioner uh and their cost is relatively cheap at about 35 uh in the u.s uh also note that c reactive protein is not included in on this list which is kind of an extra measurement uh when you go to the doctor uh so thereby you know potentially it's an easier measurement to just get the standard chem panel and cbc so how do the uh 19 blood biomarkers correlate with chronological age and that's without age chronological age being in the calculation so it's pretty strong with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 now for comparison note that that's not as strong as the levine's phenotypic age calculator which in uh for the combination of the nine clinical biomarkers in that biological age calculator and chronological age so the sum of those ten were almost perfectly linearly correlated with chronological asian two different studies and hence three with a correlation of zero point nine four and in haynes four zero point nine six now for a quick comparison uh uh with the best epigenetic clock for uh its correlation with chronological age that would be steve horvath's epigenetic clock from 2013 which has a correlation coefficient of 0.97 with chronological age so levine's uh biological age calculator is almost identical to that um and although uh aging.ai is not as good again it doesn't include age so uh it offers a slightly different perspective on biological age while still being strongly correlated with chronological age so having a relatively youthful biological age is important but is it actually associated would having a younger biological age actually be associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes uh and that's true for the venus phenotypic gate so a younger biological age in that situation a lower risk of death for all all causes so how about for aging.ai and in fact that is what they found so people that had younger biological ages then they're chronological uh that was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so uh so far so good in terms of a relatively strong correlation with chronological age and having a younger biological age being associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes all right so i have data for nine blood tests for levine's biological age calculator starting in 2018 that's just when i started including crc reactive protein for all my blood test measurements but i have data for aging.ai for 24 blood tests since 2009 that can be used to calculate biological age so let's have a look at that data so uh starting around 2005 i was only measuring about once a year just at a yearly physical and then recording whatever data they gave me with blood tests in an excel file now in some cases from 2005 i have all 19 variables but in many other cases i don't because i honestly i was just going by what they told me to measure i wasn't asking for measurements uh or certain blood test measurements so i on the left we can see that i tested i have a full set of 19 uh blood biomarkers uh in 2009 2012 and 2013 and i've included all the data on up on the list in case anyone wants to double check my uh my numbers you know go to aging.ai put my numbers in you'll see these these are the results that i've posted here so uh three blood tests over that four year span 2009 to 2013 and we can see my chronological age on the left my aging.ai 3.0 uh there they have a couple other versions that that require more than 19 biomarkers um that i don't have the full uh spectrum in many of the cases so that's why i'm using agent agent 3.0 all right so my aging.ai biological age in the middle and then my average biological age of those three measurements on the right so we can see that my average biological age is 32 years old compared with my chronological age over that period which is around 39 so around a seven year reduction for my biological age compared to my chronological age so that's not terrible it's go it's in the right direction but as as many who have watched my videos for uh using levine's phenotypic age calculator i'm on average 12 years younger than my biological age for my blood test data since uh 2018 so all this although this is good the seven year reduction for these you know 2009 to 2013 data uh it's it's not as good as uh i i can do so let's take a look at that data so in 2015 i started tracking my diet including weighing all of my food uh entering that data into an online free online software uh without plugging their name because i'm not sponsored um and any of them will work you know fitbit uh or sorry myfitnesspal chronometer all any of those will work for logging your nutritional info um so then i recorded all of that data including macro and micronutrients into an excel file so again since 2015 i have more than 2000 days of dietary data in an excel file uh and then in 2016 i started blood testing more often so instead of once a year my yearly physical with my doctor you know up to six times a year uh to get to to get a more full picture of my my biochemical changes during through throughout uh throughout aging so uh first let's take a look at my data from 2016 to 2017. So i measured twice in 2016 and then four times in 2017 and then we can see my chronological age my biological age in the middle and then my average biological age on the far right so in 2016 we can see that based on those two measurements my average biological age was 28 and uh compared with my average chronological age of 44 that's about a 15-year reduction now that's a big improvement too from the 2009 to 2013 data and i i can say that i you know uh i i didn't record my data my dietary data before 2015 so i can't give exact details about what i did differently uh but uh i'd argue that the act of tracking and then intervening once i got my blood test data to try to improve my biomarkers is a part of uh this ability this big jump in from seven years to fifteen year improvement in a reduction in biological age all right so let's go forward what about 2018 to 2020 so uh i blood tested far more often than in 2016 and 2017 first six times in 2018 and we can see that my average uh biological age over that period was 29 and a half compared with my chronological age that was now a 15.7 year reduction so going the right direction and even further reductions in biological age year to year biological age all right so 2019 over three measurements my average biological age was 30.3 compared with my chronological now i am 16.3 years younger so still you know uh for at least a four year period i'm able to consistently be 15 to 16 years younger than my biological age all right and then what about 2020 so we can see my average biological age over six measurements is 31.3 and when compared with the uh my chronological age over that period again i'm 16 years younger than my chronological age so um i do have some room for improvement uh it isn't perfect you know uh if you notice my glucose levels uh something like the last eight measurements are over 90 and uh you know i'd like to see levels somewhere around 80 to 85 more consistently um eight my hdl is somewhere around 44 on average over all the blood tests over the last uh uh since 2016. So i'd like to get it somewhere in the mid 50s if you've missed my hdl video i've got all the details about why the mid 50s may be optimal um so there is room for improvement now not only can with by tracking biological age not only can we track the how much it's reduced relative to the chronological by having many data points over a period of years we can track rate of aging so if we compare that data starting from 2016 and looking at my 2020 data so with an average biological age of 28 in 2016 and then 31.3 in 2020 that's a three year 3.3 years of biological aging in 4.8 years now i actually think i can do better than that too especially if i'm able to reduce my glucose levels without cha and improve my hdl levels without changing anything else now that's easier said than done so stay tuned for that progress uh in in my upcoming videos so uh let's play forward what if i'm able to maintain this rate of aging 3.3 years of biological aging for every 4.8 years that pass over the next 75 years so when added to my current chronological age 75 plus i'm i'm gonna be 48 uh next week so that'll put me at 123 years which would get me to breaking the the longevity record for uh you know men 122. So if i'm able to maintain this aging rate for the next 75 years how would that translate into biological age uh and based on the 3.3 divided by 4.8 that rate would translate into 52 years of biological aging over the next 75 years which would put me at about 83 years old biologically at 123 years now whether or not that that's how it's going to play out let's see um but uh let's hope that i can do that so i can break you know break the longevity record all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thank you and i hope you enjoy the video and have a great day
