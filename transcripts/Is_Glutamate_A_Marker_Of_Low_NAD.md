# Is Glutamate A Marker Of Low NAD?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Let's start off today's video by taking a look at plasma metabolites that are associated with future risk for all cause mortality and that's what we can see here so putting up a line at a hazard ratio of zero to the right of that line would be metabolites associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality in other words higher levels of the metabolite are associated with a higher risk and to the left of that line would be higher levels of metabolites that are associated with a reduced or decreased risk for all cause mortality so let's go through a few examples to the far right the metabolite that was associated with highest risk in terms of all-cause mortality is cotinine or cotinine however you might say it this is a marker of tobacco use and it's elevated in smokers also in the higher risk group is methionine sulfoxide which i covered in an earlier video as a marker of oxidative stress and last but not least as i don't want to go through all of these metabolites just a few examples is the amino acid glutamate so relatively higher levels of glutamate or associated within increased all-cause mortality risk so the question is why as we'll see in a minute high levels of glutamate could be a marker of low nad all right let's take a look at metabolites that are associated with reduced risk so first at the far left that the metabolites that's associated with maximally reduced risk for all-cause mortality at least in this study is beta-carotene which is abundant in carrots and greens also ergothian which is found in mushrooms but that could be a gut microbiome story and i may have more on that in a future video and then last but not least again i don't want to go through them all just a few examples the amino acid histidine so higher levels of histidine are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so what's the importance of histamine is there a connection between histidine and glutamate so let's get into that story so here we can see the citric acid cycle or tca cycle and then what i'd like to point out is during aging there is likely a block at isocitrate dehydrogenase otherwise known as idh and that's because metabolites that are upstream of idh including isocitrate cis aconitate and citrate increase during aging and that's what we can see here so on the left we've got levels and these are relative levels so this was an untargeted metabolomic analysis so the actual values more quantified it's a relative expression so on the left we've got levels of these three metabolites in 67 year olds 97 year olds the fold change comparing the two groups and then whether the differences were statistically significant using the p-value and fdr or false discovery rate so having values p-value and fdr less than 0.05 would be a statistically significant association so for citrate aconitate and isocitrate we can see that they're each higher in the 97 year olds plasma levels when compared with the 67 year olds and in terms of full change 39 to 49 higher in the 97 year olds when compared with the younger group and these differences were statistically significant so that's the first line of evidence that there may be a block in the isocitrate dehydrogenase but the question is why well notice that to convert isocitrate into two oxyglutarate otherwise known as alpha-ketoglutarate you need nad the age-related decline for nad is well known so if you don't have enough nad the efficiency of the reaction to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate may be poor leading to an accumulation of isocitrate and some of its upstream metabolites like a connotate and citrate so is an age-related nad decline impacting these metabolites so let's take a little a look at a little bit more evidence in support of that hypothesis so for that let's go outside of the tca cycle just by a bit and take a look at pyruvate levels which increase also increase during aging and that's what we can see here so looking at data first for the 97 year olds 1.12 versus the 67 year olds 0.99 13 higher levels of circulating levels of pyruvate in the 97 year olds and significantly higher so okay why is pyruvate higher why does it increase during aging well note that to convert pyruvate into acetyl-coa you need pyruvate dehydrogenase and guess what's a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase nad so if nad levels are low the efficiency of the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-coa will be suboptimal or poor potentially leading to an accumulation of pyruvate during aging so that's the second line of evidence that may indicate low nad by use by taking a look at these metabolites or plasma levels of these metabolites now fortunately things like the amino acid glutamate can help or at least try to help get around a potential age-related block for isocitrate dehydrogenase and that's because glutamate can be converted into two oxoglutarate and if that's the case we bypass that block at isocitrate dehydrogenase the citric acid cycle continues and that happens with this reaction here so glutamic acid otherwise known as glutamate is converted with the action of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase into alpha-ketoglutarate again also known as two oxoglutarate but again note what we need for this reaction to happen as a required cofactor nad so if any d is low we'd expect an accumulation of glutamate during aging and that's exactly what we see so glutamate levels in the 97 year olds 1.08 and the 67 year olds 0.98 9 higher in the 97 year olds and significantly higher so now we've got three lines of evidence that suggest low nad using metabolite data so agglutamate levels increase during aging as i just showed so what does this have to do with histamine well there are four amino acids that can be converted into glutamate to try to help get around this potential age-related block in the tca cycle and maybe there are multiple blocks but there's at least one and those four amino acids are arch arginine gln or glutamine pro or pro proline and hiss or histidine histidine levels decline during aging and that's we can see here so starting with the 97 year olds 0.93 1.02 and the 67 year olds nine percent lower in the oldest group and significantly lower so why would that be the case well if histidine is if nad levels are relatively low there may be an increased degradation of histidine into glutamate to try to get around that age-related block because of the low nad levels conversely if nad levels are high we'd expect to see high histidine which as i just showed was also associated with the reduction for all cause mortality risk so high nad potentially high histidine because you wouldn't need to convert it into glutamate to try to get around an age-related block because of low nad so with that in mind low histidine could be a marker of not only low nad but also tca cycle dysfunction now we don't have to sit idly by we can track and potentially optimize levels of these metabolites during aging and that's with using metabolo's at-home metabolomics kit and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me use this kit for many uh metabolites already i won't go through them all but if you're interested in any of these metabolites in terms of age-related changes and what may be optimal just do a search on the channel and they will come up now this kit is a gold mine of information it includes more than 500 metabolites i still have two more videos planned for acyl carnitines that's a marker of mitochondrial function and kidney function biomarkers so if you're interested in using the kit discount link in the video's description so as i mentioned we can track and optimize at least three of the metabolites that i showed histidine glutamate anaconditate with iolo's kit so i i currently have data for two tests in april and in may of 2023 and i have data for the third test that i'm waiting on more on that in a minute so first looking at histamine you can see that they're relatively close 76 and a half and around 79 micromolar so that's good test to test variability is low and my diet is remarkably consistent so that's what i would expect i would expect minimal changes for some of these metabolites as the diet is pretty consistent from test to test now remember for histidine the goal is to avoid an age-related decrease so far so good but there's more to the story so stay tuned in a second similarly for glutamate in the same ballpark 128 versus 119 micromolar and then for a connotate again also relatively close values test over test now for the other three metabolites citrate isocitrate and pyruvate they're not yet in this kit but i've been informed by a by io load that they should be coming later this year now for the five metabolites that are not histidine the goal is to avoid an age-related increase which potentially could be indicative of low nad now if i increase nad will these metabolites then move towards youthful levels and that would uh probably you know directly address that hypothesis that low nad is contributing to levels of these metabolites in blood now for my third io test which again i sent in late july my nad levels i also sent nad for analysis on that day was too full about two-fold higher than my baseline my baseline is about 25 micromolar without any supplements for that test it was about 59 micromolar as i was supplementing with niacin and tryptophan so nad was higher did levels of these metabolite chain metabolites that may be affected by nad levels did they change so stay tuned for that video as soon as i get it from iola i'm going to obviously put it in a video and show it to everyone all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing also telomere testing using true true diet sorry true diagnostic or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyfox health and note that their panel is almost exclusively different from iolo including apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or dietary brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
