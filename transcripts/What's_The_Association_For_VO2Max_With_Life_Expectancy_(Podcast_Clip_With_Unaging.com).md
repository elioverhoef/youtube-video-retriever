So what's been making the the rounds lately is uh the idea that we want to have v2 max as high as possible and there's almost this skew of you know we need to be elite endurance athletes to maximize our longevity and that's in part because of uh not to name jop but peter aa and peter is basically referencing this paper and this paper will be in the video's description um so if you're interested uh check it out and what they did here was they compared uh six groups of uh fitness levels from least fit to extremely fit they quantified it by mets we can be translated into v2 max so the extremely fit group had a v2 max of around 51 whereas the least fit was uh 17 so that's our range 17 least fit to 51 extremely fit and then when looking at mortality risk which is shown here all cause mortality risk when using the extremely fit group again v2 max of 51 and comparing that against all the other groups people that had that v2 max in the least fit of 17 uh had a four-fold higher uh risk of death for all causes so the least fit four-fold higher risk of death for all causes so that that's the uh the idea that's been circulating that you know we need to have a v2 max as high as possible but i haven't seen peter mention any numbers so it's important to put that into context because because as you mentioned your pre-marathon training was 53 or 55 55 55 and this is without i mean what kind of training volume running wise per week well i'm i'm only doing uh a half an hour uh actually two half hour runs per week but i've been doing it consistently for um three or five years um so i think i'm pretty maxed out actually as far as my v2 max goes although i did gain even more once i bumped it up to marathon level training yeah but the point there is we don't need four hours or six hours i mean you're doing it from an hour and you've got a v2 max 50 so i think that's an important point because like i said the the the the data the meme that's perpetuating on social media is that we've got to be elite endurance athletes and from your data one hour in conjunction with all the o all the other weight training and everything else you're doing um v2 max over 50 you're in the extremely fit group so the the other thing too here is to to point out the extremely fit group vo2 max of 51 when compared with the high fit group which had a vo2 max of 42 and i should say from my own experience i measured v2 max same thing face mask the whole thing a real v2 max test not this uh you know estimated stuff based on resting heart rate which is not reliable or not nowhere near as close to reliable i mean there are you know people online who are like my my apple watch says my res heart rate is this my predicted v2 max is 60 and and and i'm like dude you're 60 years old there's no way there's just no way so um so when comparing so i from my own experience three v2 maxs in the lab uh from 2012 to 2017 or 2018 i was in the low 40s each time now that's with my regular workouts my full body 90minut workout plus walking it was 15 to 20 miles per week no running at all so you don't have to be an elite endurance athlete to be in the quote-unquote high category for v2 max now is my v2 max the same since then i have measured i can't say um but at worst i'd imagine i'm in the fit group but i i' who knows i'd have to measure it the the the the interesting factor here is that v2 max is milliliters of oxygen consumed per kg body weight so i'm 20 pounds lighter or or 15 pounds lighter than i was then reducing the denominator so assuming my maximum ability to consume oxygen hasn't changed or even if it has changed with a lower cardio training volume i'm not walking 15 to 20 miles a week anymore on purpose um i find it hard to believe it would be dramatically different but all right nonetheless comparing the 51 v2 max versus the 40 42 you can see that even having high fitness 39% increased risk of death relative to the highest fit group okay so that's big news i mean that's basically saying you want to have your v2 max above 50 relative to the 40s right and to put that into further perspective you know people who had uh ckd chronic kidney disease 49% increased risk of death so you know being highfit is almost as bad as having ckd relative to someone who's uh extremely fit with vo2 max of 51 so so this is very pretty pretty astounding data right but there is some devil in the details and uh this brings us to the mortality risk across fitness categories according to age groups so this study included a very wide age range um from 30 year olds all the way up to 90 year olds and you can see the sample sizes for each they're very large sample sizes which is great news and then comparing at each each age group getting all the way up to 80 to 95 years from least fit to extremely fit and now the reference is defined as the people who were the least fit v2 max of about 17 so again once again within every group if your v2 max was what was it 51 around 51 in the extremely f group you had an 84% chance lower risk of all cause mortality for 30 to 49 year olds 78% 80% 66% 73% reduced relative to the least fit group but where the details start to become uh you know uh interesting at least for me is when you look at the highly fit group and see the extremely fit group okay now it's only a 10% difference in terms of lower risk now granted 10% is still a big deal i don't want to throw away any uh association for reducing mortality risk but this idea that the 40s versus the 50s in v2 max is this dramatic reduction maybe as bad as ckd or other smoking it's kind of overblown i mean here for 50 to 59 year olds there's only a six% difference for the v2 max of 42 versus the the 51 8% for the 60 to 69 year olds 133% and okay 15% but where this the story gets a bit more interesting is you know when considering that the 50 group um has a the lowest all cause mortality risk at every age range and is even better than the than the high fit group in terms of all all cause mortality risk then the expectation is well you must live to 115 years you must get or 120 you must get to the maximum lifespan your v2 max is 50 you're going to get to the max lifespan what's your life expectancy if you have a v2 max of greater than 50 so they looked at that and here it was men with peak exercise capacity of 10 to 12 mets that's a v2 max of 35 to 43 so this is not actually looking at the uh the greater than 50 so the fit and the highly fit they only live five four and a half years longer compared to the lowest fit the people who had a vo2 max of 17 i mean that's a fiveyear increase in average life expectancy and those with the extremely fit higher than uh 51 v2 max had a six-year this isn't a 25 5 year this is going from 73 to you know 79 years right so one thing i'm always talking about is how can we do better than the eat real food and exercise approach a vo2 max f50 is great but if you're telling me i'm only going to expect to live to 80 that's just not good enough can we tight trate the exercise dose can we look at biomarkers of overtraining can we look at blood biomarkers to make sure our liver as you saw isn't chronically you know damaged or muscle damage all right so what about for the women so the story is about the same in this case the um the 10 to 11 and a half mets so that's a vo2 max of 35 to 40 they lived only two and a half years longer than the lowest fit group which is outrageous i mean their v2 max is double and you know if we only go by you want to have a v2 max as high as possible i mean that's only a two and a half year longer life expectancy and i'm not trying to diminish that it's important i just want to add context to what's already out there and then for the highest for the highest fit group just to finish it off real quick um for the highest fit group it was about seven years but again this is going from a life expectancy of 69 years in the lowest fit to 76 again not 95 not 115 um so right so i i i agree with your point and i think that as you brought up the one of the more important things to look at is that this is divided by your body mass your your weight so this isn't one indicator of how your lung capacity is or your mitochondria is because as soon as you divide it by the weight that can overwhelm things if you're on the heavy side then even if your lung uh performance is above average if your weight is greater than that you're not going to be in the elite in the other elite despite the fact that you're could be quite uh have quite a good cardiorespiratory system so um in some ways feel like this is uh they talk about it being as fit as possible but in some ways i feel what they're really saying is that it's important to keep a low bmi overall so that's an interesting point because i should have brought up uh the the uh demographics the subject demographics in the paper and it was the average the average bmi within groups within each age group was overweight or obese what that means is a bmi of 25 to 30 is considered overweight and actually if i remember correctly the bmi for each group was closer to 28 29 30 in each age group so these were overweight people and then in some cases it was uh an average bmi of 30 or more which is clinically defined as obese so but what that says is for this paper is if you are overweight or obese and can attain a v2 max of greater than 50 you will still have the lowest risk of all cause mortality but their models were adjusted for age sex bmi um but what you're raising is the more interesting point of what if your bmi was lean and you have the bmi the the the v2 max greater than 50 what's the life expectancy gain there and i didn't see that as a subset i wish they did but now that population is unfortunately probably very small we're talking a very very small group in terms of maybe hundreds not 20 or 30,000 if they had in each of these age groups so just to finish off too with the people who are older than 70 with a cardiorespiratory fitness greater than seven mets which is a v2 max of 25 uh they only lived about 3 years longer compared to the lowest fit group so again you know this idea of of uh you know granted the i goal is to be as fit as possible not just you know strength and mobility balance but also v2 max this is only a two a three-year gain in life expectancy you know they lived to 87 years on average versus 85 years so um so i think it's important to frame the context of you know what what peter's putting out there uh you know that v2 max is an important component but i think we we need more specific markers uh it isn't just you know eat real food and exercise get good sleep it's how can we you know get the exercise prescription and get the dietary prescription and um you know look at biomarkers of organ and systemic function to really push us beyond these 87 and 95 year um you know caps for life expectancy in studies i mean i' i'd add to that uh play the long game on this when you're going for longevity um it's easy to if you're trying to maximize v2 or your v2 max right now this month unless you have a race coming up or like a marathon it it you can take your time on it and over time even if you're starting at a standard level if you're continuing to practice it on a weekly basis eventually you will find yourself in the extremely fit group is sort of uh time takes its toll and you're able to reduce the normal loss as you just age from in a sedentary fashion so what do you think about i agree 100% um i i have a couple factors too what do you think about the exercise dose that maximizes not just v2 max but general fitness while also attempting to optimize heart rate variability and resting heart rate in other words high hrv low resting heart rate you know looking for that dose that maximizes all three where i think most people are only focused on how high can i get my v2 max and if my heart rate variability and resting heart rate looks overtrained and aged relative to my chronological age who cares right so what do you think about that combination as an exercise prescription so i i keep it uh minimal i'm always trying to get the most benefit for the the least amount of effort so um my aerobic exercise um despite being quite fit i'm very consistent so i virtually never miss miss even a week of exercising but just the the um two half an hour sessions of doing running um i find enough to keep the vo2 max as long as it's on a really consistent basis um if you take like a month off then all of a sudden then the low the low um the low dose doesn't work because it will take you too long to catch back up to where you were and then if you lose another month then now you're basically you're almost untrained um a study that i looked at that did vo2 max training had basically a a 12-week wash out period um to basically return the person their cardiorespiratory fitness b back to baseline as if they had never done any exercise at all so um it even before three months uh or 12 weeks of resting even if you're taking like two or three weeks i think that if you're combining it with a low regular dosage is going to be a problem but if you're able to be consistent in it then you can use that to optimize both your hrv and uh high and your heart resting heart rate low by only doing a little bit of exercise each week i actually find that on my exercise days because it's half an hour i know that your routines are usually more on an hour or so if i remember correctly 90 90 minutes there you go an hour and a half so i don't even notice an impact on my hrv or resting heart rate the day after i do those exercises in fact those are some my better days because are combined with my fasting and other things so um i think the key to to to working all those dials is to find a very efficient uh thing and then do the get the most benefit out of doing the least effort on it and then be consistent about it yeah
