# Oral Microbiome Tests #8 and 9: Serratia marcescens Is Still A Problem

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

I have a big problem in my oro microbiome and that involves the bacterium seraia maresin or sadia for sure sadia has been linked with many adverse health human conditions including pneumonia sepsis menitis and so on down the list now i currently have seven oral microbiome tests and sadia has been fortunately zero on two of those tests but as we can see it has has been far from zero on the other five 40% 41 % for one of the tests but you can see for the other four at least 88% and as high as 96% in other words almost all of my oral bacteria all all of my oral microbiome is completely dominated by seraia for at least five of these seven tests so for test number eight the plan was to potentially decrease sadia by following correlations with diet but then also could i increase levels of bacteria that are inversely correlated with sadia by also following correlation with diet and there were eight bacteria that fell into that category and if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner as i described this process in full detail so for the abridge version for this video i'm basically addressing the question is there a diet or a microbiome axis so for the foods that were significantly correlated with those nine bacterium we can see the ones that had the greatest overlap with the almost majority of those nine bacterium here so they included mushrooms yogurt onion and protein now the foods that are colorcoded in red would suggest that i eat towards the lower end of my range my intake range for these seven tests as higher levels were significantly correlated with either lower levels of the inverse sadia bacteria or higher levels of sadia so i want to eat towards the lower end of my range to follow that correlation conversely for yogurt that was significally correlated with five of the nine bacterium and going in the right direction so either lower sadium or higher levels of the inversely correlated with sadia bacteria so then the question is did i follow the correlation so i took the 30-day average prior to this test uh or test number eight and then we can see that for mushrooms uh my average intake during those 30 days was 209 g so that's towards the lower end of my range which is following the correlation as i mentioned the red data indicates i want to eat towards the lower end of my range to follow the correlation for yogurt it was 144 gr per day but note that for the last 20 days before the test it was exactly 150 g so i'm following that correlation too and then for onions and protein we can see that my intake was towards the lower end of the range thereby following the correlation so i followed correlations for these four foods as they had the majority of the overlap for these nine bacterium either directly impacting seria or other bacteria that could potentially crowd out sadia so did it work unfortunately not for test number eight that i took in sep september of 2023 seria levels were 96% again it's completely dominating my oral microbiome there's almost nothing else in my oral microbiome besides this one bacterium with this one bacterium that's associated with a whole bunch of adverse human health related conditions so what will i what did i do for test number nine so i noticed that on the two days that i had zero it dietary intake for a couple of things were different than the other five tests so could i impact sadia levels by by uh following uh correlations for foods that were on the days where i had zero versus the non-zero days and for a food that popped up was cardamom the spice cardamom which was 2 grams per day on the two days where i had zero sadia but it was only2 gram per day on average for the other five tests now i don't i don't know and i didn't know if this experiment would work and it may seem like i'm pulling it straws just trying to throw anything and see what'll stick but sometimes that's how how it goes so did it work so i tried two gram of cardamom for 3 days including two days before the test and two grams on the day or the morning of the test a few hours before but that didn't work either we can see that seratti levels were 95% for the test in october of 2023 so we can see through through 10 tests sera maresin is still a problem in my oral microbiome so what's the plan for test number 10 so to address that let's take a step back and take a look at all all nine tests to see if maybe there's some pattern in that data for what i did or what i could potentially do for test number 10 that may work and note that these data are generated by bristle and if you want to measure your own oral microbiome composition there'll be a discount link in the videoos description so for the first five tests in addition to toothbrushing and string string flossing daily i used a homemade mouthwash which included 1% xylitol 1% sodium bicarbonate so sorry sodium bicarbonate and a few drops of peppermint oil and that was in one liter of water so i used that for the first two tests exclusively and for one test you can see seratti was 88% for the second it was zero which would potentially argue against this mouthwash this homemade mouthwash which i used uh three to five times per day so after meals and then just randomly throughout the day so that i had zero on one day and 88% on the other argues against the potential rule for this mouthwash doing anything i mean how can it be very high and then zero it suggests that something else may be a play but let's see how the story plays out maybe that's not the case so for test number three to this mouthwash i added four gram per liter of potassium nitrate as nitrate has been shown to act as a prebiotic for the ora microbiome basically feeding some of the quote unquote good good guys while crowding out some of the quote unquote bad guys now i'm already on a high nitrate containing diet and i detailed this fully in earlier videos if you missed the oral microbiome playlist i put that whole playlist in the right corner so 4 g of pottassium nitrate added to this mouthwash you can see 41% sadia so still not 95% on the right track so then for the test number four i reduced the pottassium nitrate concentration in the mouthwash to 2 gam per liter and also added a few drops of clove oil so to the initial homemade mouthwash solution xylitol sodium bicarbonate peppermint oil was also potassium nitrate and clove oil and here we can see test number four zero sadia so maybe that this mouthwash did have something to do with potentially reducing sadia i don't know yet for test number five back to 95 or up to 95% this was the base formulation of the mouthwash xylitol sodium bicarbonate peppermint oil but then i also added berberine which clearly didn't do anything and then for test number six i didn't use this mouthwash at all because i didn't have any data without it so i wanted to see what would happen no mouth wash at all just using water after meals as a mouthwash and then randomly swishing water throughout the day in addition to toothbrushing and uh string flossing daily but i did include also uh water pick and tongue scraping but we can see that combination didn't do anything to sadia at n as it stated 95% for this test for test number seven i did use a version of the homemade mouthwash but this time 5% xylitol as there's a published inv vitro study showing that high concentrations of xylitol especially 5% or higher can reduce seraia levels by about 80% and so but there is no bicarbonate or peppermint oil in that mouthwash so same system three to five three to five times per day but that didn't impact saria either it was at 96% following i don't remember the exact amount of days but again i detailed how long i did that for in an earlier video for test number eight again no homemade mouthwash but i file the correlations with diet which we just saw didn't work and for test number nine it was was the cardamom day of the diet uh experiment which also didn't work so when comparing the first five days of data with an average of about 45% sadia versus the last four tests which about have an average of about 95 a. Half% clearly there may be something to the the having some formulation of that mouthwash in the in the everyday approach and when using a two sample t test they are indeed significantly different with the first five tests being significantly lower than the last four tests so with that in mind for test number 10 i'm going to return to the original formulation of the homemade mouthwash xyl sodium bicarbonate and peppermint oil i can't say if i'll go how many more tests with just that formulation to collect enough data but i'm considering adding in a couple grams of pottassium nitrate to see what they may what that may do to the uh seraia levels so stay tuned for that in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for oral microbiome composition epigenetic and tmia testing ned quantification atome metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health including apob green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or di trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the videoos descript thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
