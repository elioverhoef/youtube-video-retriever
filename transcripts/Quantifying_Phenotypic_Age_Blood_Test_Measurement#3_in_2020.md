# Quantifying Phenotypic Age: Blood Test Measurement#3 in 2020

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

What's up everybody today i'm going to talk about quantifying phenotypic age posted a video earlier on phenotypic age which is also known as a biological age it's a measure of disease risk and risk of death for all causes so let's have a look at my data so a couple days ago i got the standard blood chemistry screen screen also known as the cbc and c-reactive protein measured and that's basically all you need to calculate your biological age so what we can see is i had high levels of albumin which are found in biological youth so that's good news higher than expected creatinine bad news higher than expected glucose also bad news the trend continues higher than average c-reactive protein stellar levels of lymphocyte percentage pretty good mean red blood cell volume and red cell distribution with biological youth values for alkaline phosphatase and higher than average my average values for white blood cells my average is about four and a half somewhere in that range so with a collection of those variables results in a phenotypic age of about 34 years which isn't bad considering that my chronological age is 47 so i'm about 13 years younger than my chronological age so one blood test is nice but i've also as as the slide shows i've also measured my phenotypic age two other times during years so we can get a more complete picture of my aging processes with more data so compared to my march measurement my phenotypic age was significantly younger about two two and a third years younger than in june and i also met measured in february which was a little bit worse than the march measurement but also better than the june measurement @ 32.7 five years so i just want to highlight that you know one blood test is nice but from my experience and i've have about 25 blood test measurements over the past five years six times a year is important for seeing your own trends in the data and what i mean by that is every february in that range january february mid-february i get some kind of respiratory infection up until this year it was likely influenza i thought i had corona virus yet exactly pretty close to exactly this time in february the antibody test though came up negative so i didn't have it so i had a cough and no fever but nonetheless that increased my white blood cells to higher than average values for me as i mentioned earlier around 4.5 is is my average for white blood cells thereby resulting in in what i thought was a higher than expected phenotypic gauge now once i recovered from that a month later as expected the white blood cells came down and my blood test variables improved enough to reduce my phenotypic gauge by a little more than a year now in going to the june measurement i didn't have a respiratory infection but patel potentially worse and i say that with all respect to people who do have crohn's virus but for me every year in june and july i'm afflicted with hay fever and this is a you know brought on by bouts of sneezing and stuffy nose you know red itchy eyes it's awful and again i don't want to diminish coronavirus people who have that this i'll i'll survive a hay fever but in terms of my biological agent it doesn't it clearly doesn't positively impact it and just to highlight by c-reactive protein which was 0.53 milligrams per liter in this measurement in june it's usually about half that in measurements that are not in june and we'll see that data in a couple more slides so if i only measured in you know say march i would miss the june trends and because i'm measuring every june we're almost every june i should be able to come up with better strategies whether it's dietary or other strategies to improve my phenotypic age going forward because i'm tracking it okay so based on these three blood tests so far in 2020 my average phenotypic age is thirty two point seven eight which again is 14 plus years younger than my chronological age not that what about 2019 date so although i said i have 25 blood tests results for the past over the past five years i've only included crp since about one once in 2018 and twice and 2019 all my blood test measurements going forward are going to include crse reactive protein so i should be able to measure you know phenotypic age in every blood test going forward so in september and late october of last year i measured twice in september my phenotypic gauge was about 35 and a half and then i improved that in october to about thirty one point three now that's a big drop how did i do it well i started cutting my calories up until september of last last year i was not calorie restricted at all my average calorie intake was somewhere in the 27 to 28 hundred range i track my calories every day with a food scale so that's pretty close to accurate so starting in september i then started cutting my calories and then not cut them by about two to three hundred a day i think my average was somewhere around 25 50 and that reduction was you know was able to reduce my phenotypic gauge significantly now you know this is 2019 versus 2020 on the previous slide but i don't have any data yet for the second half of this year whereas i didn't have any data for the first half of last year so you could make the argument that these these data these two data points in addition to my 2020 data are a full year of quantifying phenotypic or biological age and if if you compare them they're pretty similar the average my average phenotypic age in 2019 was 33 point for four years whereas this year so far as thirty two point seven eight so if you you know take the average of those values it's around 33 years still 14 years younger than my chronological age so what about 2018 so i mentioned that i did have measurement did have crp measured in 2018 and as i mentioned hay fever is is terrible for me and that's reflected you know biochemical you can see my c react 0.67 which again is about double my average value that does not include judah measurements so six non jun measurements versus two jun measurements the jun measurements i have double crp than i do the rest of the times during the year now the importance of that is further illustrated by you know the hay fever for me is pretty bad in june and early july and then it starts to fade which is ridiculous because it seems like it takes me two months to adapt to you know the grass and pollen in the air which is incredibly slow for a you know an immune talk to build immune tolerance nonetheless that's two months out of every year that i have approximately double the c-reactive protein levels that i have for the rest of the year now over sixty years that's one in six years or ten in sixty years that i would have double than normal than my normal inflammation so for ten of the next sixty years just based on my june and july crp data even though i didn't show july data i measured that yet but i'm assuming that my july crp data is elevated - based on my symptoms that's that's ten years out of sixty which is a significant amount of time so obviously i'm you know interested in doing whatever i can do to reduce my c-reactive protein during my periods of hay fever so that i can live you know with lower levels of inflammation during that period potentially further enhancing my you know my measures of health including phenotypic age so two years ago my phenotypic age based on my measurements my that my variables blood test variables thirty four and a half now if you remember 2019 it was less than that thirty three point four and thirty two point eight so one could make the argument that i've actually reduced my biological age by about a year and a half going from 2018 the other interesting measure measurement is that comparing june 2018 versus june 2020 so two full years have passed but yet i've been able to reduce my phenotypic age by half a year although two years of chronological age have passed so i'd say that i'm on the right track in terms of improving my year-over-year or you you know biannual june measurements and one component of that is reduced c-reactive protein but just as a last aside here i didn't go over in the earlier slides but they're all is not perfect here and there is room definite room for improvement as you can see my glucose levels here and the in my measurement earlier this week we're at 99 milligrams per deciliter and since 2018 i have you know a bunch of measurements that are in the 90s and that's going in the wrong direction i have a video showing data that values for blood glucose between eighty and ninety four milligrams per deciliter are associated with reduced all cause mortality risk and values closer to eighty are found in biological youth and they increase during aging so my glucose levels are going in the wrong direction similarly my creatinine levels have been consistently going towards one or higher which translates into a reduction in kidney function over the past two years or so so i'm not going to go into it in this video but in upcoming videos i'm going to look at associations between my diet with my creatinine and glucose levels and then make interventions to potentially reduce my glucose levels and and creatinine levels which should further reduce my phenotypic age so stay tuned for that for more info you can visit my website and if you've got questions or comments here are all the places that you can find me online that's all i've got have a great day
