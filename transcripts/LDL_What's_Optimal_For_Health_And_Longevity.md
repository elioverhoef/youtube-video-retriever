Ldl cholesterol what's optimal for health so in this paper from 2004 they proposed that the optimal low density optimal concentration for low density lipoprotein or ldl is 50 to 70 milligrams per deciliter so is this true well ldl increases during aging with values between 100 to 130 not 50 to 70 milligrams per deciliter found in youth so that data is here with data for uh men on the left and women on the right so uh in in terms of uh what ldl levels look like in youth we can see that for men 15 to 34 years old the average ldl uh was 120 milligrams per deciliter not 50 to 70. So what about for women so when looking at the data for women for 15 to 34 years old the average ldl is 108 milligrams per deciliter so in just looking at the aging data this idea that the optimal low density like protein range of 50 to 70 is inaccurate what about all-cause mortality risk so risk of death for all causes so uh first in looking at the kang buck samsung health uh health study and this was a study that included uh more than 347 000 uh non-statin users so people who are not on lipid lowering or ldl lowering uh medication and also subjects that had a history of cardiovascular disease cbd or diabetes were excluded from this analysis and that's important because if subjects were ill or had a disease that could potentially adversely affect their ldl or other variables and that would you know skew any subjects that had similar ldl variables that they would also look you know they'd be all they'd be grouped together because low ldl relatively healthy low ldl potentially sick so to account for that the authors of this study excluded the subjects that had cbd or diabetes when looking at the data so this is a study that had 199 000 subjects or 199 000 men and again on the y-axis we're looking at all-cost mortality risk plotted against the ldl concentration on the x-axis so uh what we can see is that uh lowest all-cause mortality risk was found for uh ldl between 100 to 129 milligrams per deciliter so what about higher risk so to find that we put the hazard ratio bar right at one and then uh places on on the chart where we see the dashed lines which is the 95 confidence interval which are either completely above or completely below the red line would be indicative of higher or lower risk so in this case we can see that higher risk is significantly higher risk compared to the 100 to 129 ldl at the lowest point uh well i should say highest risk first was a very close to highest risk was for ldl greater than 160 but that is right on the border what's clear is the low uh the higher risk for having a lower ldl and in this case ldl less than 70 milligrams per deciliter is associated with a significantly uh increase all cause mortality risk in men so what about in women so interestingly ldl was not associated with all-cause mortality risk in the 148 000 women in this study so when compared with the lowest risk which was again one 100 to 129 although there there were you know there seems to be a point uh in the in the curve where ldl less than 70 looks like it's uh at increased risk um and that's significant when adjusted for age but when they uh authors of this study adjusted uh you know in their fully adjusted uh um models uh ldl was no longer significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in women so having low ldl less than 70 uh in 40 year olds in this study in the 40 year olds of this study uh is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk what about older than 40 years old so uh that data we have here and this is the korean genome epic epidemiology study with subjects that had an average age of 53 years and uh what we can see first is when looking at the data for men and again they in this study they didn't include data for people that were taking ldl lowering or lipid lowering medication so they excluded people who were taking statins from their analysis so this is 63 000 uh men that were not taking statins so when compared to the reference of an ldl range of 100 to 129 milligrams per deciliter uh men that had lower levels first less than uh 70 to 99 and less than 70 had a significantly increased all-cost mortality risk so relative relatively similar data to the slide i showed uh previously so uh when looking at model 3 which is the fully adjusted model first when looking at ldl of 70 to 99 we can see that compared with 100 to 129 for ldl uh those subjects had a 37 percent higher risk for all cost mortality and then for this for the group of men that had ldl even lower less than 70 they had an 83 increase all-cause mortality risk when compared with the 100 to 129 groups so lower ldl in this study um in an older a little bit older group again not good for health so what about higher than uh 129 in men uh and in that case uh that data was not significantly different than uh when compared with the reference group 100 to 129 so from that you can conclude that having higher ldl may not be associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in the 53 year old men in this study so what about in women and again these were not uh statin users they were excluded from the analysis for also for the women so a large study almost 120 000 women in the study and again when compared with 100 to 129 were lower or higher levels of ldl associated with an increase all-cause mortality risk for women and interestingly similar to the data on the last slide ldl at this age at these levels were not was not associated with all-cause mortality risk so what about older than 53 years old with an average population age of 53. So i'm going to show data from the copenhagen general population study and this included 58 year old on average uh men and women so uh again this is data for subjects that were not taking uh uh statins so no they weren't taking any they didn't they weren't prescribed or taking any lipid lowering medications so this is a study that included dated included data for 40 about 42 000 men and we're looking at all cost mortality on the y-axis uh plotted against ldl cholesterol on the x and then also on the right side of the y-axis it's got the population density which is the thin blue line which is basically the you know the the population based average for the distribution of ldl and we can see that the average ldl is somewhere around 130. Now when looking at the all-cause mortality risk data we can see that lowest risk for all-cost mortality for this uh age group is around 140 milligrams per deciliter not 50 to 70 so higher again may be better so um what about increased risk so in this case we can see that there's an increased all-cause mortality risk for having ldl values less than 131 but then also greater than 189 so there's a sweet spot for ldl for this age group so what about women so unlike the earlier data in 40 uh and 53 year old women where ldl was not associated with an all-cause mortality risk now we start to see that there is a significant association so when compared with the lowest risk 143 an ldl of 143 was associated with lowest low cost mortality risk we see an increased risk for lower levels uh less than 92 but also uh greater than 189 so again there's a sweet spot for the ldl uh for potentially for an optimal range for minimizing uh all-cause mortality risk so uh can the increased all-cause mortality risk for low ldl be explained by reverse causation so just to briefly introduce that again so if if you have an illness and that illness then negatively impacts your circulating biomarkers uh and then you're you know you also have a group of people who do not have you know uh uh over illness and uh so they're gonna be grouped together so to to account for reverse causation you can uh do a few things to try to uh to try to identify you know is it the sick or is it the sick and diseased that are driving the data or is this an effect that's found in the general population that's free of disease so in in the study that i just showed they tried to account for reverse causation negatively impacting the data by removing subjects that didn't have data for within a five-year follow-up and what that means is basically that uh that would be the if they didn't have a five-year follow-up data or up to five years of follow-up it's possible that the majority of those subjects died um and that's why they didn't have additional follow-up data so by excluding the subjects that didn't have five-year follow-up data you're potentially accounting for uh reverse causation because you're eliminating that data uh from the start now inherent in the uh potential for people to die within that five-year follow-up are dying from individual diseases so they also uh excluded data for people that um were diagnosed with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for uh they excluded people that had cancer and then they excluded people that had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and then looked at the data and associate in association with all-cause mortality risk for each uh for if you know as ldl increased um okay so what did they find so first we're looking at uh the the first uh chart uh to the left uh so they removed people that didn't have five-year follow-up data when compared with the lowest risk for all-cause mortality which again was at 143 milligrams for decided for ldl once again we see low ldl is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk uh so what about after removing uh people that were diagnosed with atherosclerosis at baseline so in this case then again lowest all-cause mortality risk is for an ldl of 140 with increasing risk uh for low levels of ldl and also high levels of ldl as shown by the arrows what about excluding people diagnosed with cancer at the baseline study visit well in this case again ld an optimal uh ldl was around 143 lowest law cause mortality risk and then a higher all cosmetic risk was for values lower than 143. And then uh again uh excluding uh for uh copd patients that were diagnosed with copd at the baseline visit uh again having too low or too high above that 132 optimal ldl value was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so this is data in up to 58 years old can we go older what's the association for ldl with all-cause mortality risk in adults older than 58 so i'm going to show two studies first in 74 year olds and then in 94 year olds so first we're looking at data for about 70 000 uh subjects with an average age of 74 years and all-cause mortality is plotted on the y-axis against ldl cholesterol on the x and what we can see is decreasing all-cause mortality risk as the ldl is uh all the way up to values of ldl greater than one you know around 141 so we can see that there so when compared with the lower ldl in this case less than 100 subjects that had or 74 year olds that had greater than 140 or 141 had a lower all-cost mortality risk so once again this is data showing that having uh you know higher ldl but not super high is better than having lower ldl what about 94 year olds so this is data from uh 935 uh subjects that had an average age of 94 years and obviously the sample size is going to get much smaller as we get to uh subjects that are you know older the older than 90. Um so what we can see here and this is a survival uh survival curve we can see that the black line were was is the survival curve for people who had an ldl greater than 130 and the dashed line or the uh you know the the jagged line is had was people who had an ldl less than 130. So uh this is you know up to three and a half years of survival when compared to sorry this is a three and a half year survival after measuring ldl levels at the baseline visit so they are either higher than 130 or lower than 130. And what we can see is that uh that there was a better survival for the 94 year olds that had higher levels of ldl higher than 130 when compared with the uh survival of the people who had 94 year olds that had an ldl less than 130. So how high can we go here what are the ldl levels in even older subjects in centenarians is it 50 to 70 or is it higher like i've shown for all of the data through the various age groups so this is data in a thousand and two centenarians so uh older than a hundred years old and accordingly the average age of this cohort was 102 years old and their average ldl value uh that that's in millimoles per liter here but also i put the data for milligrams per deciliter average ldl 107. Not 50 to 70 as proposed in that paper from 2004 and that i've seen in many circles online uh you know postulating that this is the optimal ldl for health and longevity and minimizing disease risk so so what is optimal for ldl then well if you're healthy and what i mean by that is disease free haven't been diagnosed with a disease and not taking lipid lowering medication based on all the data i've shown here today somewhere in the 100 to 140 milligrams per deciliter range for ldl now if you are taking lipid lowering medication there is actually data that's different from what i presented here in terms of what's optimal for all cost mortality risk so if you're interested in checking that out just leave a comment and uh i'll post that paper all right that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
