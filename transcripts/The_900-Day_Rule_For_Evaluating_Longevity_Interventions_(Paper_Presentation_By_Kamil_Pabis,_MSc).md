# The 900-Day Rule For Evaluating Longevity Interventions (Paper Presentation By Kamil Pabis, MSc)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey everyone today's guest is camille pavis who's a grad student in brian kennedy's lab at the center for healthy longevity at the national university of singapore uh to uh today um cil is going to go through his recently published paper that identified a 900 day rule when looking at lifespan studies so if your controls don't live longer than 900 days uh what are we even looking at so with that welcome cile and uh let's get into the presentation all right thank you all right as just mentioned the idea is that lifespans of your control mice impact the interpretation of the research we're doing with mice and this is research that i recently published here at the center for healthy longevity in singapore i'm working in the brian kennedy lab and we also had a few other collaborators in this paper and it's actually cool maybe to give you sort of the background story how this whole thing came to be so 10 to 15 years ago i read ending aging by arbit de gray i started reading his call from michael ray right and he explained you know control m need to be really long lifted for studies to be solid and ever since then we both have been obsessing about how to run good mouse lives been studies and how people get away with publishing things and not being honest about the limitations which is an issue right and then i moved to singapore to finish my grad studies i noticed that recently met cabaline he started also posting online about this topic and i reached out if we could write together a manuscript an opinion piece on this so these were the beginnings and when we started writing um my colleague doo joined and he suggest that i already had the manuscript drafted he was like why not call it the 900 day rule and i thought wow this is perfect description i love it and so this is how how the paper came to be and let me click here i will walk you through the basic first because they're very important the paper is often misunderstood we will talk how long m should live and what can we do with this knowledge once we have like defined certain benchmarks and how can we design better mouse lifes spin studies and find good drugs to slow aging so maybe if we translate it in human terms it's easier to understand if you compare these three countries they will have different life expectancies so in nigeria it is rather low probably driven by poverty infectious disease premature mortality would you say that people in nigeria age faster than in the us this is very unlikely now in the us we have lifespans around 77 years this is still very low for developed nations and this is driven by drug related deaths the obesity epidemic so if you compare the us to singapore for example you see in singapore people are much healthier so they live much closer to the biological limit of humans and they're more likely to die from age related diseases and if you were to extend the lifespan of of a singaporean population this would be much more impressive and probably related to longevity but even here it's not perfect there is a very high salt consumption and you could perhaps slightly improve the lipin by just reducing premature mortality from cardiovascular disease so i think this is an interesting way of putting it in human terms and you can also think about it another way there are million millions of way ways to harm a mouse to kill it in in some sort of premature way but there's only one way for a mouse to be really really long lifted and that is by slowing aging and we see see this so this is more like a theoretical figure there is a sort of biological limit that is species in strain specific for lifespan and if you have really good husbandry then your survival curves change in shape and this cohort of animals or humans um tends to die closer to this species specific optimal median lifespan and often at this point the population starts dying really quickly so morbidity is also compressed and the survival curve is of a more rectangular shape as we say and this is not just theoretical we see see this in mice but i think it's most beautifully illustrated in human data so as child mortality decreased and you know other health interventions improved human survival curves became more rectangular and we're inching closer towards our sort of species specific maximum and we just thought the same should be true for mice given what we what we know about bioontology and only if you study these really long lived mice will you get solid results and this was the fortical side we also looked at real data so whenever you run experiments in multiple mouse cords you give them some sort of intervention or treatment it can be anything you will notice that the longer lif cohorts respond less well to the life's extension treatment usually almost always and for example this was pretty clear in this classical study published over 10 years ago where caloric restriction was imposed in this ils cross iss strain um so it was basically almost obvious from this initial public if you look at the raw data from this original paper and i thought since this was a very controversial paper i want to reanalyze it maybe we can learn something new so i looked at this data and i looked at other large caloric restriction experiments performed across various species so we have now these large experiments where are many strains of flies many strains of worms and yeast were exposed to caloric restriction and then researchers checked how they respond how their lifespan changes in response to caloric restriction and when you plotted the animals that were already long lived in the beginning you notice they respond much less to caloric restriction sometimes even caloric restriction is harmful in these whereas the um the you know the bottom survivors the the least fortunate members of those strains they respond the best to caloric restriction now this could be a counterargument that caloric restriction maybe won't work in really healthy species or humans but there is one problem that you could see the same pattern in the data for purely statistical reasons so this is something we wanted to correct for there's a really pervasive statistical artifact called called regression to the mean it affects literally any kind of study even control trials and i think it's very cool to explain it using free examples let's say you were to recruit people with depression for a controlled trial they will usually in the beginning present with higher than average depression scores and then they will converge towards some sort of median value because there was some depression cut off in your recruitment criteria so this induced regression to the me or if you throw coins and you throw a certain side four times in a row then the next four coin frows they will still have a 50/50 chance each but the average value of them will converge towards the mean expected value now the same is true if you were to look at multiple cords of mouse uh of mice with lifespans let's say they have the 900 day mean lifespan maybe for some reason you sampled 50 m that had an 80 800 day mean lipin just by chance now the next cord you will sample is more likely to be closer to the 900 days and this can induce a lot of interesting weird artifacts and without going into detail uh we try to adjust for it so this is one of those studies where lifespan is plotted on the x axis and the benefit um to caloric restriction is blooded on the y axis so these are those ilis m exposed to caloric restriction it seems like the longer lived animals respond less well but we wanted to correct for this uh regression to the mean artifact sort of assuming and put in the simplest terms that from the control group you can derive a sort of distribution and then pretend that we're treated with placebo and what would you expect in this synthetic experiment which is plotted here in blue and you see in the synthetic experiment you still get regression to the mean now the question for me i think is is the result that we see in those pink with those pink dots even more pronounced than the one that is expected based on purely regression to the mean and then the interpretation of this is that even adjusting for this statistical artifact these caloric restricted mice the longer lived ones responded less well to the intervention we also see this in flies and worms so there are two large experiments where we saw or the offers saw that caloric restriction taken in total does extend lifespan of multiple strains but again um the longer lift strains responded less well and here you can also briefly note that um the patterns of the regression to the mean look look different because if you have very large sample sizes you're less likely to encounter regression to the mean and for example this fly experiment shown at the at the top was run with very large group sizes the bottom experiment with very small group sizes so generally with small group sizes you get much more pronounced regression to the mean and this is always something that you have to account for in one way or another in these large multicohort studies and having established the last are important we ask like how long should the mouse live and then strictly speaking in the paper we mostly talk about black six m and head free the two most popular strains in currently in longevity and if you plot data from many many other studies different meter analysis you will notice that lif spin vary quite a lot but the most elite survivors they tend to top out around 900 days um in in that range for black six m and had three m so we thought the natural limit for black six m is around 900 days based on this however as was correctly pointed out by by colleagues of course this can be very strange specific so this conclusion may not hold for other strains so there are other very commonly used strains that are much shorter lift so in my opinion those strains might be less robust than black six m but there are actually even strains which are longer lif you're ally maybe they're even better models of aging than black six months however in the paper we really wanted to define a benchmark of how long should these black six and head free m live under the best circumstances and this is uh what we call the 900 day rule once you pull the data you see that in the best case they live around 900 days and from this we can then conclude if you run a study and you control mice do reach this lifespan then your results will be more robust but even failing this right if you got unlucky and your control mice are short lft maybe your intervention is still very robust and it leads to a lifespan much higher than 950 days this is still extremely unusual and this still suggests that your intervention is probably working and somehow beneficial so you compare to historical controls and some people wondered is maybe 900 days too high too stringent how do different labs perform i don't want to you know sing out anyone as a bad lab because uh that's not how it works um sometimes people get unlucky we cannot fully control mouse lifespans as i will explain in the second part of the talk but here i just want to plot data from some colleagues who consistently run like really amazing mouse lifes spin studies and you can see that they get like consistent lifes spin so lif spins are often very consistent within facilities and labs so um alan richardson we already discussed my colleague marco malol from italy for example the itp gets amazing lifespans for the female head free mice so it's possible let me say that and now that we know you know how how long do we think these m should live in the best case um can we apply this knowledge to rerank interventions and this is actually more important than people think because by now we have hundreds of potential intervention that have some efficacy but not all studies are created equal some of those studies are relatively weak because the lifespans are short and the controls and other issues and here we looked at free interventions so the liv plotted on the y axis the historical controls are on the left and we look at taray repam and metformin and for tas you can see that exposed mice have higher life spin for ramy as is known in the literature they also live longer and by our you know by our benchmark these m are longer lif than you would expect they they reach liv spin at the top end and far above the top end of what you would expect so this nicely fits with our 9900 day rule and then met forming we chose is a sort of negative control because recently people have shown that it just doesn't do anything in mice when you pull the data there is a nonsignificant tiny improvement in life spin but even if this was real the absolute life spin is so low and the controls are show so shortlived in those metformin studies that the data is just not robust however that does not mean that metformin cannot be healthy either in humans or mice so in theory there can be you know longevity extending or longevity norm normalizing interventions as we call them so longevity normalizing would be the ones that can work in a sort of unhealthy cohort that suffers from premature mortality they can help the cohort reach the natural lifespan could be for example statins and people with high lipidemia metformin and people who are slightly overweight i don't know something like that and longevity extending are like romy that really help you beat the biological limit of lifespan and we can go back for example to drug age and rearing compounds um look at the most promising of those so we did this and you see some you know classical things like depr which was in the '90s probably the best studied and most robust intervention before for the existence of r and e ga and maybe it's perhaps nicer to plot them the way we did it in the paper with absolute lifespan so how long do the m live when you expose them to all those different drugs and it's very interesting for example you can see that this ndga is towards the top so these m were were long lived in the drug age database and this drug was also some somewhat successful in the interventions testing program um which we think is related to the fact that it already worked in long lift mice so that it's that suggest it's a robust intervention interestingly neiv uh was in drug age it works in long lived m but while our article was in in press and in revision i think it failed in the itp so you can see that um you can never fully predict results just because it works in one long lift mouse trin doesn't mean it will work in another one and this is very cool the intervention testing program will test the pr in an ongoing cohort so we will see if this will be robust we would predict that it it should be a robust finding that can replicate in the interventions testing program because it used to work in other long lift straints you can also look at genetic interventions and rerank them to find the most promising things um so as is known uh we find that the best models tend to be those that have mutations in some sort of growth hormone signaling pathway but we also find that some of the top genetic mutants um use different mechanisms so there are the six overexpressing mice tas overexpressing mice so these are very cool alternative mechanisms that still yield very very long lifespans in the treated groups unusually long lifespans and i think these are very cool candidates to follow up so this is one thing you can do with the 900 day rule um i think these two f2 and fgf21 among the grove and nutrient signaling pathways are very interesting they are still quite understudied although they lead to really amazingly long lived mice when you knock out sorry knockout act two or overexpress fgf21 then what else can you do so one question that we were asked um you know is is the rule does it have predictive power does it does it work for other interventions so we looked at classical intervention rep m caloric restriction dwarfism and we basically checked how many studies where were this these interventions were studied past the 900 day rule and you can see that sort of for the positive controls a lot of the studies pass the 900 day rule but for metformin they basically don't and we generally show that you know the the robust interventions that we know at the gold standards they tend to work as you can see in this figure b in studies where the controls were already long lived and they further extend the lives spin of those long lift controls which suggests they're highly robust whereas something like metformin is not and i think it's very cool to look at the dwarf data plotted like that in absolute terms to see just how amazingly long live these animals are and in gray we always plot this historical control so the 900 day benchmark you can see that the dwarf m are so much longer lived and this is what we expect from a robust intervention that's how it should look when you start pulling data across different studies another thing to sort of validated 900 day rule is you can look at so i already mentioned the intervention testing program which is a large very robust very regor mouse lifespan testing program perhaps the best in the world and we always ask as researchers will will the compound replicate in the interventions testing program will it also work there and we can look at non-itp studies where success in those studies predicted success in the itp study and we see for components like nj or repy these worked in non-itp studies they passed the 900 day rule in in non itp studies and they also worked in itp studies where some other compounds aspirin nad boosters curine they were tested in the interventions testing program they failed but when they were tested in other mouse models they only extended life spin in short short lft animals so we do think that the rule is able on average to predict more robust compounds that will work in different different strains and to give a brief update this year was was amazing in terms of the 900 day rule there were three different papers published with approaches where the controls were very long lift and you got fertilized and extension so here's a figure from matt caline on the recent i 11 antagonist antibody um this one extends for example lifp spin in long lift against long lift controls the traa combination group and a certain polyphenol test that also works so i i have hope for the field that we're moving forward to getting a lot of robust studies and this is indeed what we observed in in the paper right if you plot um studies published over the last 100 years and the lifespans of control animals in those studies you see that there was a turning point around the 1980s studies the lipin started really improving before they were very quite low now we're getting closer to having 850 900 day lif spans in studies with a lot of variability we hope we can further improve this and this will make future studies more robust but there are certainly a lot of studies that already meet this benchmark and this is unpublished data just for you so so we actually see the same trend in rats so our red husbandry also improved and interestingly most rat strains also kind of top out around 900 a days so you can use this 9 out a day rule of fum also to look at red studies in general um now what are the implications how can we make lif spin studies even better it this is very important now of course it has been suggested that your m should be really healthy they should have a healthy weight maybe even induced mild calorie restriction in the control might have to keep be kept in a low stress environment they're very sensitive to smells they can even smell human hormones they can smell blood of adise so that's very important um people keep their mind in specific profion free facilities these days but i've actually found that certain labs can also get great lifes spent in non aspf facilities as long as they're clean and reasonable there are other tricks we have to work on stand standardization within and between facilities we have to make sure that our easia guidelines are reasonable so some people are concerned that veterinarians are starting to um euthanize mice too early when they showed the earlier signs of discomfort which if you ask me is ethically slightly questionable they need there needs to be a balance just because someone is pain doesn't mean they desire to be eaned so treat treatment should go before euphanasia so that mice can live as healthy and as long as possible so there are a lot of factors that can be optimized without going into details to improve m lif studies and i stated before there is a lot of unpredictability we don't have full control over how the lifespan studies goes we don't fully understand why the lifespan vary so much however once we editors readers realize that lifespans are important we can start rewarding success we can you know give certain advantages to papers that have simply better controls and then they naturally will be competition to publish papers with better control liv sp once we start paying attention to this and of course even if you have shortlived m this doesn't mean the data is worthless so different strains they offer genetic diversity uh this can be important testing in diverse strains even if there are slightly shorter lift and you know other factors also matter in designing a great study lifp of the controls are not the end all so to sum up to sum up what i said basically the n00 day rule is important we think the longer mice live the better and 900 days is a very good cut off for very healthy black six and head freise still it's a rule of fum it's not a super hard rule it gives you a strong intuition and i think it's a good intuition there are other ar cut offs if you look at it for example p values there is no reason why 0.05 is the border to significance there is nothing fundamentally different between 0.04 and 0.06 except the tiny difference it was just chosen for historical accident and also what i really love about um this 90 day rule is you can actually nicely translate it to humans if you look at around divide the the lifespan of those black six m by 10 in days that's the lifespan that humans are roughly reaching in years and i think our lifespan is also converging towards 90 years i think this is close to the biological limit that humans will reach without extending and extending our lifespan slowing aging and yeah all studies are important we should not you know not publish studies that fail the 900 day rules we don't want any publication bias we need to look at various various genetically diverse mice and now what are the next step for me or for the lab we want to raise awareness how to run good studies we want to develop these rules also for invertebrate studies because we think the same thing is happening there and then we want to identify promising interventions test them inver in invertebrates to see if they target perhaps evolutionary conserved mechanisms and then design new and better studies and yeah thanks for listening thanks to the team in singapore our funders n us by did you look at uh maximal lifespans using a similar approach not a 900 day rule but you know maybe 11 or 12200 days so maximum lifespans we did not look a lot at it for two reasons they are statistically harder to estimate as the sample sizes get lower when the m are older they are slightly less intuitive and we think when the m are healthy the median lipin is generally a good predictor of the maximum lip but i do agree in principle maximum lipin is a slightly better readout for slowing the rate of aging yeah even if it's not a readout for the rate of aging just seeing you know uh like you said just because you get that increase in median lifespan you would assume that there's an increase in maximum lifespan but in many studies that's not the case you know so it's the survival curves just b basically flatline off and everybody dies at that same point right so um yeah all right and then another factor too is sample size so did you have a sample size cut off because some studies you know that'll post uh even with short relatively shortlived controls they'll have initial sample sizes you know per group of like eight mice per group you know which independent of the of the you know maybe the controls are short live now you've got a eight verse eight survival study which i don't know how instructive that is when compared with some of the itp or other labs that are using you know 50 67 mice per group which has a greater power so did you exclude some studies or not based on initial sample size per group so we did not exclude studies based on sample size i looked at the data with and without correcting for sample sizes and so for example the median lifespans reported for black six mice i looked at the huge cohorts and some smaller studies and um they were clustering in a in a in a similar range but your right if the sample set is small you're much more likely to get outliers and that's not preferable you want to have like maybe 30 to 50 miles at least for single rigorous study but sometimes you know there are these experiments like this caloric restriction all the on the ils cross right so it's 40 cohort each cohort is very small but taken together it was a big experiment but that's what the office had to work with because of funding issues so yeah and then when the richardson group uh try to replicate uh the la you know the right they he wasn't their group richardson richardson's group wasn't able to replicate those findings i think in six of the eight strains that they tested um calor restriction still worked which was like so what are your thoughts on that disparity it's it's very complex so i looked at this and what definitely does not replicate between uh different el's studies is the magnitude of lives spin extension under caloric restriction but the control life spins they do replicate there is variability but we know that these do replicate and this is a lot of strange interesting conclusions but as you say allan richardson found a more positive positive interpretation but it's it's very amazing that the degree of calor restriction does not not fully replicate this is strain dependent right so it depends on the strain for calorie restriction in mice you know the the magnitude of the cr potentially impacting lifespan right so so so so some studies show better effects at 20% relative to 40% too much restriction maybe bad uh so did you factor that in for the cr studies or the cr was just any restriction not necessarily 10 20 all in one group so main analysis was on this initial ilis study where there was a fixed level of caloric restriction so all the m get the same restriction this is the only one that has really sufficiently large sample sizes to do um a forest statistical analysis on and when you start pulling data there are these meta analysis of caloric restriction studies it gets extremely hetrogeneous and it's much harder to draw conclusions so i i also saw a study that uh um they did cr fasting duration plus circadian alignment i don't know if you i don't think you i didn't see that in in the included list uh where um and i forgot i forgot the authors but you know so circadian alignment being that they fed the mice during uh night time not during the daytime and that actually extended lifespan more than cr plus fasting so i uh any thoughts on that and it if i remember correctly was the cr plus fasting was greater than cr in terms of the 900 day rule and circadian alignment was even better it was like 1,50 for so i didn't see that study included either so just maybe some nuance what do you think like it's not just pure cr but maybe getting the fasting window and other factors yeah this is quite a recent study and it's part of these uh studies trying to disag disaggregate the benefits of caloric restriction this is one and the other one is where it was shown that fasting is a partial the fasting window is a partial contributor to the benefits of caloric restriction but the calories itself are also an independent contributor and then there is also the alignment issue so all those three seem to affect m's lifespan so yeah this these three factors seem to play a role yeah additive relative to cr alone yeah so it seems so yeah so if you put that in the interventions that are that beat the 900 day rule right so just to recap cr tas rapy uh and the growth hormone knockouts right so um i wonder how that compares i mean that probably would put cr at a closer magnitude to the other studies that seem to be better in terms of more robust um median lifespan extension yes but i think so acc according to matt and i think this is true the study with the largest lifespan extension is still one of those old studies where they had like a very severe level of caloric restriction 50 around percent and no one so far has beaten the absolute lifespan of this cohort maybe one day using fasting and some sort of alignment and maybe something else we will beat it but so far we have not managed to beat this old study for some reason yeah all right and then uh diets across studies is not always the same so um i guess that wasn't a factor that was just you know what lifeband you have in the study that you're conducting um because if you're using a purified diet versus you know purified high fat diet versus standard chow you'll see differences in lifespan um so factor or not diet yeah i'm not sure if purified versus non-purified affects lifespan and also the macronutrient composition like people have studied it for 30 plus years and it does play a small role but so for example protein restriction has a much smaller impact than caloric restriction but certainly the macronutrient composition can play a role so you the control ipl could vary according to this somewhat but within you know within reasonable bounds when you pull the literature data it seems to often converge to 900 days so maybe some labs you know have found the magic formula which makes them even more longer lif maybe slightly slows the intrinsic rate of aging gotcha wait so now that opens up a whole can of worms right so protein restriction right so methine restriction um was that included in the analysis i don't remember seeing no and and those extreme single amino acid imbalances have massive impacts on lifespan but um so far for protein restriction in total it does not seem to work that well and the variation within regular roden cha is not huge but like the bca and protein theine restriction tend to have pretty substantially effects yes yeah so how would how would methionine restriction compare in that small group of interventions that consistently beat the 900 day rule i start i looked at this for a a while ago and there are actually not as many studies as i hoped but i think among all the amino acid restrictions it's the most robust one with the most studies backing it up but i can't recall where how many of those studies actually beat the n day rule gotcha and then in terms of uh you know the p purified diet not impacting lifespan or not extending it so there is uh at least one study where a keto diet so it was purified very high fat um and it extended lifespan but or median lifespan i don't remember in terms of the 900 day rule have to take a look but um it because high-fat diets will lead to it's obesogenic right so which can shorten lifespan so they had to feed the mice a specific amount of food in order to get that lifespan extension to make sure that they didn't overeat so i guess that that study that that keto extends lifespan study that wasn't uh included either or i'll have to go back i guess and take a look and see i don't recall the details but i know that i looked at all the keto studies in mice i think there is more than one now and i was not impressed by the lifes spin benefits either in terms of control lifes spin or or the size of the effect so compared to col restriction was not impressive at all so i didn't look much further it can have benefits under certain circumstances but it for life spin it was not super impressive i think it's important to highlight what has worked generally in the shorter lived models um but not in the not beating the 900 day rule which some of these supplements are very popular in the anti-aging you know uh circles like berberine alpha ketoglutarate as you mentioned metformin um so if if if you're getting an increase in lifespan in a shortlived strain could you argue that maybe when considering most of the at least american population is you know becoming more overweight and obese quote unquote unhealthy phenotype if for these uh uh molecules that are extending lifespan relative relatively shortlived strains right could you argue that the people that are on in an unhealthy phenotype could benefit the most from some of these supplements yeah i thing that's bloss possible and it's also the realm of medicine that's what they try to do they try to find a target population which is sick and then normalize their lifespan so that's what metformin can beautifully do in pre-diabetes right but then the question is yep for the buran and akg i mean i also thought a bit about this so i think we have still very few studies to say whether they really consistently failed the 900 day rule akg was going to be retested once again in the itp at an earlier onset so we will learn more about it but so far the data not very impressive and maybe they're like you know longevity normalizing helpful if you have some disease st yeah but in terms of so people who are generally healthy then so sticking to that small window well granted it's only basically two interven well uh i don't know that so there are some toras activators right i don't know that they're the same as what was used in the in the published studies but rapy and cr toras and then i don't know how you would you know redu i mean or interventions that would reduce growth hormone signaling right in people that would be the gold standard in terms of what quote unquote healthy people could potentially impact human longevity right i mean the list in our paper wasn't fully exhaustive i mean there are a lot of interesting interventions and the problem is if you look at all the weak interventions you end up with dozens 50 plus and then you're popping all those random pills based on really really really weak mouse studies and i think using the n and a day rule to draw a line and then combine it with human clinical data is the wise choice to pre-select your supplements so recently also not in the paper i think because it's a new paper i was somewhat positive about the tarin work because their dem mice were nicely long lifted so that would be perhaps over berberin i would choose tarin if i had to choose some you know based on preliminary data yeah but what about more specificity right so let's say you're in a quote unquote healthy bmi but you could be metabolically unhealthy right it's this uh you know uh skinny fat phenotype right so uh what do you think about using biomarkers and then you know a targeted approach for example you know uh circulating levels of glucose increased during aging um a carbos in that case would limit how much glucose would be absorbed potentially reducing circulating levels potentially impr improving metabolic health and lifp so in that case for someone who's metabolically quote unquote unhealthy and doesn't want to change their diet a carbos would have a specific role that also could potentially impact lifespan whereas most people are seeing the animal studies and they're like oh this extended lifespan like you said i'm going to take 50 pills but what do you think about using a biomarker driven approach even in the mice right so um the mice at an older age maybe have poor kidney function let's give them a supplement that improves kidney function and uh you know they have some fungal infection rapid ming could be beneficial in that case right so what do you think about using a biomarker driven approach in people to dictate which supplements even using some of the animal data right as instructive you know uh but what do you think about you could even imply that towards the mice where um you know identifying the short liv strains by based on biological age or epigenetics whatever it may be so how do you integrate biomarkers in this to have a more specific supplemental approach for optimizing life uh health and lifespan yeah i think you should absolutely this is like what we're doing with the modern sort of longevity clinics they try to go and do real preventative medicine sort of at the border between geroscience and medicine i don't think it's true geros science yet because many of these compounds probably don't slow aging but if you pick the right one they might add a lot of healthy years to your life as you say if you have some problem and you can diagnose it and and target it that's smart but ultimately due to tois paradox right if you do not slow all causes of aging you will hit the biological limit no matter what relatively soon right it's just a matter identify of identifying which compound would be best for that individual's genetic background but then using objective data like the biomarkers to try to target which of the supplements would be best right i think there's prom is there yeah yeah all right so then all right so now translating it to people right so even though rapy is basically the best pharmacological intervention for extending uh at least mouse lifespan uh what do you what are your thoughts of two prominent rapy long-term users dying and i either so you know blackone blackon died i think 64 brain cancer just recently and uh allen green made it to i think 80ish right so one made it to below average lifespan and the other around the average maybe a little bit above average yeah it's pretty tragic and the optics obviously don't look good but we do have to consider that right now thousands of people are taking ry and and the magic is in the statistics if it really slows longevity so the estimate for mice for me was around 10% of the pooling that is very difficult to measure with a sample size of a handful of people it also extends liv sp marmor that's around 10% and here we have you know 30 50 60 animals so you want to you want to really look at the numbers because the magnitude of the effect will not be large enough to really see you know you know i took romise and i should lift to 95 you know it's yeah for sure two an anecdote of two people like you said versus a population of thousands it's a big difference right but uh but biomarkers right i'm still i'm still trying to figure out which biomarkers you know rap me improves like if you can pick uh you know i mean so for me i think it may even though you get it past the 900 day rule and it's not extending lifespan in a short liv strain um when considering it can suppress the immune system like are we getting you know an improvement of like what is i don't i still don't get in terms of rap m what it's actually improving to potentially increase lifespan we have overall lack of biomarkers in in geros science and it's highly problematic the same can be said for intermittent fasting right maybe it does something it does not seem to improve cardiometabolic health maybe it boost autophagy but how do you measure this we have no good non-invasive biomarkers to prove which is a plausible mechanism same for romy and preclinical data suggest it should you know you know promote translational fality improve autophagy but these things are very hard to measure in humans yeah you'd expect to see it somewhere though right b biomarkers of kidney liver you know immune cells inflammation glucose i mean if none of those you know i think there's one study i forgot the lead author but they uh it was like a a small trial of rapy and and they looked at biomarket changes before and after and it i mean it was basically almost nothing um you know so i don't know if you followed the pearl trial so recently they published the outcome and viseral fat i think seem to be the most promising thing changing with ramy and maybe we'll see crp and larger studies and some sort of inflammation signal yeah so that gets to your you put in uh in the supplementary data the healthy fatness model so yeah can you expand on that it is a strange quirk of mice so maybe their fat metabolism is not a perfect model for humans or maybe there's actually something happening there so some of these dwarves they're literally obese they have really high body fed percentage but their fat tends to be reprogrammed to be less inflammatory and even secrete like beneficial cyto kindes and the same was true in this il's cross for some reason i think the my with a higher body fed percentage tended to survive better and maintaining this body fed was a marker of better survival but as you mentioned uh in your mail to me right it could be a distinction between visceral and subcutaneous fat because the subcutaneous might be beneficial especially on in these special states yeah and visceral visceral fat removal at least in rats with only one study there aren't any replications you know so extends lifespan uh but so i looked into the fco mice so are you familiar with the fat insulin receptor knockout mice i didn't look much into it yeah so uh that extends lifespan too and so i wanted to see okay is it visceral or subcutaneous and you know the hypothesis would be it's probably reducing visceral and that's why they live longer but nobody's looked at that either right so um that could be that could be you know i don't know that could along the lines of your rapy you know that could if rapon is reducing visceral fat that could be a big deal that nobody's thinking about which then goes to the idea of uh the the standards right uh eat less you know be lean regular exercise training um minimize visceral fat as a potential pro longevity approach in people that's a good fun so what h how has this study uh changed your supplemental approach like what you supplement with if you supplement with anything well i always followed the basic guidelines of of this manuscript right so uh my idea was always to look at the best quality mouse data pre-select compounds and then to do an intersection take these compounds and see if they have some interest in human data it can be uh shate end point it can be clinical data and then choose the ones that might slow aging and have some human data so i like taring because it has some moderate evidence on blood pressure and it slows aging in at least one study for for example so i think it can inform you if you're like a biohacker you like self experimentation i think this is is great so you're only supplementing with torine right now out of potential longevity drugs that meet the 900 day rule yes i mean sperin is on my short list because it performs really well in multiple studies but i still need to be a little convinced by a human data but for example yeah sperin because of this is on my short list so what are your thoughts about intake versus degradation right so intake you'd expect to have higher plasma levels of torine or spermine but you know with there may may be many mechanisms that lead to its degradation so for example you could supplement with omega-3 but if you're in a pro-inflammatory state most of that or some of that omega-3 will be degraded systemically into other metabolites so your circulating levels of epa and dha may not be you know uh quotequote optimal or you know be associated with lowest all cause mortality risk so in take as one side of it so do you measure plasma levels of torine or spermine as one means for uh you know targeting dose even i mean the thing that i still used to measure was vitamin d but now i use an empirical dose that is associated with very marginal benefits on cancer mortality in some studies right but if you could measure it reliably these things then it's probably a good idea but you still want to have good prospective epidemiology or other studies suggesting what are the target levels yeah or i don't do much myself oh you don't do that yet but so defining what's optimal may be tricky for example plasma levels of touring you could go by you know populationbased averages but knowing that it can decline during aging at least seeing where your data is in youth and then trying to avoid that age related decline whether by more supplementation or discovering the recipe for what leads to systemic degradation so that's actually how i see part of the story too right so supplementation at least targeted could be a part of the approach for extending average and maximum lifespan but if you know metabolize in pathways that are key in longevity and you know that some things are supposed to decline during aging based on the population based averages and other things are supposed to increase if you could discover the recipe for diet exercise supplements for keeping that youthful biochemical state and kind of having to avoid the parabiosis to get you to that state i'd argue that could be an approach for extending you know at least average lifespan and health span but there's no published data nobody has done a long-term rct it has not there's no public published evidence in support of it so what what do you think about that approach yeah recently i was brainstorming about metabolomics and had this idea right so you measure metabolites how they change with aging and you will probably find dozens hundreds of things that change with aging what would happen if you were not to supplement one of them and normalize one of them perhaps just toren right if you were to normalize all of these things that change with aging like how much could you achieve in terms of benefit it's it's a beautiful idea to be tested yeah so we're there's actually some talk about that and it's i i you know i hear you on the tory and one metabolite it's kind of like you know uh thinking about existence as an ecosystem right human and and microbiome so if you change just the weed in a giant forest do you change the ecosystem of the giant forest which is kind of the analogy you were going for with toine versus all these metabolites but if you look at like just using metabolomic say 600 metabolites or however many can be measured currently commercially uh if you if you know what that pattern looks like in terms of metaboli classes and what it looks like in youth technically any intervention you can see if it shifts the global profile towards a more youthful state independent of one metabolite right technically you can dig deeper and say that i improve cholesterol esters or you know whatever pick your pick your halfway of interest right but that's where i think the field is going is interventions that change you know uh the the global profile whether it's proteomic or any of the omic towards the more youthful state rather than these independent interventions which you know maybe the you know the weed in the forest yeah that brings us back to the whole igf one story so of course a lot of things change with aging but not all of them are m adaptive the average sum of things that change in blood and elsewhere with aging is harmful but some of them will probably be beneficial so sometimes you will if you supplement you might end up still harming yourself but so it would be even better if you would know which of the things that change with aging are harmful and then just select the subset that is that needs to be changed and not change all of them to a youthful state because you know 100% agree right it so it's evaluating the intervention contextually across all organ systems not just all right if i eat a low carb high fat diet i improve metabolic health but then not thinking about what's the global impact on kidney liver immune etc it's what's the net effect right but this is a limitation in academic studies because it's like we have to get funding based on very specific pathways you know it's like do you improve card cardiometabolic health and most studies aren't even looking at the rest of the the picture you know so it's kind of a nir view in some ways yeah cool so what's what's next for you what's the next study what's your path uh finishing the phd after that like where do you see your role in aging science aging research over the next few decades so i'm working on one more similar paper that is sort of a theoretical paper dealing with foundations because i'm really attracted to this kind of topic and i think it can inform the field and readers but ultimately i'm more interested in interventions and slowing aging really substantially so i want want to perhaps commercialize certain compounds and we're interested in combinations um perhaps going for for skin because you can do a lot of high fruit testing in principle in skin it's the regulatory climate is better and i feel like there's potential there so skin aging so your interest your your primary interest would be skin aging going forward that will be one of the things and also other community building right wrting theoretical papers so just i'm interested in the whole pipeline right getting a supplemental product from early data to humans and beyond nice all right wait so uh would the skin approach would that involve like uh testing the microbiome and skin ph all the factors that can impact skin health uh during aging uh well that's not my expertise i'm i'm sure that's interesting but so i have not not considered it so when you think about like uh the evolution of uh interventions right right now it's almost solely based on chemical and although as soon as i start to mention it it it sounds like woo what are your thoughts on like there is published data but you know so like red light therapy you know using parts of the electromagnetic spectrum but then even in some ways sound sound therapy so um ultrasound therapy may be beneficial in some cases in alzheimer's disease patients and rc in rcts so now you've got these you know chemical interventions and then you've got these non-chemical interventions so what do you think about uh uh the non-chemical interventions i mean granted this isn't your work it's just your personal opinion but have you thought about it at all and um yeah a short list of things that i find interesting so some things i think are more like pleasurable and could be have like you know health benefits let's say physiotherapy massage yoga so so there are some weak you know suggestions of improved mortality which i don't fully buy but then there is some potential and hyperbaric that i really want to see explored and heat therapies because the preclinical evidence is is sort of promising there nice and then what's what what do you think the longevity field is slow on right now that or something that's obvious to you besides the 900 day rule like yeah that you think should be you know either addressed or you just think it's comical that people aren't thinking about i don't know slow i mean it's of course no one's fault but we're slow on everything because we like the funding so we're one of the most underfunded fields um we've been slow on reprising for decades like we're just not getting any larger studies off the ground and it's a tragedy with either r or rle locks i think we do pay a little bit too much attention to lifestyle interventions that indeed probably don't work in animal models they probably just provide health spin and no lifes spin benefits so we don't draw a clear line there that's what the field is a bit slow on and then underated oh sorry go ahead no those are like certain issues that i see yeah nice and so underrated aspects of uh studying aging that most people don't know about that you think they should know about besides things like the 900 day rule that would seem ob obvious to you but maybe not so much to other people right so this is sort of the idea from my next theoretical paper that it really takes a multimodal approach it takes multiple interventions combinations and that not one is or currently there is not one that is superior to the others you cannot say exercise is better than vitamin d or fishal because if you start looking at the evidence it breaks down and you really cannot say this you can say that there are multiple pillars and they're all important sleep exercise healthy diet even supplements even drugs people you know have sometimes a very bad naturalistic fallacy type of view on drugs and supplements but they all have a role to play i think this is really underappreciated so uh you mentioned combination therapies so uh rapy plus a carbos extends lifespan and it extends lifespan more than rapy if i remember correctly and i think that data was in the paper and there's obviously yeah i think the itp did that work so is that you see uh combination therapies i think you mentioned combination therapies being a big part of being underrated right now and that's where the field is going to go you know which combinations may be best further maximizing lifespan yeah it just doesn't seem plausible that you could slow aging substantially with just a single drug targeting a single well defined pathway so it must be going there so which combinations would you use other than rapy and uh and you know a carbos just as an example i feel what we're really lacking is for example things that promote dna repair we have a lot of damage removal reduced production of damage approaches you know like r might might do this but to substantially improve dna repair would be great and i think there are some things in the pipeline for that and still stress resistance sort of prevent dna damage without increasing dna repair capacity is still a little bit underexplored so we don't have well we're not quite there but i think these are cool approaches so to add with r are there dna repair uh studies metabolites or supplements that you think would be best to evaluate and it's pretty cool work by b schumer from secar in cologne on um is it inhibitors activat h on the dream complex so drugs that affect the dream complex and dna repair enzymes nice but no lifespan data on that yet no none of it not yet cool all right so that's all i've got i appreciate you uh camille uh is there anything i didn't ask you that i should have asked you that is is obvious um no i think we covered quite a lot i me we could go on for hours but i think we already covered quite quite a nice range of topics cool well thanks again cille and i'm looking forward to your progress in the field and uh we'll chat again soon soon
