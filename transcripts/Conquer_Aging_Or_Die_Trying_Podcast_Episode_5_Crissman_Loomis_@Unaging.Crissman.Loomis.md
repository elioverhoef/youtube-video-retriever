Hey everyone today's guest is chris man channel regular chris man lumis and if you don't know who chris man is he's the face and brains behind unaging tocom so uh check it out so with that in mind welcome chris and what's on the agenda for today thanks mike it's uh it's always a pleasure to talk to you so we've got a few things i've had some um uh revelations or new thoughts over the past couple of months and i'm looking forward to sharing with them with you so let's go over our topics so the things i think we can talk about today uh first of all is i've done some analysis crunch some of the numbers uh to go into the tiers of longevity so we can see what are the top interventions or habits that you can do that'll give you the most life then after we talk about that a bit i thought we could um talk about calorie restriction in humans for a long time it's been thought that this is one of the primary ways that you could extend life in humans and i want to talk about some of the recent findings on that after that we can go talk about biomarket turning ver tuning versus habit changes so which of them is better what's the better focus to take your look at and then finally i'd like to give an update on the unaging challenge for 2025 and how things are going with the early adopters so that's the that's the layout um uh sound good for you yeah longevity tear looks like two and three looks like two and three is challenging the conquer aging or die trying uh uh approach so yeah let's let's get into it right should be good okay so starting with the tiers of uh longevity intervention so uh the the research here is basically um pulled from various sources so i've gone over as i've been writing my unaging blog over the years the various different ways that you can uh change your all cause mortality so i find that it uh i don't like to get caught into the weeds of changing the chance of cancer or cardiovascular i want to look at the big picture and say overall what are the best interventions that you can do to live the longest amount of time and i've gone over health habits i've gone over diet habits i've gone over uh habit habits like son and other things and as much as possible quantified them so i took those numbers that i had figured out and then ran them through a actuarial table um this is based off of assuming someone who is a 40-year-old male uh if you're older than 40 uh you won't quite as get as much benefit if you're younger you'll get more um if you're a woman you'll get a little bit less because you're already going to living quite a little a little bit longer than men but this then gives an idea of how much benefits you could get for any particular intervention so you'll notice also that there's a green side of it and then also there's um a gray side of it so the green side is basically what the average uh american or developed country person would get from doing this intervention so for some of these for example um like eating vegetables or things uh a good number of people fortunately already do eat some vegetables so the net benefit of it is not that great but of course if you look at this and you're not doing it at all um say for instance if you are not doing uh any walking uh then increasing your walking will have more of a benefit you can capture not only the green benefit of it which is over seven years but also you could get additional benefit as well and for some of the interventions the bo the point actually is that you want to do less of them um down number three on the list is smoking um which we know has negative impacts in multiple areas so quitting smoking will then get you um by stopping it will give you the benefit of extra years of life so going ahead and jumping into then um the two top tiers the s tier and the a tier interventions in the a in the s tier we have the number one walk uh number one intervention which is walking basically just simply walking about 12,000 steps a day 10,000 is good and the first of course 8,000 steps are the most impactful you can gain about another seven years of life it's amazing that i a lot of the gurus that we hear about talk about how important it is to do the other activities because they're seeing as more challenging and not everyone does them but many people think of it as the first thing for longevity but but the number one intervention that gives over about a 75% reduction all cause mortality is walking about 12,000 steps every day so i give that its own tier as the s tier and after that then we start to go into the a tier and you'll notice that the a tier is the other physical interventions for the most part it's things like high-intensity interval training called hit here on the chart um doing aerobic exercise which is where you're going at more of a steady state but at a high enough rate it's difficult to breathe um your uh heavy breathing and then also strength training once a week to uh build up the muscles as well there are a few other uh habits here uh as i talked about smoking unfortunately i i don't feel like i need to tell too many people that smoking isn't healthy for you but smoking isn't healthy for you um and another one there is sauna which is somewhat less known uh unless you're living in finland that it also is one of the top actually of the a tier interventions it'll give you quite a bit more life it's about a 35% reduction or more just going to the sauna for about 10 to 20 minutes uh several times a week so this then covers off the s tier and the a tier and then after that then we come to the b tier and it's interesting because the b tier is kind of a bunch of the very top food habits that maybe you don't actually think of um very at the top of the list there i call it drip uh which is my abbreviation for drip coffee uh it's important that it be drip coffee as opposed to an espresso because some of the oils in an espresso or latte are not as healthy and another equivalent of that basically is tea um if you do both of these things you don't get twice the benefit they seem to overlap in some ways especially in the caffeine which is about half the benefit of either tea or coffee um and other interventions we have here is whole grains uh which is one of the uh most reliable interventions cu you can have up to three to four servings of whole grains and that could be whole wheat pasta cereal granola whole wheat bread or other things and it just seems to continue to be healthy throughout there's not as much of a one dose is good and then the second dose is not as good it seems to be a consistent benefit the more of it you eat in contrast to that the next intervention is nuts um but nuts is a one serving intervention basically all you can eat is one serving of nuts about 30 gram actually not even a full um ounce about 20 gram of it and you get the full benefit as far as gram for gram life there's nothing that beats nuts and olive oil is another popular alternative to this that basically gives the same benefit underneath that we have the only supplement to grace the list which is glucosamin um the condroitin often times it comes together but it seems like the glucosamin is the actual one with the benefit there's questions about how effective it actually is for the um primary purpose which is joints and knees uh treatment but it's uh very inexpensive it's heavily tested with very few side effects although uh glaucoma is one of the possible side effects so if that's a concern for you i don't recommend it um and it's shown to have a significant decrease in um premature death and then the last one that's sort of on the borderline between the b and the c tier is fish um having about one or two servings of fish up to 200 grams also gives a significant increase in all in lifespan so then we get to the c tier and this is kind of interesting i think this is like the sin tier if you will um the things here are oftentimes talked about as maybe not healthy and um there are already a lot of people who don't take that much of them um here we have things like processed meat um sugary beverages any um beverage that is only bringing sugar like a soda or um iced tea can be overly sweetened um orange juice is another one that seems healthy but really it's just liquid sugar for the most part um these things unfortunately will shorten your life and so cutting them out can give you additional lifespan uh legumes or beans also appears on this list as one of the good things that can be done um with one or two servings around 40 to 80 grams a day uh eggs is okay at the rate of about half an egg a day or an egg every other day or so and but over that i don't really know whether it's the cholesterol or whether it's uh what it is but it's uh shown in the observational studies that basically having an egg or more a day starts to reduce your expected lifespan and the same is true with red meat um you can see for red meat that um while not many people eat that much of it um there are some people who eat a lot of it um that's why the bar extends quite a bit over to the left side for people who need um who eat more meat than is healthy for them um and then the last one in this tier is flossing fortunately most people do uh floss but if you don't floss it can be a significant increase in your overall longevity and then we get to the d tier and sometimes i think of this as a distraction tier um because the things here while they do extend your life they're often times oversell and many people are doing most to them the beneficial amount already um we have both fruits and vegetables appear on this list um but most people are already eating a serving or two of fruits a day and the observational studies don't show that much benefit beyond one or two servings a day decaffeinated coffee is not as healthy as caffeinated coffee but if the caffeine is doing a thing for you this is better than nothing uh for people who are sensitive to caffeine um another one here the peppers this is uh red peppers so if you eat a whole red pepper about once a month once every other week or so it shows significant benefits as far as longevity um some of the other uh vitamin or um spices do as well such as uh uh garlic or some of the others or turmeric can have a similar benefit and then also we have things on here like brushing your teeth again most people do this so the additional benefit for most people it's telling people what they already know that brushing your teeth every night gives a longevity benefit brushing your teeth in the morning is good for breath and other things but it doesn't seem to be tied into reducing all cause mortality and then again instant coffee which also has benefit um even if it's caffeinated you can get the caffeine benefit out of it although the panol and other benefit seems to disappear so it's not as significant and then there are some things which don't really make a difference um refined grains uh white bread and other things it's not negative you eat it it doesn't shorten your lifespan but doesn't give you additional time either and the same is true of poultry which is sort of the neutral protein source so those are the the tiers of longevity um do you have any questions or comments about that mike yeah so i got a whole bunch of questions and comments so first um hopefully you can provide all the references you know so that we can and then we can put it in the um videos description or the pin comments and then people can check out the studies just so they know that you're not just pulling these data at a thin air right yeah i'm uh i mean the foods are all in one are pretty much all in one study um but i've written um i think around uh coming up on a hundred i think more than 50 blog articles and uh for instance if you there's a oral biome microbiome will then tell you about the flossing the dental care um and other things but i'm happy to provide those links and then people can take a look at it yeah cool all right and then so just starting from the top right so um you've got walking basically is the top top of the top even beating the uh potential gain and lifespan for you know aerobic training strength training even hit right so how does that mesh with the v2 max studies where okay i get 12,000 steps you're you're going to have significant uh reduction or 12,000 steps is significantly associated with reduced all cause mortality risk as is higher aerobic capacity muscle strength and you know obviously hit is a is a component of that but how do the how do you square the circle with basically higher v2 maxes which can't be achieved by walking i mean you can walk all you want you'll have a higher v2 max relative to someone who's sedentary but people who are engaged in regular vigorous exercise training will have higher vo2 maxes and a higher vo2 max will be associated with a lower all cause mortality risk relative to someone who's walking right so how do you square that circle for walking's potential lifespan gain here on your chart versus the vo2 max studies so there um each of these components um as i've gone through my studies are uh independent of each other other so um the fact that you can gain this much additional um expected life or have this much of a reduction in premature death from walking is in no way reducing or um competing with the benefits that you get from having a higher v2 max um just as eating um lots of whole grains is going to increase your lifespan without affecting your v2 max at all it's the same thing for walking that going for a long walk seems to have outsize benefits even among people who do aerobic exercise as well and this is was one of the interesting things for me is that it really is a different thing um so in the in the unaging challenge one of the challenges the early adopters are finding is that getting 12,000 steps a day takes a long time and uh they've already been going through the challenge and they've already been doing things like doing aerobics and high-intensity interval training but you can't count those steps towards the walking because they're separate and distinct so i consider to be um in overall fitness and longevity walking is a different bucket if you will um than the other exercises so i don't think they conflict and they're additional in the benefits you can get from them all right so the way you've got it then is make sure you're doing some amount of aerobic and strength training some hit but then also get 12,000 steps in per day that's how you're inter interpreting that all right i prefer so this gets into the this gets ahead of the the the the bait sl fight slash you know whatever you want to call it but you know i prefer greater i prefer greater specificity right if you're uh v2 max just using that as an example or your muscle strength arms and legs pick pick pick a pick grip strength uh squat deadlift whatever it may be if you're at the top 1% or elite of the elites or the best that your body can handle would you even need walking right so then it gets the idea of specificity right uh can you use a more quantified approach or conversely if you're doing i don't know 20,000 steps do you need any aerobic training or strength or hit right so um you know i get the general recommendations but then how do you personalize that so that you've got a more specific recommendation for not just walking verse or how much walking within the context of the other health health promoting behavior yeah you're hitting on something that's um for shadowing our our upcoming discussions as well because there really there really isn't a biometric that changes by walking right is you're if okay if i if i do my aerobics or something then i can tell my v2 max is increased my resting heart rate has gone down if i do strength training i can lift more literally um and uh have grip strength and other things uh but you're absolutely the right for walking there really isn't a metric aside from how many steps did you walk that tells you that you've done it and yet the results in all cause mortality are unmistakable it's not it's one of the things that i struggle with just for the reason that you're saying is okay well what did it do for you right um and yet in in study after study this is very reliable with a a very low um p factor um repeatedly replicated that the people who walk the most live the longest in those studies though it seems like it's one or the other though i don't know that there's a quotequote healthy control group where you know they're running on the treadmill at i don't know whatever speed and you know doing heavy compound lifts and then also walking 12,000 steps seems like that's one or the other where you've got a general population that happens to walk a lot on a little or less and isn't doing any of the vigorous training so i think it'd be interesting to look at head-to-head study you know for the for the walkers versus you know the high performance athletes and then how much walking do you need if you're a high performance athlete is it none what amount is it and then conversely would some amount of regular you know uh training above walking be beneficial for those who walk a lot right so that's how that's how i would you know interpret that yeah i think um i think there i don't have the study off the top of my head but i think there was a study that actually looked at specifically the aerobic fitness and the walking fitness and found that they were additive on each other of course for all these things um uh as a spoiler like if you did everything perfect on all of these tiers um the the last additions are not going to get you any life anyway so as you talk about someone who's already an elite athlete if you already have an elite athlete let's say who's eating an outstanding meal and also goes to the sauna has never smoked etc you're probably right that person probably has maxed out already what they could get um virtually no one lives past 110 you get your own wiki you get an entry in the wikipedia page if you live past 110 so um it definitely is true that you can max it out with some of the other things if walking takes up too much time or it's not something that uh you enjoy there's definitely the ability to pick here but if you have to pick one or two one of them should be walking yeah which then also gets a dose right uh what do you think about the overtrained phenotype because if you're doing five six days of an hour an an hour day of strength and cardio and everything else and then are adding 12,000 steps which is another six miles of volume you you're basically now training three hours a day instead of one hard training per day are you overtrained and is that overtrained will that overtraining phenotype lead to less strength and cardio performance in your training move you know your training activities right so and then will that negatively impact health and lifespan so what do you what do you think about that well there's a there's an acclimatization time to getting used to walking i have a a walking desk as i i've appeared in one of our first videos actually walking on my um treadmill underneath my desk that i do my work on and a regular day for me is going to be 30,000 steps um that's kind of standard um honestly i don't think i'm getting benefit after the first 12 or 15,000 as we talked about but i'm still on my desk and i don't have a chair so away i go um but i think that um basically the the walking the benefit of it is is that you don't it doesn't wear you out like if i walk for two hours and then do my exercise or i just do my exercise i don't notice any difference in my overtraining or readiness to do the exercise um i find that in a couple of things there seems to be that trade-off between them for example in the aerobic exercise if you're just doing aerobic the um the maxed period is somewhere about um five hours or so and after five hours of solid aerobic like if you're running more than five hours a week you'll begin to edge into the overtrained and the longevity benefits begin to disappear for the high intensity section se uh sessions the total high intensity time once that gets to around an hour and a half now you're already getting the overtrained point and again you'll start to see the longevity benefits start to go away and also you'll start to see the v2 max go down as you're literally overtrained um and that's also i've seen that come up in a few studies but for walking i'm not aware of any particular number where they say whoa whoa don't walk that much when they go out to the uh the the tribes and things right and the primitive people who are living the hunter gather life they walk all day long and they're fine yeah but then it's that that still goes back to they're doing one or the other the walkers aren't doing vigorous training and probably the vigorous training are doing some walking but not a lot of walking everybody so just to circle back to the aiz and acclamation to the higher training load you know adding walking to an already pre-existing train approach um so i don't think everybody can adapt to a higher training volume and i think there are limits to that so just use an analogy from sports so in baseball you'll have pitchers who will start their careers thinking they're going to be a starting pitcher and a starting pitcher generally or in the past in the 70s and 80s used to throw 250 innings so when when they're 18 years old that you know they would start throwing a lot of innings well some of those pitchers couldn't throw a lot of innings so now instead of their arms their physiology just can't handle it so instead of throwing 250 innings and for some teams it takes many years to figure out that they're not a 250 inning workhorse they're only capable of throwing 60 to 70 innings before they start breaking down so i think the same idea translates to to uh you know human physiology when it comes to exercise and longevity i mean more is not necessarily better and then it becomes you know what kind of horse are you are you it seems like you've got you know keep training your body's going to keep adapting no matter what i unfortunately i have the mindset to do that but my physiology does not react uh you know well in that case so um so yeah just that nuance of trying to then that gets to dose how do you figure out if you're in the overtrained zone regardless of what is quote unquote associated with it in published studies right which goes back to heart rate variability resting heart rate you know uh trying to get closer to the dose that's the only that's the only weak spot that i see in the broad-based you know epi studies is there just no specificity on those like for example you know how many whole grains right is it five servings is it three servings maybe my physiology is one serving right or conversely the nuts maybe it's not one serving maybe my physiology is better when i have three or four but you'd have to actually measure biomarkers and do that you know iterative correlation uh process over time to see how much is truly optimal at the individual level maybe maybe some people thrive not eating any of these foods and just on you know 400 grams of animal prodct products have fantastic biomarker data and everything else and feel better and you know so uh i appreciate the ep studies i think that's a good guide but you know there's got to be a more titrated way to get it dose yeah we need we need more loose cartens out there to uh be measuring every gram and everything and then and and doing different things right um so that we can see sort of how the effects are um obviously these are done in observational studies and individual variation kind of get blurred into the average so yeah for some of those people maybe it was five servings of nuts and some of them it was even a half a serving yeah and then in most of the large epi studies too even though you've got very large populations i think it's biased towards the unhealthy user and not necessarily the healthy user the healthy user is so small so small of a group that i wonder if it just gets buried in a noise and then you're looking at basically quote unquote sick versus sicker people right so uh all wait a couple of a couple of other intervention that i don't see on your list would be leanness not necessarily bmi but you know so for example um you know you could eat all of the quote unquote real food i mean basically this approach this stills down to the jacalan approach eat real food and exercise right but um you know you could eat all of these foods but if your bmi is 35 you know versus something less and that's not to poop on people worth 35 they're just more likely to be metabolically unhealthy just as an example you know so i think leanness uh but then even that's a debatable topic right is it based on bmi probably not and then it's like what body fat percentage do you want which then divides it even further which should be on the list potentially visceral fat visceral fat um you know increases during aging is associated with insulin resistance and a whole bunch of bad health related outcomes so i that could be on the list i've got a couple more too sleep sleep quality uh sleep duration and quality quity so sleep duration goes down with age slow wave sleep goes down with age which is associated with dementia risk um and then last but not least sunlight right how much sunlight to get not just vitamin d but the red and near infrared light which can potentially improve mitochondrial function to some degree and glucose levels based on at least one rct um you know so that i would add those very and i got a couple other variables too but what do you think i think uh you're absolutely right about those um for in some ways i've tr i've tried to focus on the things that i thought were most actionable um and uh body fat for whatever it's worth although um thanks to modern drugs and glp1 and other things it's more uh actionable than it was before but um going to someone who's overweight and saying hey why don't you not be overweight is um is not an it's not an easy ask and it's a lot of work to be honest so i did do uh some research on that one i know that the uh staying within a lean weight is about uh probably about a um it's about a b tier i think and if you're overweight then losing just a couple of pounds even you don't have to get down to like a low body weight the metabolic change uh correction is much faster than the weight loss so the encouraging thing is if you are overweight just starting on the road to losing weight gives you the health benefits almost immediately it takes a lot while longer to see the to have the scale reaffirm what you you've done um but the benefits come more quickly and that's about a 10% uh recovery in reduction in premature death the sleep one for example um that's about a 10% or so um increase in all cause mortality and mostly the big problem there is for people sleeping too long uh if you're sleeping say five hours instead of seven hours it's about a 3% it would definitely be de d tier um i think sleep is uh overrated uh as an intervention um the visceral fat stuff i don't have numbers on that one i haven't done that one again it's that one's really hard to say um you should fix your visceral fat right i mean uh losing a particular kind of fat is even more difficult i think than losing overall fat so uh there are definitely some things that i that could be added on here and the sun is is also i i watched your uh recent podcast and i'm i'm excited to get into that and i'll be following up with that myself as well to see how i think the numbers shake out quality air quality so air pollution um you know that's another one which is associated with mortality risk and then also water purity right so if you're drinking lead contaminated water and don't know it that's potentially bad at least for biological age so um but then even there there's nuance how clean and pure should the water be are you stripping everything reverse osmosis and then you got to add back in the you know vitamins and minerals you know to to make it more palatable and uh you know less soft right so those i would add those two air air air pollution and water probably like one of the one of the ones that i would like to add to the list that i struggle with myself is the social contact measures right i mean we know that um that loneliness kills um and that's one that it's really hard to to quantify and get good data on um are you happy how lonely are you right or stress is another one that i would add uh if i could get better numbers on it um to quantify how much stress people are under and then see how that affects their overall longevity these are things that we know have a big impact maybe they would bump walking off of the s tier um but it's very hard to get good numbers on them and to quantify them effectively cool all right ready for topic number two all right sure okay so see calorie restriction is it beneficial for humans right so before we get into this i want to emphasize that uh we've been doing these uh podcasts now a few times and uh i think that there are a lot of things that we agree on as we've already uh saw just when we were talking about the tears for instance i think we both agree that diet is important i think we both agree that exercise is good and that supplements have lower value i wouldn't say no value but it's not the first thing to look at when trying to live a longer life does that seem fair yes okay i mean it depends though because some people could say that supplements with 100 taking 100 or 150 supplements is doing something but uh the foundation diet exercise but then i would also add sleep air quality water pollution some amount of sunlight exposure i mean sure yes we got more podcasts to go still right but you know i mean those are the things we agree on and we've talked about them a few times but i think it's time we got down to brass tax and had a fight about some of the things that i don't think we do agree on so uh are you uh you ready to uh to go at it born ready all right one minute all right doctor gota get you gotta get all you gotta get all fight fight geared up to to bring the to bring the noise right i i need i need to armor up i don't want to hurt you too much you know i i think we still have some future podcasts ahead of us but uh see you've been talking about this calorie restriction and you've been eating less calories than you need to but the thing is is that you also gave hosted a presentation from uh camille paas if i remember his i'm pus if i'm pronouncing his name right so he visited your podcast and he talked about the impact of shortlived controls on calor restriction and basically as he went through it he found that the calorie restriction that they show in the animals only works in the really small animals like basically the lowest weight animals so for any one of the four interventions they do whether it's in yeast cells or fruit flies or mice the top 10% have no benefit from calor restriction at all and these are even in the animals and it's only in the bottom 10% by weight that get any benefit from it and so a natural question out of that is are humans more like fat rats or like lean rats how long do we live for our size well this has already been answered here's a statistical analysis that went through and it measured every animal they could find on how long it lived versus how much it weighed and you can see down there in the lower left we have mice underperforming the amount of time that you expect them to live given their body weight and then all the way at the upper top of it we see humans who are live much longer than you would expect for our physical size in fact we live five times as long as would be expected just based off of our weight so when we're looking trying to compare ourselves to these fruit flies or other things none of them live anywhere as long as a human does just based off of how long you would expect something to live based off of their weight and then if we go further into that one of the natural places to look is you're thinking about uh longevity and you mentioned this is one of the things that should be on the tear is the mortality based on body weight for a human so if it was true that eating low calories for an extended period of time was the key to longevity then naturally you would be seeing that that the people who weigh the least would then live the longest but we don't see that at all in fact the people who weigh the least actually die 50% a 50% higher all cause mortality than people who have a normal bmi of between 20 and 25 so it only starts to go up as as we mentioned before when you start to get into a heavy bmi but if you're in a normal range there's really not that much benefit from eating less calories and you could say well i'm doing calorie restriction i'm not just losing weight well the people who are doing calorie restriction almost all of them are very low bmi an average of around 18 or so which is at the point that it's significantly increased all cause mortality and this has already been uh data has already been cleaned to remove the smoking people one way to lose weight unfortunately is to smoke um it's also been corrected for the level of activity and exercise and class and and age and other things so this is basically saying that the humans that are living in the normal range can't get any additional benefit just from trying to reduce reduce their calories and live a life of deprivation you want to go ahead and uh give some uh give a swing back yeah so if we're starting with the 900 day rule um a major takea away from that paper to was that uh cr was one of the few interventions to consistently allow mice to live longer than 900 days so if 900 days if median lifespan 900 days is a short live control cr was one of the few intervention where consistently the uh mice live longer than 900 days and if i can if i can uh share screen here so i can show that data can't share you've got to give me share privileges there we go all right hang on real quick yeah so if you look at one of the recent studies uh that just came out and i don't know wait let's see if you can see what i see let me uh go full yep all right okay so this study uh just came out and there for those who haven't seen it videos on the channel um the importance of this study and not to say this is any different from the 900 day rule but it it's additive because this is uh recently published so it wasn't available when uh camille's group published uh his data anyway this study included 960 mice so that's a key point because when you look at any lifespan studies if your if your two groups or however many groups have eight mice per per intervention or controls it's not adequately powered to look at lifespan so each of these five groups eat as much as you wanted add li one day of fasting two days of fasting 20% cr 40% cr five groups 960 mice in total divide that by five that's how many mice were in each group a lot of mice grant and also it's in female mice so i can't say anything about male mice in this study so when you look at the 900 day rule that's about 30 months right here median lifespan so compared to ad lib you can see that relative relatively short short lived was but an increase in lifespan relative to the short live uh ad li eat as much as you wanted both one and two days of fasting so maybe you can cross off one and two days of of fasting as being potentially relevant because it increased lifespan relative to the uh short live controls who live shorter than 900 days you could also make that same claim about um or actually where now where you start to see the lightband curve go beyond 30 months or sorry sorry now then even 20% cr you can see 20% cr median lifespan is right at n is right at 30 months 900 days so um you there too you could say okay 20% cr no extension of lifespan if you use the uh 900 day rule and you know basically your ad li there those are short live controls but then you can see 40% cr very clearly way past the 30-day rule so you could say okay the 40% cr is pretty extreme almost nobody can handle handle that and where i i prefer nuance to everything you just mentioned is that um while it's true that absolute cr is probably bad right it's you can't say uh eat as little as possible have a bmi of 18 right i i that's something i've never proposed ever and i never would propose right it's it's find the body weight and body composition that's associated with your best biomarker profile in terms of how does that biomarker look bi how do those biomarkers look in terms of youth and their association with all cause mortality risk so in other words it used to be calorie restriction with optimal nutrition c n i'd add to that c n and optimal biomarkers so konob right so i guess i just phrase and it's probably terrible name we can come up with other names but highlight highlight that point just using this study again as an example when using the um not not the 30-day rule but taking it even a step further and looking at uh mice that lived in any group past 35 months which clearly beats the 30-day rule right so you can see that even in the mice that ate as much as they wanted there were still a pretty good amount that lived longer than 35 months and got close to the you know 40 more than 40 months which is long live for a mouse and obviously as you go up the groups you know uh fasting uh there you know they more mice in the both cr groups that live past 35 months but the author authors of the study then asked which biomarkers are associated with a longer lifespan without even looking if the animals were cr or not right so the one day of fasting they weren't cr two days of fasting ended up being cr so you have two groups that are essentially not cr and three groups that ended up being cr so in terms of biomarkers that were associated with a longer lifespan regardless of which group those mice were in having higher levels of lymphocytes at a relatively young age 16 months associated with a longer lifespan and on the other side having a higher rdw which as many people know on the channel is a major predictor of biological age using dr morgan le bean's bi biological age test feno age having a higher value for that regardless of group group designation was associated with a shorter lifespan so these data aren't just in mice these this story is similar in people the rdw increases during aging this is in people again and a relatively higher r w is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and conversely lymphocytes decline during aging just like they did in that giant mouth study uh with lower levels of lymphocytes being associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so just to go back to your original your original point it isn't an absolute cr where lower is better get your bmi as low as possible i look at it as find the magnitude of cr that's best associated with your most youthful and quote unquote healthy lowest all cause mortality risk biomarker profile uh but then also how do you feel because if you're tired and hungry probably too extreme right so and it may be different for everyone you know just as another example on this just to add more context so there's a genetic model of obese mice called the obi obi mouse where they're they're they're they're fat little mice so um if you calor restrict them and i'm not talking about like 40% cr just a mild calorie restriction their life sp is is as long as uh you know 40% cr so you could say how is that possible and they're still fat there're they have a genetic model of obesity which ties back into your point of there's something about eating below your set point and what that is maybe different for everyone is it 10% is it 30% for me around 22 23% cr maybe best if i go go below that my biomarkers like lymphocytes for example start to look aged so but how restricting the ob ob mouse leads to a lifespan as long as classical cr but yet they're not at a body composition or body weight as the classical cr group so there's something about the the a mild even a mild energy restriction um that can maybe it's turning on quotequote proong longevity pathways but then to add one last point whether or not that will translate in people who knows we'll see right but uh you know there's there's no way to know we've got to do the 70-year longitudinal study yeah well we've got to um well first of all as i mentioned before i'm not i'm not at all confident that mice uh results then can be extrapolated to people um that's one of the big questions that's not clear and i i think that the answer to that especially because the strains of mice that we have have been inbred for years um they've uh they're domesticated if you will and they're used to getting tons and tons of food um when they try these uh calorie restriction experiments with wild strain that are just recently brought into the lab they find no benefit of the calor restriction among mice or other things or with animals that are not tamed like uh basically our yeast cells or fruit flies or other things that have spent generations in captivity um the study is interesting though um and that one actually came out after the 900 the 900 day study interesting all right i'll have to take a look at it yeah so wait so to add to add to some more context so i'm not saying that let's use the animal studies and just marry that as an idea and hold on to it with faith and and absolutism and i'm gonna have a bmi of 18 and i'm going to live super long because of it and do nothing else like i think that approach is flawed which goes back to the biomarkers right if you're on some amount of cr just even using the most simple biomarkers and forgetting about any animal studies in lifespan if you're at some level of calories and you cut that that by say 10% 2,800 calories you cut that to by 280 calories a day now you're 2520 a day are your biomarkers improved what's your glucose just using the very simple example right glucose right it increases during aging relatively higher levels associated with an increased all cause mortality risk if your glucose levels go from 107 on average fasting to 85 on a 10% cr and maybe that happens maybe that doesn't and your hb1c drops from i don't know 6 2 to 5.1 seems like calorie restriction in that case has put you on the path of metabolic health now i'm not saying that will happen but this is one way how we get closer towards will any magnitude of cr be good for health and potentially longevity and people but then and if that is true then it raises the question what magnitude of cr may be best and not just for glucose because it's very easy to be reductionist and only focus on metabolic health whether it's glucose lipoproteins how do your kid function markers look and your liver function markers and and then the bigger question is if you're tracking your biomarker data over a few years how does that compare to where it was before you were on cr have you slowed any rate of a so if you have three years of data without cr then you have three years of data with cr with say you know as i'm tracking eight blood tests per year you can look at differences you know in blood pressure and and kidney function liver function hscrp does that data look better than where it did before and if it looks better that would suggest that cr is a part of that approach whatever magnitude of cr1 might be on is beneficial for health now how does that translate i don't know but i'd rather place my bet on the objective biomarkers of health rather than the absolutism of you know this has been shown to work you know many people right now are supplementing based using this similar approach like akg extends lifespan but if you do that 900 day rule the controls are shortlived and the akg supplemented group only extended lifespan in the female mice not male mice but yet the majority of the longevity space is male dominated not female you know more males and females so most of the people taking akg are men but yet the lipan study that that's based on is didn't extend lifespan in the male mice and in the female mice they didn't get past 900 days so um anyway it's the same idea of not using an absolutism it's about looking you know use whatever intervention it may be whether it's cr or supplements or you know exercise prescription what are the what do the objective metrics say collect a lot of data and then track that over time and see is your approach really beneficial neutral or detrimental just one last note so there's a famous uh person in this space who posted his uh data uh a lot of it today with no dates on it just i'm the most quantified person in the world these are my data this is all the healthy stuff blood glucose was 74 and and hb1c was 4.5 now if you use the idea of you know like any m if well you say impressive but i'd argue the opposite side because if if if you use the absolutist approach of calor restriction well that means that a bmi of 16 anorexia is going to be longevity no that that's not what i'm saying there's nuance to this right so what does a published data show so 80 to 94 lowest risk all cause mortality 7 74 is below that for hba1c the all cause mortality data is in met giant meta analyses as many studies as you can collect five to six% now then you you should you know that you could say well closer to five may be optimal relative to six h1c increases during aging but in very advanced ages the liver output of uh blood sugar gluconeogenesis liver function declines that's one reason why ldl declines towards the end of life so it's possible that gluconeogenesis could be impaired whether extreme exercise or whether it's an extreme magnitude of calorie restriction and if that's the case the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels will be less good than it should be so is 74 with an hba1c of 4.5 better somehow even though the published data suggests that that's not the case this is where the nuance comes into it right um so granted his liver markers his liver markers are youthful i looked at those so it's not probably a liver story and he's probably not at increased all cause mortality risk with the 74 4.5 but anyway evaluating within that context is important biomarker right well you're you're trying to get into round two already mike we haven't even finished round one here so let's just uh move on then until the uh the next shot here because i think you're overring on biomarkers so biomarker tuning versus habit changes which is which is the bigger gain let's uh let's talk about it so um so this is the slide that you uh wanted to bring up but uh i think uh you know you just like slipped into this round before we even had the bell ring here so i want to go ahead and present my case of it first and you can have your bottle is that fair sure okay so um this is the one of the biomarkers that you use right again i'm referring to your materials this is a lavine test um pheno age right which goes over a bunch of the biomarkers and you were talking about some of these specifically we have um let's see we've got the alp in there which is a liver enzyme we've got the albumin um also the glucose which you just mentioned so in the lavine's test basically the lower glucose is considered to be better and therefore longer uh younger youth more youthful but if we take a look at um glucose and the associ between fast and glucose and all cause mortality some interesting things show up and this is where i think think uh the biomarkers can lead you astray like if you look at the the change in fast and glucose as you get older it goes up basically from around 84 up until about 96 depending on as your age goes by and so we can take a look then and you're um glucose was something like 88 or something so according to this table then that would give you uh an age of around 30 or something and you can say i'm winning i'm youthful my glucose is lower than it is but the same study goes on then to take a look and let's see how all cause mortality is related to glucose and so here we can see that basically the hazard ratio for the various different glucose levels are all virtually the same like around the area between let's say uh 80 to 105 it doesn't matter what your glucose uh is your premature death rate is virtually the same it's unaffected real quick 80 to 94 was lowest risk as you go above 94 risk significantly increased so 94 is different from 105 and as you go below 80 that was associated with sign significantly increased risk so the lowest risk was 80 to 94 and then the as you go above above that on both sides of the u significantly increased risk so 105 is significantly higher than 94 with an increased risk you're are you referring to this study or a different study yeah this study very you're eyeballing that and you're saying wow that's a big risk there at at 80 no no no i i've i'm very familiar with this study i've looked at the stats 80 to 94 was lowest all ca mortality risk as you go above 94 that was significantly increased risk um and then even if even if you you know when you go back and others go back and take a look at that data and see that that's exactly what it is in terms of the hazard ratio when the when the triangle is completely above one then it's a significant association so if you look at that it's if by eyeballing you can see that right before around 100 that's the case where that triangle is completely above a hazard ratio of one and then on the other side too that starts to be true around 80 right so just eyeballing it you can see that that's true right but you're you're using the term significant in the technical sense of the word which is to say statistically significant that you could retest and probably would have the same result in common parlament when you talk about significant you mean that you would actually notice like you would actually live a longer amount of time but the the amount of the hazard ratio for those kind of numbers here uh okay if you squint at that uh you know i have to look over towards where ma sheen is here you can see that it is above the 1.0 line but if you went through an intervention or you tried to change that you would be changing your life in the manner of what minutes hours of expected lifespan so there's another layer there so glucose increases during aging so if your data and remember this isn't about one blood test so if you're looking at years of blood test data and uh you know your data is where mine is on average around 90 then it's 92 94 96 98 you may look at that as well your risk you know you're at 98 your risk is fine you're within that you're within the quote unquote reference range which is less than i don't know whatever it is in 105 you go to the doctor's office right but your data is going in the wrong way and that rate of change is potentially bad for health and and lifespan if we're talking about maximizing health and lifespan i'd imagine being able to keep your glucose levels flat indefinitely will lead to the longest health and lifespan gain whereas if your data is 80 82 just go up two units every you know 10 years for 20 years your health has gotten worse even though you're still quote unquote within range now the other side of it too as i mentioned when considering that liver function declines toward w the end of life sure maybe your data you start to see it go from 90 to 88 to 84 but going in the other direction right you think oh higher is worse right yeah but also too low is bad too and if that rate of change starts to put you at 76 74 68 you've probably got some liver at least some liver related issues going on uh but rate of change which is almost never reported in studies how because you need it needs to be a longitudinal study with a lot lot of data for each person very rare sorry well let's let's take a look at that so you say that okay well if it's uh let's say that you say 90 and you think okay but that's 90 now and maybe you're 40 years old but we saw that rate of change in the previous one here so if you're 40 years old and let's say you're at 90 just in natural aging you could expect that your increase then i mean the entire range of this goes basically 12 points from 16 until uh over 60 and it doesn't continue to increase much after the age of um for men after the age of 52 so if you have a 90 uh glucose at the age of 40 okay maybe you're going to have um a 93 at the age of 60 and then it stays there for the period and again when you talk when you talk about the significance of this i mean statistically significant sure but as far as a a haj's effect size or a d effect size it's going to be uh virtually unmeasurable and unnoticeable you'll be talking about less than months maybe like a week or something expected life change i just don't think it's worthwhile to concern yourself with it all right so if you put it perspective let's say your average glucose in your 20s is 84 your average glucose in your 30s is 88 your average glucose in your 40s is 92 right clearly the rate of change is going in the wrong direction clearly your metabolic quote unquote health in your 40s is worse than it was in the 20s now you could you can make the argument what does that translate into in terms of all cause mortality risk you could make the argument for health span right having having your rate of age rate of change go in the wrong direction so where your 40-year-old metabolic health is not what it was in its 20s but yet still quote unquote healthy for me the goal is to be as youthful as possible metabolically in all of the organs as possible for as long as possible so i don't want to have you know a 92 average and be quote unquote 10 years better relative to my chronological age i want it to be at my best so what will that translate into in terms of lifespan who knows but i if you know if you fast forward and say okay now i've done this for 60 years and my average glucose is 90 for 60 years versus my rate of change has gone to the point where now my average glucose is 105 i mean i i'm going to take the bet where having a better metabolic health just using this as an example but kidneys to liver all of that trying to keep the data as youthful as possible as naturally as possible not artificially induced will give me my best bet of not just health span but also potentially lifespan it's very difficult to quantify you know um because there aren't any real studies we're looking at extrapolation based on curves but for me it's more of the philosophy of you know that rate of change is bad because rate of change whether too high or too low is truly aging you're aging now you could say even though that's within some quote unquote healthy range it's still aging now if you've been able to keep it from aging and resist that age- related increase or decrease you've that's that's a win right or if you've reversed it where for example my rdw was you know somewhere around 13 and i've flipped it down to 12 which is pretty close to optimal now can i maintain that for the next 70 years right so how much of a lifespan you know and and two it's also it's not just about one biomarker because you know maybe you're right maybe it's just a one or two% uh relative change in terms of all cause mortality risk but now multiply that by 20 biomarkers or 10 biomarkers rep representative of all organ systems is that another 10 years of life 30 years of life 30 nobody knows right so that's the conquer aging or d trying bet well that's the then we ri get back to the argument that you made before like what if someone is already an elite ath aete um let's say that they're an elite athlete who also walks 12,000 steps a day okay so is then um watching their glucose to try and get it from 96 down to 92 going to be a worthwhile effort for them and give them a material gain i don't think so so that's up to the individual i mean we all know the bet we all know the bed that i'm laying on it's not just about glucose it's about and and and also you know when you consider that you know um you know we all know that elite athletes live longer than the average population but it's only five to seven years and you know the goal my goal is to break the human longevity record 122 so you know what's the dose what's the dose of exercise what's the dose of all of it you know you it's got to be more than just eat real food and exercise because even the most well-intentioned people in this in this space jacan died at 95 and he was talking about immortality forever and he was fit and functional forever you know there's got to be a higher level to this right you could even take it a step further right so what i'm doing is very um the basics of it you know i'm looking at these markers of organ and systemic health but then you can even titrate it down under the hood right so if you take if you take body composition and uh physical and cognitive function as a top tier right now we're back into tiers and you subdivide that there's a there's a whole bunch of stuff under that hood right so sure i've proposed to take it a step further um you know looking at cells and the proteins and even metabolites creatinine as one example but then can go even further than that you know it's not just you know glucose and creatinine are are metabolites you know our blood has like 4,000 metabolites that circulate so even though i'm doing the metabolomics um you know and that's about 600 metabolites you know ideally and i'm still subdividing that only into a handful of metabolites that i'm currently tracking you know eventually we'll get to the point where we're looking at entropy change from a healthy state you know so now it isn't just a panel of 25 to 30 or 40 biomarkers however much i'm using now to quote unquote define youth and health we have you know thousands of of markers that are representative of youthful state and then we'll have your current data to show how far is your has your you know has your quotequote healthy state deviated from that and then what can you do to get your full metabolism back to your healthy state or as much as possible so someone someone that's chronologically 60 maybe they can get back to the physiology and biochemistry of a 30-year-old that's the best they can do right so um for me it's a data driven process to try to enhance youth and and and everything else so but if people don't want to choose that and just want to go eat real food and exercise you know i'm not here to be a fascist and say it has to be my way i mean those who want to follow will follow and those who don't i mean that's their choice too yeah we need uh get back to my my argument before we need more more mics out there doing the data to give us um so we can go from a specific example to get a better few for because i don't i don't think we're going to well i mean i think we will get there um as far as real longevity extension beyond 100 years old um that's the holy grail at this point and um honestly my walking and exercise is not going to get me there i'm not sure with the biomarkers on there i hope that you get to laugh at me sometime when you find out the biomarkers actually have completely uh conquered dying and uh conquered aging and you live forever but i mean the the thing is in this this segways well into the next point if coming to the new biomarkers right like nowadays they talk about uh the methylation biomarkers right so that's it's kind of a more advanced thing where they're talking about the activation of the genes but uh the most recent evaluation of and this is a white p uh this is still a pre uh peer review it's not been published and this is made by the people who um basically the researchers who came with a d dun dunad in pace uh methylation marker which you do um um i think you had about eight 0.8 uh pace of aging mine was also comparable uh we have a lot of the similar habits um but the the thing that uh is i'm not expecting people to read through all of this but what i found to be fascinating about this is they look to see okay what what can we show what interventions are shown to improve your epigenetics and show that you've reduced the speed of aging and startlingly you can see the vast majority of them don't have any effect at all and right in the middle of this they say that both diet and exercise have no effect on your dna markers right like forget walking 12,000 steps they just say flat out diet and exercise interventions had no impact on dunad in pace right so it's a great smack dab in the middle of it is one line both exercise and diet uh not shown to have any significant effect either way so all right i saw that i saw this pre-print i'm not surprised um in my data calories don't currently uh aren't significally correlated with dun and pace um so when you think about when you go all the way down in terms of the the the levels right so from that top down again body composition and physical cognitive function um you could even say bone you know bone is a part of body composition if you go all the way down you've got genomics can't change our genetics currently you go above that now we're at epigenetics which is one aspect of epigenetic modifications is methylation which is what they're measuring you know you can also ayate genes uh to turn them monor off so methylation is just one snapshot of that right so for those who don't know dedan pace is uh not the best for asking the question how old are you what is your epigenetic age there are other tests like the horvath test which is the gold standard for that uh but it it is significantly associated an older denan pace a faster speed of epigenetic aging with an increased all cause mortality risk and in the same ballpark as other gold standard clocks like uh uh pheno agage the epigenetic phenoage test not the blood biomarker based test so in as short short story long story short is that when you take the clinical biomarkers for lavine's phenoage and then you develop an epigenetic prediction of who's younger who's older and who's in the middle that's the dna methylation version of that and then grimage which is another gold standard clock consistently associated with an increased all ca c mortality risk so den and pace is in the same ballpark for the effect size in terms of all cause mortality risk which highlights it as a strong uh uh um you know clock for measuring speed of aging and then one reason why it's uh you know i've talked about as it being potentially important these other gold standard clocks like horvath pheno agage and grimage when you look at people on a calor restricted diet only done and pace for people on cr it was 12% cr they weren't overweight to start they were at that borderline of a bmi of around 25 and two-year randomized control trial donan pace was the only epigenetic clock able to identify slower speed of aging relative to the other gold standard clock so that highlights that it's potentially important now in terms of this study it it the the subject cohort means a lot are you looking at people who for example uh you know art therapy or kidney dialysis you know do do interventions whether it's diet exercise in this paper also looked at things like which i think didn't wasn't associated with slowing of epigenetic aging either i think the subject getting the subject population is important for example are you 80 years old and you're taking rapy what's your epigenetic age i don't know i i haven't looked i don't know if that's included in this in this group of 51 studies uh i'd expect that maybe that would would be where rap ayin as an example would have the greatest effect for people who have uh you know whatever pre pre-existing condition rapy could be help help helpful now if you have a elite have an elite athlete and they're taking rapidy would you see a reduction in epigenetic aging i don't think that's in this study either right so the subject population is important and i think a lot of these cohorts are aren't exactly the fittest or healthiest now this aside it also goes back to we can do this experiment on our own right you know we can try to find if calories or some magnitude of exercise is associated with a slower denan pace and for me like i said calories aren't associated right now and that's after um 17 tests oh personally okay from your own test huh yeah now but then it gets to the question of knowing that the dna methylation based test for pheno ag is a prediction of phenoage which includes the standard clinical chemistry biomarkers alumin alp etc for me it makes sense i want the actual data i don't want i don't want the epigenetic prediction of that but that said i'm still a big fan of the epigenetics don't get me wrong uh i love hannah and and ryan you know the the the heads of of true diagnostic they're great they're fantastic i love them in the field they're great i'm not trying to knock them at all um but what biomarkers then is don and pace based on and you know because it's an epigenetic prediction of those biomarkers so it includes 19 and those biomarkers include things like v2 max wayte to hipo um gum health so oral health is a part of that ail b apil a1 hba1c h hscrp these are all things that we can optimize towards youth and health without having the epigenetics now then it gets to the what aspect of which aspects of diet can optimize the things that can be optimized on that list and which things can't so that's where i'm currently at with that and looking at weak spots to try to make further gains in den and pace for example my lipoprotein a has always been towards the higher end of the reference range so i've been recently doing some experiments to try to bring my lipoprotein a down which is thought to be genetically resistant to intervention but in my data that's also not true i've been able to cut it in half by at most uh so anyway that's where i'm currently on on that but even there you know um there may be some epigenetic pace of aging using dunen pace where you get to a low level and you're not able to go consistently below that for example maybe 08 is the best that i can do based on my genetics whereas others may be able to get it to 6 and they're genetically able to have a slower pace of aging uh so anyway long story short is that we can with even without testing done need and pace on your own that list of 19 biomarkers we can measure those things even just leanness and a high vo2 max and good you know metabolic health which are heavily dominant on that 19 biomarker list optimizing that can go a long way towards you know potentially improving someone's health and even slowing the pace of aging so on that no let let's uh let's go back to what you started with here um i haven't looked at this uh too much i've recognized the rat chart i think that we just saw recently but uh tell us tell me about this is this your data i wanted to know where it came from yeah so let me uh share screen here because i gotta maybe u make it yeah yeah yeah [music] um i don't know if this is easier to see but uh make it bigger all right so this gets to the question of uh what magnitude of cr is cr potentially beneficial and again note for those who don't know my bmi is currently 22 current calorie intake is around 2130 uh my ad lib intake since 2015 i've weighed all my food my highest intake uh that corresponds to any blood test 2800 so when you take my current average intake and divide it by my adlib intake that's around 22 23% cr i've tried to go lower than that some of my biomarkers get worse as we'll see in a minute but this idea of is cr better for biomarkers right so each of these circles uh is uh corresponds to calorie intake um and so each each each biomarker that corresponds to a calor intake so for example if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests because i'm tracking diet i take the average 50 days for calorie intake and then that lines up with the latter blood test i can do that for every blood test now it has an average calorie intake and i can look at correlations so for example dhea sulfate that's an androgen androgen decline during aging this is well known dhea included so lower dhea uh sulfate is going in the wrong direction it declining during aging is going in the wrong direction so here first dhe sulfate ploted verse dhe sulfate ais plotted against calorie intake in my data we can see a significant correlation where higher calories are significally correlated with lower dhea sulfate so i've labeled that red it's going in the wrong direction this would argue that higher calories is potentially bad for mechanisms that impact my production of the ha sulfate hscp i don't have to go through that you know it's higher higher obviously bad higher calorie intake is significantly posit positively correlated with higher hscrp higher nutrifil and monocytes which increase during aging and higher levels associated with an increase all cause mortality risk higher calories there too going in the wrong direction ldl so you can make the argument here a couple of ways ldl follows an inverse you during aging low in youth peak at midlife and low towards the end of life so if your data is low is it youthful or aged in my data ldl being higher tracks with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so higher l may be more reflective of the middle-aged data relative to the youthful data in my case and that's a story i can i can go further in depth on in terms of how do you know if your data is middle-aged versus aged but that's a story for another day here higher calories significant correlated with higher ldl going in the wrong direction platelets greater than 300 uh actually is u-shaped for platelets so too low less than 200 too high greater than 300 increased all cause mortality risk so uh in my data higher calories is associated with significantly associated these are p values less than 0.05 in a panel of about 25 standard clinical chemistry biomarkers um so higher platelets now you could make the argument that platelets decline during aging so this is resisting an age related decline but when considering that higher than 300 is going in the wrong direction and less than 200 is going in the wrong direction should i be closer to 200 or closer to 300 the story is similar to ldl for me where lower maybe better but even still we can we can we can leave this aside for now rdw just to i i already showed that but higher is worse right higher calorie intake significantly higher is significantly correlated with higher rdw same similarly for uric acid uric acid increases during aging higher levels increase all cause mortality risk and that same story for systolic blood pressure so we've got you know two four uh you know six8 what do we got uh ah and then we've got two more that were at the top of the list here alkaline phosphotase values higher than 48 or associated with an increased all cause mortality risk it may not increase during aging there isn't solid data for that and you can see that above 50 that or 48 you can see higher calories and the correlation is significant so that too going in the wrong direction and also hdl higher calories significantly correlated with lower hdl so i've got you know 10 biomarkers representative of many organ systems that are going in the wrong direction at a higher calorie intake and it isn't just you know at the highest calorie intakes you can see i have a spread of data that goes from around 2100 to 2,800 now there's one exception to this and i only looked at significant correlations anything with a p value greater than 0.05 i didn't look at so higher calories is significantly correlated with higher lymphocytes and that's important because as i showed earlier lymphocytes decline during aging and values less than 2,000 as they go below that are significally associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so this suggests that there's a calorie amount that may be optimal for lymphocytes but may be bad for 10 other biomarkers so it gets to the question of what you know and we're considering that lymphocytes at least in the mous study was one of the biomarkers that was associated with longevity regardless of the mice were adlib fasted or on cr it then goes to the question of what magnitude of calorie intake and cr may optimize lymphocytes while not messing up the other biomarkers and for me that's not my lowest calorie intakes at 2080 i'm just a bit above above that right now 2130 and in support of that i've had two tests in a row where lymphocytes were closer to 1900 whereas for the tests that were at my lowest calorie intakes they were below 1,600 for the first time in nine years uh but it gets to that idea of how do you titrate the dose of calorie restriction um and using the b markers at least in my case i've got a multitude of biomarkers that are quote unquote more youthful and healthy looking relative to higher calorie intakes um first of all i gotta i gotta applaud the data i mean i can't i love it um that's some i like to have all those things and be going down and the the p factor for each of them is very impressive yeah so you come you come with you you came with gloves and i come with gloves and kicks and jiu-jitsu and i got i got all the skills in the toolbox but i ain't done yet okay great cool because if you look those numbers though the overall range that you've got there i mean yes i can see when i when you look at it that there's a there's a tilt to the line and as you say it's it's clearly showing that okay if you lose weight or if you're at a lower calorie restriction then you're going to be going towards the positive side of it but i think all of those lines are fine for you in all ways mike they're all going to be within the like you're already within the accepted range for all of them aren't you are any of those actually borderline to danger no but when considering that they all changeed during aging it's basically you know it then i think the next question is actually will the lower calorie intakes actually slow the rate at which those things change during aging right and if that's the case then i'm on to something so for and you could say too like okay uh would 5% cr make it all right so fine you're within the quotee unquote reference range but using the epi studies there are optimal ranges that are associated with lowest all cause mortality risk there are values that are more likely to be found in youth and based on all of those plots my current magnitude of cr around 20 something percent low 20s puts me on a road closer to youth and lowest all cause mortality risk now how much of a lifespan or health span gain will i get i don't know have i actually slowed the rate and pace of aging if we look at just morgan lavine's feno age uh and i covered this in one of my most recent videos blood test number 7 uh where feno ag if all biomarkers stay the same you should have an you'll have an increase by 0.9 years per year of chronological age so in other words starting four years ago my biological age using that metric and again well i'll go that through that in a minute but 35.6 in 2020 okay so same biomarkers if the markers don't change four years later i should expect it to be 3.6 years older based on based on just the metric so should be uh you know 35.6 plus 3.6 39.2 2024 current data is 34.8 so you could say i've resisted the age related change i've slowed some rate of aging at least based on those nine biomarkers there their rate of aging over the past four years is slower than expected based on chronological ages so will that translate into 51 nobody knows this is the bet i'm making you know and i'm happy for people to criticize and say there's no published data i don't i don't believe what you're doing fine don't don't make your bet maybe i look you know so maybe i've got so my dad's brother died at 51 he had a stroke of 47 my dad's father died at 67 uh heart disease uh my mom's father 67 heart disease my mom's brother 67 bunch of stuff kidney failure everything the whole gamut so if if i don't try to do what you know the matt damon line and the martian if i'm going to get out of this i'm gna have to science out of aging if i don't try to take every bit of it i may maybe my genetics are dead by 80 even with the best well-intentioned biomarker and everything analysis i i'm not going to be mad at that right maybe i push my lifespan longer than i would have naturally i squeezed the orange as much as possible but then maybe just like bernie sanders says maybe but just maybe i can really push this thing out right maybe i can discover continuously discover the recipe to keep my physiology and biochemistry as youthful as possible for as long as possible and then i'm name dropping like crazy using the cur curs while live long enough to live forever when real rejuvenation tech will come will that be in the next 70 years will it be in the next 500 i don't know i'm i'm i'm playing the same game on that one i think that uh we need to have we need to have the glp1 of longevity so something that comes in and gives us sort of breaks it because it uh all the interventions we have now as we've talked about they're usually based off of people who are not healthy and what they're able to offer someone who's already living a healthy life isn't uh isn't enough so go ahead gp1 go so glp1 uh which is a satiety inducing hormone uh and this isn't the only way so for the people who hear me say this don't sa ah tomato tomato right sey right you know maybe anyway so uh uh for the people who i'm not trying to say this is the only way there are a few ways we can activate glp1 without things like oic and one way is a high soluble fiber diet soluble fiber produces the gut bacter gut certain gut bacteria produce short chain fatty acids from fiber fermentation and those short chain fatty acids activate glp1 production so now then you could say well does fiber lead to a longer lifespan no animal studies and they you know there are no animal studies that have used a high soluble fiber diet um and you know what about in human data right well most people barely get 20 grams of fiber let alone five grams of soluble fiber we may need 20 or 30 grams of soluble fiber is it supplemental soluble fiber do i need to get it from vegetables legumes or other stuff right so there's a whole bunch of questions there so this is one reason why and and fortunately the biomarkers seem to support this more often than not but there is an upper limit here where my very high fiber diet of about 85 grams per day about 20 of that being soluble is a part of the overall approach for these mostly youthful biomarkers with some weak spots now will that also help push you know past the nobody knows there's no data right so have you uh you don't you don't um supplement fiber right i mean your diet is right same here by the way i mean i get my my breakfast of whole grains and then on top of that the legumes and uh then some fruits and vegetables um but i know several of the other people who do recommend straight supplementation of it the the issue there is um for whatever reason there are animal studies and at least one human study that i know of where very high dose supplemental uh soluble fiber for example inulin can induce liver cell damage liver damage leading to higher alt or in the blood in one human study rct there were uh with 30 grams of inulin per day that's 30 grams of soluble fiber per day i mean that's more than i get whole food it's a lot um but the effect wasn't in all study participants three of the 18 people getting high dose inulin the elevations and liver enzymes so they they had to stop taking right so but there too it gets the biomarkers you'd have to actually measure uh and see if that's making uh you know making a dent like that right so there is an upper limit you know but yeah let me let me by the way i i want to be careful and say that um we've talked about uh the biomarkers and the utility of them i want to be absolutely clear that there's huge benefit if your if your glucose level is far out of the range or treatment for it or your blood pressure and these other things um oftentimes you and i are sort of talking about tweaking at the the the fine zone right um and i'm not sure if that's useful but if you have high glucose or insulin uh is or diabetes other things extremely useful to get the biomarkers and absolutely should be acted upon um so uh i think that it's when we start to overtune and think that uh we're able to then add additional life uh out of trying to take it down a few numbers or so even though it's already within the normal range i think that's the questionable part so i just wanted to make sure that listen to your doc of course yeah so so to add something to that right so imagine your h hb1c is 5.7 uh 5.8 now we start to get into the pre-diabetic range now let's say you went to your doctor your doctor says you're pre-diabetic uh you know we're going to give you some metformin or some drug right but as a part of that process is going to be regular monitoring to see what that reduces your hba1 c2 right so regular monitoring is a big part of this approach then it gets to the question of what should my hba1c be and then it also raises the question of just like in the gym how can i expect to improve my strength or performance if i'm not actively trying to make it better so if i'm not measuring my hb1c and trying to keep it as youthful as possible you know will it go in the age related change range and then i'm going to be stuck having to take metformin or some other drug that may lose efficacy for years and decades of taking it whereas if you've been trying to discover your own personal motorcycle recipe uh maybe that's the best approach for keeping it relatively youthful and resisting age related change but the only way to know that is by regular and repeated testing over a very long period of time so we can minimize that risk of getting to an advanced age and now it's like well what do i do now even at that stage you're still going to have to start on that many te many test measurements so all i'm promoting is that let's let's measure now let's measure now let's discover recipes now and wait along those lines too eventually we're going to get to the point where whether it's in our toilets or finger prick or urinary however it may be we're all going to have it where you know we'll have a person personalized health and exercise and sleep prescription based on our genetics based on diet based on air quality based on all the things for a recommended you know input you know inputs per day that could potentially optimize our health and lifespan we'll have day-to-day integration maybe even meal-to-meal integration now the question is when how long will that take right so right well uh as you talk about uh then you find out that you need to take the habits uh can i jump into the update on the unaging challenge okay yes so how so how how did how does your how did your fight go how how do you think that went was it what you expected uh yeah absolutely hold on a second here let me um oh that's uh my data uh yes i'm gonna i me it's a slideshow i'll get so uh uh first of all thanks i mean as i said i think we agree on most things and so it's fun to sort of pick on the things where i don't think we do agree yeah um uh yeah you brought in some some late breaking news there i wasn't able to quite roll with that um so uh you know i'll have to take a look at that uh we might have to have a rematch or something to talk about that but uh i think fundamentally your answers are right in that we don't really know and um what we do know is that neither of us have a magic pill that's guaranteed at this point so uh i appreciate your experimentation i'm sure i think it's um in my opinion it would be uh sort of um fine-tuning on the margins um i think that there are better things and the better way that you could get the habits are the bigger drivers and i know that you're a believer in those habits as well you live an exemplary life as far as your weekly workouts your diet and everything else so i wouldn't take away uh any of that part i would say that i think you could shift your focus i don't know what are thoughts on our no no sorry sorry i i always have i always have something to say right my daughter's like you always have something to say uh so just as an example to that if if i only focused on the habits uh would my biomarkers be what they are now and the fact is that's not the case you know when i first started on this journey in 2015 my liver enzymes were in the high 30s now based on all cause mortality risk there too there's a u-shaped association where two low increased risk low 20s a alt lowest risk and once you go above 22 or so increased risk my data was in the high 30s so now i'm not wasn't an alcohol drinker um you know which would be the obvious you know what's going on there but it was my diet composition isn't what it is now and it's only what it is now because i've been titrating over time to try to figure out the recipe to bring those liver enzymes down into the low 20s where they now currently are so wow for whatever reason in my case too much omega 6 may have been part of that story i was and this isn't from seed oils this is from walnuts and and and probably other nuts that i was eating at the time i may have a specific range where if i go above a certain amount for certain nutrients it may induce liver damage it may have been a fructose story where i was eating about twice as much fruit as i do now and you've seen the strawberries i mean i was eating double that half a kilo one pound of strawberries a day yep well back then it was you know strawberries and blueberries and blackberries so it was double the intake then so that made been you know a contributor because high fructose fructose is metabolized by the liver so you could say you know it's a whole food based diet you're you know there are no published studies that show increased mortality risk with increased fruit intake right so if i did nothing i would have seen this unchecked maybe for the past 10 years maybe putting me at an increased risk for a liver disease uh so this is that would be the argument where you know don't assume that your diet and following the habits is the best approach the only way to know is by looking at the biomarkers and objective tracking and but then once you start tracking it's like okay where are my weak spots and what can actually improve it right so um come on come on mike i'm taking off the gloves keep on swinging man all right all right no more swinging i i'll take i'll take yeah look someone someone eventually you know i'm looking all the time for someone eventually will beat my approach right you know the the the ter schwarzenegger eventually got you know there was an upgraded version of of the terminator right in the terminator movies right so you know there's only so long that i can do this before someone or some you know groups of people come along and beat this approach i'm trying to cover every base i'm very competitive you know i try to cover every base but someone will find weakness and be better and if i die trying well then hopefully the field can move forward and you know for example just another quick example one reason i developed this whole approach was seeing jackae and being humongous fan obviously but i was like there's got to be a better way even when he was saying eat real food and exercise i was like there's got to be a higher level and when he died especially i was like there's got to be a higher level so what is a higher level someone is going to come along and and look at my stuff and be like rudimentary basic this is the higher level from what l garden was doing so and i look forward i want to learn from people like that so right so um when i talked before about the the tears of longevity um um and i think um well you have some questions about the walking i think we're agreed that the strength training the aerobic and the high-intensity interval are key so one of the things that i found uh as i was um writing my blog and talking to people and uh hoping to make an impact on their health and longevity is that um i got kind of a lot of understanding of it and yes it seems like a good idea but um i didn't really feel like people were actually doing that many of the things so i've started the unaging challenge as i've talked about before for on your blog uh post uh on your podcast and other places and at the moment we have 20 people who are currently going through the strength training section of it and uh moving on to the third challenge so the unaging challenge is four separate challenges over the period of year and each of them focuses on a different aspect of your health we start out with the aerobic and high-intensity interval training then go into the strength training then go into mobility and walking and then the fourth challenge then is the personal peak where you make it your own so we're having a a really great time um the one of the big things about it is it's done as a community so it's not just a you do this by yourself there's uh shared information and shared chat and other things so you can sort of hear how it's going for other people and doing it as a challenge and it's measured because you need to have measurement of course right so how much you've lifted what's your one rep max your v2 max impact and other things so that you can track it over the period of the challenge so the 20 early adopters um this is their many paths to strength so this is basically the effectively total amount that they were able to lift in their calculated one repetition maximum based off of what they did and you can see that there's a whole b different uh ways of uh pa here as people went over the 12we challenge of it it uh becomes a little cleaner if you look at it in terms of the people who were trained and the people who are un trained uh i was lifting before i started this so i'm on the blue line um in general the people who had already come into the unaging challenge strength challenge having lifted before still were able to gain about 10% um through the unaging challenge system for the newbies they got to enjoy the beginner gains and uh they were able to increase about 40% or so over the the time let me see if i'm reading that correctly uh actually even more than that around 60% naturally some of that of them is just getting familiar with how you do the lift when you come in for the first time obviously you're not going to be attempting to do your maximum lift when you're just getting used to how you move the dumbbell around or or do the exercises so uh we almost have a 100 people uh registered for the 2025 challenge and uh if anyone is interested we still have open registration it is completely free i believe this kind of information should be available to everyone um while unfortunately i can't clone mike loose garten to duplicate his data we can get together and work together on the unaging challenge so the data is tracked uh for example uh the 20 people during the strength challenge the total amount that they lifted is over 1.5 million tons which uh is the weight of a jumbo jet so this is a an artistic representation of the 20 early adopters and what we're able to achieve during that time so if you're interested in more information um you can transform yourself the challenge starts on january 6th um and we'll be putting you into a group with other people um it's just a way of spreadsheet so that you can see sort of what they've done and they'll be able to see what you can do and also uh encourage each other through the challenge and you can find that at un aging.com uh and then under the the challenge you can do registration for that and then we'll take it from there so i don't know any any comments or or questions on the the unaging challenge yeah no that was great i was gna you know give you a shout out and promote unaging domcom and the unaging challenge but you did a great job of uh promoting it so hopefully people if they're interested will check it out sign up be a part of it so trying to move the world okay all right uh anything else we should cover before yeah i guess we'll talk about the aliens next time so much to talk about yeah all right cool ciao chris all right great thank you very much for the chance to talk
