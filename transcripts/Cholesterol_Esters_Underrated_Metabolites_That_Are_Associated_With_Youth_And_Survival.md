# Cholesterol Esters: Underrated Metabolites That Are Associated With Youth And Survival

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Cholesterol-derived metabolites are impacted by aging for example cholesterol is converted into steroid hormones which decline during aging conversely cholesterol is also converted into bile acids which increase during aging but steroids and bile acids aren't the only metabolites that are derived from cholesterol and in today's video we'll take a look at cholesterol esters so what are cholesterol esters in the presence of fatty acid 22 6 which is a fatty acid that has 22 carbons and six double bonds this is also known as the fish oil fatty acid dha and when that's bound to coenzyme a so when that's dha is activated in the presence of the acap protein which is acyl coa cholesterol acyl transferase we have a cholesterol ester as shown here we can see cholesterol on one side bound to dha so this is the dha cholesterol ester so why are cholesterol esters important in today's video we'll take a look at how levels of cholesterol esters change during aging which cholesterol esters are related to health which cholesterol esters are indicative of youth or an older epigenetic age and can we track and optimize cholesterol esters so first let's take a look at age-related ages and that's what we'll see here on the x-axis we've got the difference in lipid levels per year and in this case lipid levels are cholesterol esters or ce and on the other side of the y-axis we've got an age range going from 30 years old to older than 90 year olds i won't focus on the older the 90 year olds as that group is only seven people so this is a study of about 4 200 people from 30 to 89 years old and then we can see that cholesterol esters are relatively high at younger ages at least within the 30 to 59 year age range and comparatively are lower in 80 year olds or 80 to 89 year olds but there are many different fatty acids and correspondingly many different cholesterol esters so it may not be wise to look at all cholesterol esters as a group as some may increase during aging and some may decline during aging so so with that in mind how are specific cholesterol esters related to health and epigenetic aid so let's start off by taking a look at how specific cholesterol esters are related to health and to do that we'll look at associations between metabolites with all-cause mortality risk as shown here this study included more than 11 000 people with an average age of 54 years at baseline with a median follow-up time of 23 years and it included an analysis of 243 metabolites so starting at the baseline assessment for those metabolites how many people were alive or dead with a meaning and follow follow-up time of 23 years later and then which metabolites were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and a decreased risk for all-cause mortality and all-cause mortality risk is shown on the x-axis as the log hr that's the log of the hazard ratio to the right of zero we've got metabolites associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so higher levels of the metabolite are associated with an increased risk and then to the left of zero we've got higher levels of metabolites being associated with a decreased all-cause mortality risk now know that this is a cholesterol ester focus video but note that the metabolite that's significantly associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk is the amino acid serine and if you're familiar with the channel i've been supplementing with serine as a means to try to reduce homocysteine which then raises the question will supplementing with serine increase circulating levels as one potential strategy to potentially reduce all cause mortality risk so i currently have data for three tests this is using aiolo's at-home metabolomics kit was supplemented with two four and six grams of serine per day prior to the april may and july of 2023 tests so how did that impact plasma levels of serine but the first test at two grams per day we can see that plasma serine was about 170 micromolar and it didn't get an increase with 4 grams per day as plasma levels of serine went down to 110 micromolar now i don't know if that's normal variation of the test or just it wasn't that serine isn't able to increase plasma levels of serine serine supplementation isn't able to increase plasma levels of searing well the argument against plasma levels of serine increasing in response to supplementing is with six grams per day i got a very small increase to 175 micromolar which suggests that supplementing with serine may not increase circulating levels at least within the two to six gram per day range now i don't know if what my baseline syrian levels were yet without supplementation so i'll need that data to compare but at least at higher doses um that doesn't raise plasma levels of serine at least in my case all right so back to the cholesterol ester story where we can see that 22 6 dha cholesterol ester is associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk conversely the 16-1 so 16 carbons one double bond cholesterol ester is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so here we can see two different cholesterol esters are associated with all cause mortality risk in opposite directions which kind of supports the rationale to not look at cholesterol esters as one group especially in terms of aging related changes as they may have divergent effects on all cause mortality risk and maybe even epigenetic age which we'll take a look at in a minute so how are these cholesterol esters specifically ce161 and 22 6 related to epigenetic age and to assess epigenetic age we'll take a look at dna m so dna methylation or epigenetic age for using the pheno age test and the grimage test and the importance of these two epigenetic clocks is that they are a gold standard epigenetic clocks for their associations with all-cause mortality risk and if you missed that video i'll put it in the right corner all right so back to our question are those two cholesterol esters related to epigenetic age and for that we'll take a look at associations for epigenetic clocks these epigenetic clocks with cholesterol esters as shown here now we've got a bunch of blue and red dots on the screen so what does that what does that mean the red dots are for higher cholesterol ester levels that's associated with an older epigenetic age so red going in the wrong direction and then the blue dots which i would have labeled as green dots if it was my study just so you know that green is going in the right direction red light green light green higher cholesterol ester levels are associated with a younger epigenetic age all right so what about our two cholesterol esters 16 1 and 22 6. So starting with 16 1 we go to 16 carbons there and then one double bond and we can see that it has a red dot and that's for dna and pheno age what about for grim age so we can see exactly the same data so we've got replication not not just across epigenetic clocks but from the other study in terms of all cause mortality risk so we can see that these 16 1 cholesterol ester isn't just associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk it's also associated with an older epigenetic age so what about the 22 6 cholesterol ester dha cholesterol ester so we go to 22 carbons there then six double bonds and we can see it has a blue dot in other words the dha cholesterol ester is also associated with a younger epigen younger epigenetic age in addition to being associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk all right so there's a bunch of other blue and red dots on the screen so what are they we can see that 15 0 decreased all-cause mortality risk and similarly 17-0 are is associated with a decrease all cause mortality risk which then raised the question can we track cholesterol esters not just 16 1 and 22 6 but 15 0 17 0 and maybe others and also what's my data so first cholesterol esters can be tracked using an at-home metabolomic kit and that's the kit here that's the iolo kit and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me make videos using this kit for taurine and poly means which extend lifespan and rodents chinine and tryptophan as metabolites of the day novo nad synthesis pathway the fish oil fatty acids epa and dha which decline during aging and lower levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk metabolite ratios is an index of oxidative stress and in addition to these metabolites the kit has more than 500 metabolites including 22 cholesterol esters so if you're interested in the kit discount link in the video's description all right so it also of those 22 cholesterol esters many of them are younger associated cholesterol esters based on the phenoage and grimage data that i just showed and i have data for three tests and within those tests we can see that cholesterol s226 the dha cholesterol ester is in this younger associated cholesterol cholesterol ester group and then there are six others which then raises the question what's optimal well when considering that younger these cholesterol esters are associated with the younger epigenetic age i think it makes the most sense to avoid an age-related decrease for younger associated cholesterol esters in other words keep in other words keep them high because relatively higher levels are associated with a younger epigenetic age so how well am i doing at that so for the first test they were relatively high 259 micromolar as a sum of a group and i think it's valuable to look at not just one cholesterol ester but as a group especially a group that's going in the same direction as listed on this table so 259 micro molar for the first test but then it went in the wrong direction for the next 193 micromolar and then even worse for the third test 159 micromolars so this is data that's definitely going in the wrong direction now when the story gets interesting at least for me is for test number one my nad levels were 30 micromolar as i send blood to infinity on the day same day as this test now 30 micromolar is above my baseline of 20 to 25 micromolar but it isn't as high as for test number three where my nad levels were 59 micromolar as encouraged by nicotinic acid supplementation now when considering that my nad levels doubled above 30 in conjunction with that decline for younger associated younger epigenetic age associated cholesterol esters at least for this group that would maybe suggest additional evidence that going too high for nad may be bad for epigenetic age and i showed that story in two videos ago in terms of my dunedin pace looking like a crazy outlier at 0.98 in conjunction with having my nad levels on that day it's even higher 67 micromolar so in terms of what's optimal for nad that's a different a story for a different day a different video but 60 micro molar may be too high all right what about older associated cholesterol esters so the iola kit has two including the 16 1 cholesterol ester that i've talked about a lot in this video but also the 23 cholesterol ester and just like we did for the younger associated cholesterol esters what's optimal so for the older associated older epigenetic older epigenetic age-associated cholesterol esters i think it makes the most sense to avoid an age-related increase as relatively higher levels are associated with an older epigenetic age so how well am i doing at that and again this is very preliminary data it's only three tests i'm still gathering enough data because i don't know what my normal range for these cholesterol esters is i don't know what's correlated with it to try to push it towards the higher end of my range or the lower end of my range yet so i would i would take these data with a grain of salt but this is what the data is so far but the first test these two the sum of these two older associated cholesterol esters was 14 micromolar somehow it declined again whether that's normal variability or whether i did something in the diet or supplements reduced it i don't know yet went down to about seven micromolar and then back up to 14 micromolar so again for the older associated cholesterol esters the goal is to keep them relatively low all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics as a measurement of cholesterol esters and many other groups any de quantification epigenetic and telomere testing or microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with cyphox health as they include apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've got we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging
