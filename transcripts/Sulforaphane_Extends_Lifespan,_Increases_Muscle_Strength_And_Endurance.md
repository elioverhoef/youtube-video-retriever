# Sulforaphane Extends Lifespan, Increases Muscle Strength And Endurance

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

During aging levels of the transcription factor nrf2 or nerf 2 decline and that's potentially important because an age- related decline for nerf 2 impacts many hallmarks of aging which then impact many age associated diseases so can we reverse the age- related decline for nerf 2 expression and interestingly one uh dietary factor that may impact nerf to expression is sulfurane which is found in broccoli but to a larger extent in broccoli sprouts and we'll get into that data later in the video but first sulfurane increases nerf 2 expression which is what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got relative expression of nerf 2 plotted against the sulfurane sfn concentration at zero so none no sulfurane three and six micromolar and we can see that sulfurane at three and six micromolar increases nerve to expression almost twofold higher when compared with no suhane at all and that's potentially important because it suggests that it could increase nerf to expression potentially uh reducing or reducing the effect of the hallmarks of aging on age related diseases but more specifically can sulfurane impact lifespan and in fact sulfurane increases lifespan in ag mice and more specifically the age mice were 21 to 22 months old in terms of the lifespan that's what we'll see here with percent survival on the y- axis plotted against time in weeks on the x now for survival studies we usually look at 50% survival or median survival that's the red line there that's the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive they didn't evaluate that in this study they looked at 75% survival instead this is the time when 25% of the colony had died and 75% was still alive at that time point when starting with the control diet we can see that five of the 20 mice that they included for the lifespan an anis had died but in contrast for the sulfurane sfn containing diet and in terms of the content it was 442.50 mig of sulfurane for per kilogram food we can see that mice fed sulfurane all of them were still alive at that time point none of them had died you can see that green line is flat so no mice fed sulfurane had died whereas five mice on the control m uh control diet had died and rather than just looking at two groups of data and numbers we've got this statistics which this is a statistically significant difference for sulphoraphane increasing lifespan at least 25% survival now increasing lifespan is one thing but a common theme in the longevity space is are you living longer and healthier or just longer with more uh disease or poor health and frail so in this study they showed that sulfurane improves muscle strength and endurance in age mice which is what we'll see here and the first test they used was a wire hanging test so the mice are gripping onto the wire and how long that they're able to hold on is a measure of grip strength but also grip endurance so in terms of how long the mice are able to hold on they measure that in time and then we have two groups they actually looked at young in this case and old young being 2 months old and then again the old being 21 to 22 months old so first in the young mice supplementing them with sulfurane didn't impact grip hang time but we can see in the old mice that we fed flane they had a significant increase in the grip hang time which is again a measure of strength and endurance when compared with the non-supplemented mice with sulfurane all right so what about a more specific test of endurance so to test that they looked they ran mice on a treadmill with the data shown here now body weight can affect the ability of mice to run so to account for that they measured treadmill work so work equals force time distance the force in this case is body weight the distance is meters run on the treadmill so work equals body weight time meters run on the treadmill so again they looked at young and old and again we can see that sulfurane supplementation in the young mice didn't impact treadmill work but for old mice that were fed sulfurane it increased aerobic exercise capacity all right so that that brings us then to what's a potential human equivalent dose and and in order to address that question we've got to take a look at bro the answering the question for broccoli sprouts vers versus broccoli which is best for sulfurane content and as far as i know there's only one study that's done a head-to-head matchup which is shown here where they looked at sulfurane content in both broccoli and broccoli sprouts so first they looked at two different types of broccoli in both the fettes and the stems and if we take the a average between those four measurements it's somewhere in the and assuming an equal mix so we're assuming we're eating the whole broccoli not just the heads but the heads and the stems and an equal mix of that so based on that we'd expect about 93 mig of sulfurane per 100 g of broccoli but as i mentioned they also included broccoli sprouts in this study and we can see that broccoli sprouts have about 12 times more sulfurane when compared with broccoli now another question to ask is though uh how old were the broccoli sprouts and that's important because they bought broccoli and the broccoli sprouts from the market so how long is the food sitting on the shelf who knows right so so and that's potentially important because as we'll see age of the broccoli sprouts and how old the seeds are or how much you know the time from germination is important in terms of sulur fane content which is what we'll see here so germination time on the left with sulfur fan content on the right and i should say for these data i wasn't familiar with the uh this paper but shout out to lumbus or sky lt doin on youtube who was making a point about trigonelline content in seeds vers sprouts and pointed me to this paper on sulfurane seeds versus brs so thanks to uh lumus uh or your you know your handle sky lt do and i don't know if i'm saying that right but shout out thanks i appreciate you uh posting that in the comments so in going back to the study we can see that the highest level of sulfurane is actually in broccoli seeds you know with 3600 micrograms per gram of broccoli seed which then uh declines by about 12-fold to broccoli sprouts that are 5 days old after sprouting them so if you're eating eating fresh sprouts 5 days as soon as they're ready to be uh eaten after 5 days you're getting very low levels of sulfurane so it's important to eat broccoli sprouts that are somewhere between 5 and 11 days old as we can see that then sulfurane content starts to increase after day five up to about 1500 1500 micrograms per gram all right so what's the h or the human equivalent dose so we can calculate that and i'm going to use the study on the bottom because the you can see that the units are different on the bottom it's microgram per g whereas on the top it's milligrams per 100 gram they're not they're not identical in their units so on the bottom that 1,55 micrograms per gram is actually equal to 1 millgram per gram so in terms of the human equivalent dose we can calculate that as multiplying 442.50 milligrams of sulfurane per kilogram food aged mice eat about four gam of food per day which is is 04 kg and i know that because i just published our group just published a study in age mice so we measured food intake and it's about 4 gr of food per day or 04 kilg so multiplying 4 442.50 * 04 and then dividing that by the body surface area conversion for mice to humans of 12.3 we get a human equivalent dose based on the animal study that extended 25% survival of 144 milligrams of sulfurane per day now i prefer to get it from whole foods as the start so in considering the study on the bottom the lopez cantes study 1 milligram around 1 milligram of sulfurane per gram of broccoli sprouts would yield about 140 gam of broccoli sprouts to get about 144 milligrams of sulfurane per day so that'll be in the approach until the next blood test i've got to work my my way up to 144 grams uh as i just started sprouting them so uh i started off with 60 a batch ded so now i'm regrowing them and i'm gna have to grow a lot more and reduce alala sprout intake but i'm excited to get started on the suur sulfurane experiment especially for things like tary length as as sulfurane again increases expression of nerf 2 which is well known to increase antioxidant defense enzymes and oxidative stress can limit tm length so it's possible that by including broccoli sprouts i may get an extension of tiir length or at least the dna methylation estimation of t length that i've been using with true true diagnostic all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my
