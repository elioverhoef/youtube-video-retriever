# It's Time To Science The Sh** Out Of DunedinPACE

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The and pace may be the best epigenetic clock for predicting the speed of epigenetic aging and one reason for that is shown here this was a 2-year study where people were calorie restricted by 12% and that's in comparison with people who were ad lib who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted so on the y- axis we've got the change in d and pace this is the change in the epigenetic pace of aging as measured by dun and pace and then there were three time points on the x axis baseline 12 and 24 months after starting the intervention so for people who were 12% calor restricted for 2 years they had a significantly slower epigenetic pace of aging as indicated by dun and pace were compared with the group who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted now that's a potentially important finding because other gold standard epigenetic clocks including horvath pheno ag and grim age were not able to detect a slower epigenetic pace of aging for people that were calorie restricted for 2 years which suggests that dun and p may be a more sensitive metric for being able to detect those changes so with that in mind what's my data to find out i sent blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own done and paste and other epigenetic tests discount link in the video's description so the most recent test that i have data for was on september 6 takes about a month to get the results and this is test number six in 2024 so on that day the need and pace was 0.88 what does that mean so the slowest epigenetic aging rate would be 0.6 and the fastest epigenetic aging rate would be 1.4 so 0.88 is far from terrible but i've got some room for improvement to get to that slowest epigenetic aging rate as the name of the channel is conquer aging or die trying not do a little bit better than you know chronological age in terms of slowing the epigenetic pace of aging now note that this is just one test and it's important to not get too high or too low about one test so with that in mind i test year-to-year changes with the goal of at worst slowing uh you know flatlining biomarkers so they're not age related increase or age related decrease keeping them constant at worst at best moving them closer towards youth so with that in mind what's my data over 17 tests as i've been tracking d and pace since 2022 and that's what we'll see here with d need and pace values on the y- axis plotted against collection date or time on the x so in 22 over three tests average st a pace was 0.84 and then thinking that three tests over a full year period may not be enough to track year-to-year changes or to get a full year average with only three tests i tested more often in 2023 8 times and over those eight tests dita pace was 0.80 now that's better and moving in the right direction but whether that's a closer representation of my full year average or whether i did stuff that actively decreased increased my epigenetic p pace of aging by a relatively small amount i'm not sure probably a little bit of both all right so what about in 2024 so over six tests average studing a pace is 0.84 which includes the most recent test of 0.88 which is back to where i started unfortunately in 2022 0.84 not as good as in 2023 so at worst when considering all 17 tests we can see that denita pace is mostly stable with an average the a pace of 0.82 now there may be a weakness in the these data and that's because two of the last three tests have been worse than average 0.91 and 0.88 on that last test and that's potentially important because d and pace increases during aging and that's what we'll see here with the need and pace values on the y- axis plotted against chronological age on the x and in terms of that age related increase we can see it indicated by the red line in other words for people of older chronological ages it's less likely to see a relatively younger denan pace in contrast for people in their 20s it's more likely to see relatively low ded and pace values say 6 relative to someone of an older chronological age so with that in mind that's one reason that the rejuvenation olympics leaderboard which is based on don and pace is likely to be dominated by people at the top of the list who are in their early 20s relative to older age groups also on this plot we can see my ro most recent data with that green circle highlighted by the red rectangle which is pretty close to average for my chronological age which again is like a a dirty word to me you know having age expected values so with that in mind the goal is to get it obviously to 0.6 would be which would be great for my chronological age but also great for any chronological age so with that in mind how can i improve d need and pace so for that let's take a look at 17 test correlations for diet with dun and pace and following each test i calculate correlations so after this test i calculated correlations for 99 foods macro and micronutrients with d and paast over those 17 tests with the top portion of the list shown here and if you're interested and seeing the full list of correlations that's on the correlations tier on patreon now before going into the data what's the approach how am i able to calculate correlations for diet or even supplements with biom markers and i i've covered that in many other videos the most recent in a video on to torine so if you miss that it'll be in the right corner all right so back to the list in terms of what's significant we go to the p value column and generally values less than 0.05 are statistically significant in this case we can see that not nothing on the list is less than 0.05 the closest uh metric or variable that's to to being less than 0.05 is fiber but that's actually in a direction opposite to what i would expect thinking that relatively higher fiber should be better for the epigenetic pace of aging so what do i do with this information even though fiber is not significant it's close so the fiber intake range over these 17 tests is 79 to 91 gram per day now when considering that fiber's correlation with don past is positive that suggests that when fiber has been towards the lower end of my range that's correlated notice i didn't say significantly correlated it's correlated with a lower den and paste and when my fiber intakes have been towards the higher end of that range 91 g per day that's correlated with an older or a faster uh don and pace so with that in mind for the next test test number 18 my average daily fiber intake since the september 6 test is 80 gram per day so if fiber has anything to do with don and past when considering that i'm following the correlation aiming for the lower end of my fiber intake range i should expect to see a slower ep genetic pace of aging but the obvious weakness in that approach is that fiber is not significantly associated or correlated with the and pace so with that in mind as you saw in the title of this video it's time to dig deeper so which biomarkers is the and pace based on and we can see the full list shown here the needen paste is an epigenetic approximation of 19 biomarkers all 19 that are shown here now this is new and i don't think many people have seen these data so i think it's important to walk through the 19 biomarkers so they include hba1c metabolic health they include measures of cardiovascular fitness so cardiorespiratory fitness is v2 max so this dun paste is an epigenetic approximation of people's v2 max that was one of the biomarkers that was included in this uh uh metric it also includes lung function measures fv1 / the fvc and also f1 on its own and then blood pressure mean arterial pressure so if you're familiar with the channel i track lung function f1 blood pressure and although i've measured v2 max i'm going to start tracking that at some point in the future probably uh in 2025 late 2025 i i can't go into the why about that yet but uh if anybody's uh interested i can give some hints in the uh comments it also includes measures like bmi and waste to hip ratio so measures relative or related to body composition white blood cell tmal length two markers of kidney function uh gum health so oral health is a part of this epigenetic approximation white blood cell counts and then we've got measures related to lipoproteins and lipids so triglycerides total cholesterol hdl and then the april b00 to april a1 ratio now last but potentially not least is lipoprotein a and as we'll see lipoprotein a in my data has always been relatively high which may be a reason why i've yet to see values less than around 0.74 so let's take a look at that data first starting with is lipoprotein a correlated with d and paste as i have data for eight tests vena puncture with dun and pace finger prick on the same day and that's what we'll see here so this is dun and paast versus lipoprotein a again eight tests from may of 2022 through august of 2023 on the y- axis we've got den and pace and that's on the x we've got lipoprotein a now note that the lipoprotein a ref refence range is less than 75 n nanomolar so even for just these eight tests i'm higher than the reference range and that's almost always been the case lipoprotein a levels have been thought to be genetically predetermined and there's almost nothing that you know supposedly there's almost nothing that we can do to reduce them so i've always been on the relatively high side of that reference range just outside of it and in terms of all cause mortality risk it's not high enough to be uh associated with all cause mortality risk which is good news but i'd like to have it obviously lower when assuming that it's a part of the donan pace algorithm so in terms of the correlation we can see that it's close to relatively strong the correlation coefficient is 0.6 a strong correlation would be greater than 0.7 but the p value is just outside of significance at 0.11 for the correlation for denum pace with lipoprotein a now that doesn't mean that they're not uh significantly that means that they're not significantly correlated but but it's possible that they are significally correlated and that eight tests may not be enough to detect that as a significant correlation so with that in mind i'm going to continue well i'm going to add it back into the approach i stopped tracking it for a while i'm going to add it back into the approach and we'll see how this story plays out if lipoprotein a is significantly correlated with denum pace as i collect more data but when considering that lipoprotein a is a part of the denum pace algorithm can i reduce it now even just without going further just when considering that on this plot over these eight tests i have a lipoprotein a range from 80 to 100 uh nanomolar that 20 nanomolar range suggests that there's a recipe involved in keeping it relatively low or relatively higher in that range it's not exactly 80 animal for every test if it was that would argue that it literally is hard to change because maybe it is genetically predetermined so i do have a range discovering how to keep it towards the low end of my range is a part of the story or part of the fun or part of the challenge depending on how you look at it so in terms of answering the question can i reduce lipoprotein a the first starting point for me always is are any foods or nutrients significantly correlated and one food that is significantly correlated is cacao bean intake so i buy whole kabian grind them myself and make sort of a homemade chocolate by mixing it with medle dates so now we're about to see lipoprotein a data in correlation with cacao beans and this is in 24 tests from august of 2018 through august of 2023 and if you're interested in the full list because there are a few other foods or nutrients that are significally correlated with lipoprotein a the full list is on patreon all right so in terms of the correlation for lipoprotein a with cacao we'll see that here lipoprotein a values on the y- axis plotted against the average daily cocoa bean or cacao bean intake on the x and for those who may not know i've been tracking diet every day since 2015 using a food scale so these values are as close to acc accurate or as close to yeah accurate as as what one can get in terms of the correlation we can see that there is a significant inverse correlation for coco bean intake with lipoprotein a as the correlation coefficient is 0.42 and the p value is less than 0.05 at 0.04 in other words when coco bean intake has been relatively high that's been significantly correlated with relatively lower lipoprotein a values so with that in mind once i discover this correlation about 10 days ago i thought all right i'm going to test it so i've increased cocoa bean intake over the past 10 days to an average of 19 gam per day and i'm going to test again very soon so i'll have about four not about i'll have 14 days with about 20 gram of cocoa bean intake per day to test this correlation now i can already hear in the comments that 14 days may not be enough to make a dent on epigenetic changes or including d e and pace so with that in mind i'm going to keep cocoa bean intake high for at least the next next six weeks after that when i plan on retesting to see if this is you if coco bean intake can make a dent or not now in terms of the 20 g dose or 19 to 20 g dose what change or what value what what's the expected outcome on lipoprotein a so based on extrapolation of this plot right here 19 gram per day of cocoa beans would be correlated with a lipoprotein a of about 80 nanomolar towards the low end of my range all right how does 80 nanomer correlate with d and past now we go over to the left plot and there we could see that based on extrapolation of that correlation it may lead to a lipoprotein a value close to my lowest level of 0.74 now will it work will this story play out the way i hope i don't know but i'm retesting or testing on october 18th just a few days away it takes about a month for results to come in so expect an update sometimes to sometime towards mid november uh towards late november maybe even early december all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biw aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself while helping helping to support the channel including epigenetic testing ulta lab test which is where i get the majority of my
