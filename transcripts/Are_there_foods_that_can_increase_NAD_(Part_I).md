[music] nad decreases during aging why is that important and what can we do about it so first in looking at the simplified graph here on the left we can see uh activity or levels on the y axis plotted versus age and nad blue line activity decreases during age so why is that important well nad levels are involved in the health and functioning of virtually every organ system and tissue in the human body so how can we increase nad levels during aging well there are a variety of strategies have been that have been shown to work uh for example nad boosters such as uh nicotinamide riboside nicotinamide mononucleotide uh in terms of uh exercise exercise has been shown to raise nad levels and in terms of diet fasting and calorie restriction also increase nad levels but in terms of diet that doesn't really say what components within the diet can boost nad levels and two components epigenetic and corsetin have been shown to inhibit cd38 activity so cd38 is a nad ace which means that is a protein that degrades nad so uh cd38 levels are shown on the graph increase during age which is one explanation for why nad levels decrease during aging so just to have a look at the epigenin and quercetin cd38 data so we can see here on the y-axis cd38 activity plotted against the concentration of apigenin so as the epigenin concentration increases uh intracellular levels of cd38 activity decrease similar data is found for quercetin as the quercetin concentration increases cd38 activity inside cells decreases now that's an important because uh nad levels correspondingly increase and we can see that here for epigenin uh epigenin levels uh increase about 50 sorry nad levels increase about 50 in the presence of apigenin the white bars intracellular nad levels and uh a smaller but still significant increase for nad levels is found for uh quercetin um so uh where can we get foods or which foods have epigenetic and corsetine with the goal of maximizing uh intracellular nad levels so the most concentrated source of abigent is found in parsley and a half milligrams per 100 grams so to get that into my diet i add about 40 grams uh to a smoothie uh every other day now in terms of quercetin the two best sources of corsetin are found in dill 55 and a half milligrams per hundred grams and in red or purple onions uh so the to actually eat more dill than i do purple uh red or purple onions um so when i run out of pickles i'll take a bunch or a few bunches of dill and some jalapenos and and whatever spices are left in the in the pickle juice and i'll pickle the dill so when once it ferments after a couple days i'll then eat the pickled dill about 15 grams or more so i always favor whole foods over supplements so with this in mind it may be a good idea to include foods such as parsley dill purple onions and there are other foods if you want to look at other but less concentrated sources of epigenetic and carcinoma included the link that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
