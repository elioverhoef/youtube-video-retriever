Methionine restriction extends lifespan so let's have a look at that data first in male mice we're looking at survival plotted on the y-axis against lifespan or age in days on the x and then there were two groups controls which were fed a diet of 0.43 methionine and then methion restricted which were fed a diet of 0.15 methionine so a 65 reduction for dietary methionine intake in the restricted group and then when looking at median survival or 50 survival this is the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive and also maximum survival this or 10 survival this is the time when 90 of the colony had diet and only 10 percent was still alive we can see significant increases for both median and maximal survival in male mice similarly uh in female mice when looking at the same diets point four three percent methionine for the controls 0.15 methionine for the restricted group when looking at median and maximum survival we can again see significant increases in female mice for both median and maximal survival in the methionine restricted group so then one of the questions to address is how can methionine restriction extend lifespan so first is methionine restriction a form of calorie restriction are the restricted animals just eating less calories or less food less calories and correspondingly calorie restricted and then that's extending lifespan so let's investigate that so first let's have a look at body weight and notice that days goes up to 60 and this was a 60-day study in eight week old male mice and then we've got three methionine groups lomethionine 0.17 percent normal methionine which was defined in this study as 0.86 and then a high methionine group which was 2.58 and this study and all the studies referenced in this video will be in the video's description so if you're interested in those studies check it out then what we can see is that for both the normal and the high methionine groups when when compared with those two groups we can see that the low methionine group 0.17 percent had a significantly reduced body weight when compared with the higher methionine intake groups so that then raises the question was food intake reduced on the methionine restricted diet and that's we can see here food intake in grams eaten per day per mouse and then we've got the three different groups low normal and high lm nm and hm plotted on the x-axis and what we can see is that the low methionine group actually ate more food per mouse when compared with the higher methionine intake groups so food intake is significantly increased in methionine restricted mice and with that we can see that methionine restricted mice are not calorie restricted so then what might explain the extended lifespan in methionine restricted mice so first fecal and plasma short chain fatty acids or scfas are increased on a methionine restricted diet so what are these short chain fatty acids in terms of concentration the most abundant short chain fatty acids are acetate propionate and butyrate as shown there and as i've presented in an earlier video they're increased by a high soluble fiber diet or exercise training and if you missed that video i'll link to it in the right corner so what about data in methionine restricted mice so first we've got fecal levels of short chain fatty acids plotted on the y-axis and then we've got levels of each of these three short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate on the x and what we can see is that the low methionine intake group or the methionine restricted mice had significantly higher fecal levels of not only acetate but also propionate and butyrate were compared with the higher intakes of methionine and the other groups what about short chain fatty acid levels in blood on a methionine restricted diet and that's we can see here plasma levels of short chain fatty acids and we see similar data higher levels of significantly higher levels of acetate propionate and butyrate in mice on on a methionally restricted diet when compared with the higher methionine intake groups so now we can add to the list that fecal and plasma levels of short chain fatty acids aren't just increased as a result of a high soluble fiber diet or exercise training but also as a result of methionine restriction so how are short chain fatty acids related to lifespan extension so for that let's take a look at the acarbose a carbo study or eight carbos data and there we can see that a carbos extends lifespan so here we're looking at pool data from genetically heterogeneous mice and this is data from three different study sites that i mentioned was pulled and those three study sites were the university of texas health science center at san antonio the university of mission and the jackson laboratory so we're looking at median and maximum survival for both males on the left and females on the right we can see significantly increased median and maximal lifespan for both males and females that were supplemented with a carbos so what does that have to do with short chain fatty acids well fecal levels of short chain fatty acids are increased in a carbo supplemented mice and we can see that here so at the top we've got levels of the short chain fatty acids acetate butyrate and propionate and at the far right we've got total levels of these short chain fatty acids and then uh it's broken down to each of the three study sites so from left to right tjl is the jackson lab u of m is university of michigan and ut is a university of texas and what we can see is that fecal levels of acetate and butyrate were higher in eight carbos treated mice at the university of texas fecal levels of propionate or higher in a carbos traded in mice at all three study sites and then total levels of short chain fatty acids were higher significantly higher in the a-carbose supplemented mice at the university of texas so when considering that short chain fatty acids may be contributing or maybe a part of the longevity story in a carbo's traded mice collectively these data suggest the potential rule for short chain fatty acids on longevity in methionine restricted mice ii now short chain fatty acids aren't the only pathway that may impact lifespan in methionine restricted mice and methionine restriction also increases fgf21 which extends lifespan and we can see that here so before going into this story note that i've covered fgf21's impact on health in an earlier video and if you missed that it'll be in the right corner so now on to the data so in this study there were two groups tg which stands for transgenic and more specifically these were fgf21 transgenic mice so mice that were genetically engineered to have higher levels higher systemic levels of fgf21 for the duration of their lifespan and this is pool data looking at both males and females so when looking at median and maximum survival in this study maximum survival is defined as five percent survival so 95 of the colony had died and only five percent was still alive we can see significant increases for both median and maximum survival in the fgf21 overexpressing mice when compared with mice that had normal levels of fgf21 now in terms of plasma levels of fgf21 regardless of if the if this was measured in the fed or fasting state fgf21 mice overexpressing mice had five to ten fold higher levels of circulating fgf21 when compared with mice that had normal levels of fgf21 so what are fgf21 levels in methionine restricted mice so they're increased in methionally restricted mice which is what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got fgf levels in plasma and then we've got our three groups low normal and high methionine intakes and we can see significantly increased fgf21 in plasma in the low methionine group so about a two-fold at least a two-fold increase for plasma fgf21 in the low methionine intake group related to the higher methionine intake groups so with that in mind what's my data and more specifically what's the percentage of methionine in my diet so for that let's venture over to patreon where i've just added a specific tier that will include extra data from youtube videos so if you're interested in that check it out and before you go we've got a bunch of discount links and merch that i'm going to show you in a second first for the discount links epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all those links will be in the video's description and now our channel also has merch so if you're into interested in that that link will also be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
