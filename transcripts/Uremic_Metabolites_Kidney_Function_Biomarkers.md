# Uremic Metabolites: Kidney Function Biomarkers

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Kidney function declines during aging and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got the gfr estimate or egfr as an index or biomarker of kidney function and on the x-axis we've got age from about 20 to 95 years old in youth we can see that the egfr is relatively high around 125 but in 95 year olds it's dramatically lower about 55. So here we can clearly see that the egfr again as a biomarker of kidney function declines during aging now that's in part because egfr is most commonly calculated with circulating levels of creatinine and when there's reduced kidney function we we would expect to see increased levels of creatinine in blood now creatinine levels increase during aging and that's we can see here with serum levels of creatinine on the y-axis plotted against age on the x within the 20 to about 90 year age range and here we can see a slow but consistent increase significant increase you can see that p-value is far below 0.05 for circulating levels of creatinine in other words creatinine levels increase during aging now note that creatinine may not be a good marker of kidney function in advanced age and that's because muscle mass is proportional to blood levels of creatinine so here we here we've got circulating levels of creatinine on the y-axis plotted against muscle mass in kilograms and there we can see a positive correlation in other words higher muscle mass is correlated with higher circulating levels of creatinine whereas lower muscle mass is correlated with lower circulating levels of creatinine now note that muscle mass as everybody i'm sure knows declines during aging so with that in mind we'd expect to see less creatinine release from muscle into the circulation but also note that during aging and because of decreased kidney function there would be expected an increased circulating level of creatinine so when considering these two variables lower and higher levels of creatinine potentially in blood we may not see an age-related change for egfr as that biomarker of kidney function when using creatinine in contrast success sorry cystatin c is a better marker of kidney function in advanced age as it is less sensitive to changes in muscle mass now without going through that story i want to focus on how it changes during aging and all cause mortality risk for people who may be interested in tracking it so first systatin c increases during aging that's what we'll see here on the y-axis we've got circulating levels of systatin c plotted against age from about 30 to 100 years old and then for people who had no clinical risk factors we can see that age-related increase forces statin c more specifically relatively lower levels would be indicative of good good kidney function whereas relatively higher levels would be indicative of poor kidney function now the age-related increased forces statin c is important because relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis here we've got survival probability plotted against survival time in other words starting from the initial assessment of statin c sorry it's hard to say starting with that initial assessment after a certain amount of years in this case more than 15 years how many people were alive versus dead after about a 15 or a little bit more than a 15-year follow-up so when looking at the lowest levels of systatin c less than 0.7 milligrams per liter which would be expected to be found in youth we can see that almost everybody was still alive more than around 15 years later with a very small mortality about five percent of the initial population had died after that 15 or so year follow-up in contrast people who had relatively age levels of systatin c want greater than 1.08 milligrams per liter those values you'd expect to find in an 80 year old or older based on the plot in the middle we can see that almost half of that initial population so starting with the systatency of greater than 1.08 more than 15 years earlier about half that population died about 15 years later thereby illustrating lower is better but potentially better forces statin c but these aren't the only two ways to assess kidney function there is another way to evaluate it and that involves uremic metabolites which by definition accumulate in blood in the presence of poor kidney function so how are they formed where they come from so just using a few examples dietary intake of the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine but also of choline are metabolized by gut microbiota so gut bacteria into indols phenols and trimethylamine tma bicoline conversion of choline into tma these metabolites are further metabolized either by gut bacteria or in conjunction with the liver into other metabolites for example indoles are converted into is endoxyl sulfate iaa indole acetic acid or indole acetate phenols into paracresol sulfate and tma into trimethylamine oxide tmao so these four metabolites are uremic metabolites now these urine metabolites increase during aging and that's what we can see here so starting with those four you remove metabolites that i just went through on the left they're relative levels and these aren't levels in micromolar but these are relative levels as an untargeted metabolomic approach was used in the study and if you're interested in the study this and all the other studies will be in the video's description so looking at levels of these uremic metabolites in 97 year olds when compared with 67 year olds we can see that each was a lot higher in the older group when compared with the younger group in many cases almost two-fold or more higher and these differences were significant in looking at the p-value and fdr false discovery rate uh if it's less than 0.05 it's a significant difference and you can see each of these four metabolite comparisons between groups are all below 0.05 in other words the older group had relatively higher levels of uremic metabolites these form uremic metabolites but these aren't the only uranium metabolites there are many and just to illustrate here are seven more dimethyl arginine one one in three methylhistidine trigone it's hard to say so i won't say but the one that starts with the t trans-hydroxyproline aconitate which is found in the tca cycle and kanyein and if you're interested in the full uremic metabolite list it'll be in that paper that i just popped up also in the video's description so for these seven additional metabolites we can see that they too are higher in the older group when compared with the younger group and significantly higher now we don't have to sit idly by for urine metabolites to accumulate during aging they can be tracked and potentially optimized and this is where io lows at home metabolomics kit comes in which i've posted many videos about and if you missed those videos that i just rolled into the screen i'll put them in the right corner now this kit also has more data for more than 500 metabolites so i have more videos coming discount link in the video's description if you're interested in using it so what's my data so we can see that here so i currently have data for two tests i just got my data for test number three today so that'll be that update will be in a future video and we've got these 11 urine metabolites and i think that instead of looking at them each individually i think the sum as a group a uremic metabolite group is more instructive so for the first test we can see that the sum was relatively low around 41 micromolar but then it increased on that second test to a 62 and a half micro molar so that's going in the wrong direction because again remember your metabolites increase during aging and with decreased kidney function now most of that came from paracresol sulfate as it more than doubled test over test so i'll have my eye on that going forward to see what i can do to reduce it now interestingly creatinine which is also uremic metabolite because it increases in the presence of poor kidney function to to have an increase in urine levels uh uremium metabolites when using considering that creatinine is used to derive the egfr as a biomarker of kidney function to see higher levels of urine metabolites we'd expect to see higher levels of creatinine but we can see that that's not the case as creatinine levels were basically stable or slightly decreased test over test in other words we could have no change in egfr but have an almost 50 percent increase for urine metabolites in other words urine metabolites may provide more information besides just looking at creatinine as an index of kidney function all right so what's optimal in terms of the sum of these uremic metabolites and that's very debatable as most metabolomic studies as i mentioned are untargeted they don't actually quantify the direct levels of each metabolite it's relative comparisons between groups in contrast with this kit this iola at home metabolism kit which gives direct quantification so what's optimal in terms of that is debatable but i think what is more certain is that we try to avoid an age-related increase for uremic metabolites so that'll be the plan going forward trying to bring that 62 and a half back down to 41 or lower if i can we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
