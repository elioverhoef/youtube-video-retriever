# NMN Ban? No Problem, Low Dose Niacin (60 mg/d) Increases NAD

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that supplementing with 600 mig of nasin per day more specifically nicotinic acid increased ned to 67 micromolar which is about 2 to three times higher than my baseline of at most around 25 micromolar but on the same day as that test i sent blood for epigenetic analysis and we saw my worst epigenetic pace of aging as measured by dun and pace at 0.98 so with that in mind can lowd do nicotinic acid raise nad and potentially not mess with the epigenetic pace of aging so to test that i supplemented with a 10 times lower dose 60 mig of nicotinic acid for 10 days i then sent blood to gfinity for nad analysis and if you want to measure your own nad levels there'll be a discount link in the video's description and then for an october 2nd test we see we can see that my nad levels were 38 micromolar which as we'll see in a minute is above my baseline of again at most 25 micromolar but where the story gets intered is that 60 mig of nicotinic acid per day increased n as much as 1,000 mig of nmn and that's what we'll see here so i've tested ned levels in 2023 so far 11 times and when i first started without any precur nad precursors nmn nr uh nin we can see that my baseline was 25.6 micromolar i then supplemented with 300 mig of nmn per day which didn't move the needle in terms of increasing nm uh nad levels but when supplementing with 1,000 mig of uh nmn per day we can see that that increased it to 39 micromolar which is in the same ballpark of what i saw with just 60 milligram per day of nicotinic acid so if there's an nmn ban no problem lowd dose nicotinic acid at least in my case just 60 mig per day increases nad now i mentioned that above about 25 micromolar is my upper limit for my baseline and we can see see that i've got six tests below 25 micromolar without ned precursors but i've been able to get ned above 25 micromolar for uh five tests we just saw the 1000 mg of nmn per day we saw 60 mig of nicotinic acid and then there are three other tests where i was able to get it above 25 micromolar for one of those tests it was supplementing with vitamin b6 9 mig per day and i may go back to that since that's a relatively low dose that didn't mess with other biomarkers and then for the other two it was highd do nicotinic acid which 600 mig per day which we saw raised it to 67 micromolar and then again 600 milligram of nicotinic acid but then i added tryptophan trying to maximize ned production through the day noo ned synthesis pathway all right so what i don't yet know even though i know that lowd dose nicotinic acid can increase nad i don't yet know if that nad rise and that low dose of nin can impact d and pace so stay tuned for that data i'm going to send that blood for analysis at the end of november results probably sometime in january all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for ned quantification epigenetic and tmia testing atome metabolomics oral microbiome composition atome blood testing including apob green tea die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die triying brand including the one i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the videoos description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
