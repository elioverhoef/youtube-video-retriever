# Vitamin B6: Increase NAD Without NR, NMN, or Niacin?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Nad declines during aging and that's what we can see here activity or levels of nad plotted on the y-axis against age on the x and there we can see that any d levels are relatively high in youth and then lower in advanced age now to counteract the age-related nad decline and are niacin and nmn are popular and we can see that by taking a look at any d synthesis pathways as shown here so starting from nr nicotinamide riboside or niacin as nicotinic acid or nicotinamide we can see that nicotinamide and nr are converted into nmn which is then converted into nad similarly nicotinic acid is converted by a series of enzymatic steps on its own into nad now what's potentially underappreciated about any day synthesis is that there's another branch that leads to nad synthesis as shown here and it involves the amino acid tryptophan which is commonly found in almost all foods tryptophan is converted also by a series of enzymatic steps into nad e now is an age-related blockage in the tryptophan nad pathway limiting conversion to nad that's what we'll go over in this video and to investigate that question let's take a deeper look for how tryptophan is converted into nad and that's we can see here so starting from the top we've got tryptophan and then we've got nad at the bottom of this pathway now first tryptophan is converted by one of two enzymes ideo or tdo into chin uranine tdo is convert converts dietary tryptophan in the liver into chin uranine whereas idio indolamine dioxygenase converts tryptophan into chin uranine in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines or immune activation for example interleukin-6 il-6 tnf alpha or interferon gamma would lead to immune activation and increase the expression of ido which would convert tryptophan into kanyernine now chin uranine increases during aging which is what we can see here in this study of about 2600 people with plasma levels of kinurian on the y-axis plotted against age and in this case the age ranges from about 40 to 80 years and there we can see that there is an age-related increase for chin uranium so that we've got an age-related chin uranine increase but a decline for nad suggests that there's a blockage somewhere in this pathway so let's see if we can find it so going forward conjuring would then be converted into three hydroxycon uranine also known as hk and note that b2 is required for this conversion so that raises the question is vitamin b2 also known as riboflavin is b2 status sub-optimal thereby limiting conversion of chin uranine into hydroxychioreanine and maybe that's where the block in this pathway lies so to if that's true we'd expect to see decreased hydroxycut urinine during aging so is that true here we're looking at plasma levels of hydroxychon urine hk again plotted over that same age range 40 to about 80 years and we can see that there's an there's also an age-related increase for three hydroxycut ironing so from that we can conclude that vitamin b2 is not deficient because we've got age-related increases i've cut ironing and also an age-related increase for three hydro hydroxycon uranine if b2 is limiting we'd expect to see we would not expect to see an age-related increase for hydroxychon uranine so let's go forward and see if we we can find a potential blockage three hydroxycline uranus should then be converted into three hydroxy and thronilic acid haa and let's take a look at how haa changes during aging and that's we can see here plasma levels of hydroxy andthronic acid on the y-axis plotted against h and again over the same 40 to 80 year age range and here we can see that haa declines during aging which then raises the question or it raises the interesting fact that vitamin b6 is required for the conversion of hk into haa so is tryptophan conversion into nad blocked by an age-related depletion of b6 vitamin b6 so if b6 is limiting we potentially are getting a less efficient conversion of hydroxychon uranine into hydroxy andthronic acid as a potential explanation for why haa declines during aging instead of increasing during aging like kind urine and hydroxycontinine so to address that question of b6 potentially being the block let's take a look at how plasma levels of paradoxyl phosphate which is the exact version of vitamin b6 required for the conversion of hydroxychon uranine into hydroxy andthronic acid and that's what we can see on this plot plasma levels of paradoxyl phosphate on the y-axis plotted against age and in this study the age range was from birth all the way up to about 90 years and in this study which included data from four separate studies we can see that in each of them there was an age-related decline for plasma levels of vitamin b6 so that then raises the question can nad intracellular levels of nad be increased with vitamin b6 supplementation so with as a word of caution the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin b6 has been defined by the food and nutrition board at the institute of medicine as a hundred milligrams per day now to put that into perspective the rda for vitamin b6 is 1.3 to 1.7 milligrams per day depending on age and gender pregnancy status and factors like that but nonetheless that's a pretty wide range that that we could potentially use to increase b6 with the potential goal of increasing nad so with that in mind for my last blood test for the 42 day period that preceded my last blood test test number two in 2023 on march 6th my average b6 intake was 3.2 milligrams per day and for a long time i thought that that may be sufficient because it's at least two times higher than the rda so with the goal of not just affecting homocysteine and if you missed that video i'll put that in the right corner with the goal of potentially uh increasing nad2 i've increased my vitamin b6 intake for the my upcoming test on april 24th so since the march 6th test i've averaged 10.2 milligrams of vitamin b6 per day now this may not seem like a big jump but it's a three-fold increase from where i was and my goal is to increase b6 slowly because i i want to increase nad potentially increase homocysteine and not mess up any other biomarkers if i jump too fast with too high of an increase i think the possibility is greater to potentially affect other biomarkers in a negative way so i don't want to do that i'm going to take it slow and see if i can find the minimal dose that maximally optimizes nad but also potentially homocysteine and to do that i'm going to use ginfinity which tests nad so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be
