In terms of fitness related videos on this channel so far i've only posted two and both of them are pull-ups so how many pull-ups could i do in 2020 uh 2021 and how many in 2020 well my usual workout includes a lot more than that it's a full-body 80-minute workout that includes strength training but also a variety of other movements aimed at optimizing not just strength but mobility balance flexibility and so on so in today's video i'm just going to focus on the strength training portion of that uh so let's get into it to start off uh pull-ups so my previous highs for pull-ups were 12 in both 2021 and 2020 so let's see if i can get at least 12 in today's video so i apologize for the camera angle i wanted to be able to get the camera angle so that you can see chin above the bar but my legs are crossed so my feet don't touch the ground at any point during the pull-ups i should emphasize too that i i aim for full extension full flexion i'm not interested in doing half reps to build strength through a half or partial range of motion i want to build strength through a full range of motion for every movement that i do all right so that was 13 and then i do a uh one pull-up with an inside grip because it's easier to do than the pronated grip uh so that's what i did there and then i walked towards the camera because i was gonna go pick up some weights but then i realized uh this is basically like a semi superset where i do just a few squats to get my legs ready for uh heavier squats and some deadlifts later on so i just do three uh squats and these are atg squats so um uh it's full so i'm looking i'm aiming for a full range of motion with my squats so you can't see it um with the camera angle so i've got to work on that camera angle in future videos so then i do a few more pull-ups really try to burn it out i go for three with the uh palms forward pronated grip and then i'll do another inside grip all right so then i get a now i actually go to pick up the weights and it's just a little bit of weight these are 10 pounds in each arm in each hand uh and i'm gonna go do those uh three more you know squats so atg squats so uh full uh full depth squats just to warm up uh my my hips and thighs again to get ready for the squats and deadlifts uh later on and this is kind of a super set because i'm not standing around uh waiting to do the extra reps for my pull-ups it's while while my lats and biceps are recovering a little bit i'm you know working my legs or at least warming up my legs all right so then i'm just going to finish it up with three more uh pronated palms forward pull ups and then another one on with an inside grip as that's easier to do than the pronated grip and i should mention that my usual workout for this not only the strength strength training portion of my workouts but my full 80 minute workout i do that once every three days sometimes once every four days if my schedule gets in the way if it was up to me i would do it once every three days without fail um but that's what i stick to and that's what works best for me being able to maintain strength over time all right so i just showed you the pull now i go to a push and this is an overhead shoulder press i didn't show you the warm-up i do a quick warm-up with 20 pounds i do 20 reps just to warm up my shoulders uh and so the bar is 20 about 22 pounds actually so this is 70 pounds which may not seem like much but my current body weight is 152 so it's about a little less than half my body weight so i aim for 12 strict form reps uh no leaning back just just press overhead full range of motion all the way down all the way up and from workout to workout i make sure that i meet these rep goal targets so for every workout i'm doing uh when i do uh pull-ups i get 12. Sometimes 13. Today i got 13. Um i haven't gotten to where i'm consistently getting 13 every time but i'm getting at least 12 four pull-ups um with again 13 today same thing for the shoulder press when i go to 72 pounds it's 12 reps and that's without fail and i do that to standardize the workout so that i'm not going to get weaker in any of these movements all right so i just got those 12 reps then i put the weight on my back just to keep warming up my my legs in anticipation for uh going a little heavier uh with uh deadlifts so again you can't see because of the camera angle i'm gonna have to work on that again in future videos but these are atg squats so i'm going all the way down while keeping strict form my lower back and i just do five of those just to warm up my again warm up my hips and thighs yeah and then i turn because i'm not sure about the camera angle because i'm not used to filming my workouts all right the next up i'm just going to do some shrugs so you can see for like two to three minute bursts i'm it's it's like building strength endurance because i'm lifting the whole timer i'm holding the weight the whole time it's not just not just a 15 second burst uh which in has has its role in a fitness program but uh i'm aiming for the combination of strength and endurance uh full body not just in one movement all right so that was my first set and then i go a little heavier on the second set for the shoulder press uh in this case it's 90 pounds so i added 10 pounds on each side sometimes i go as high as 110 or 120 i may show that in a future video but for this i aim for five reps 90 pounds 92 pounds sometimes when i get a little bit less sleep than i'd like i get four reps but the goal is to get five every time and for almost exclusively all of my workouts i i get five reps i'm trying my best not to lean back and just maintain strict form full extension full flexion all right just like before put the weight on the back get a few reps warm up my uh my legs my hips and thighs in anticipation we're going a little bit heavier uh with deadlifts and i'm sure there will be people who will say well you should go very heavy do heavier squats you know that's that's not a lot of weight and this is true but in my youth uh i had plenty of days of going heavy you know to squatting two two to fifty uh and i ended up messing up my back whether it's from over training or poor poor form so um and i've had herniated discs so i'm trying to minimize that because aside from sleep deprivation in my experience injury makes me feel old so i'm not i'm trying to avoid injury so a little bit more on the shrugs i actually do a bunch of sets for shrugs um try not to lose muscle mass in my traps which is very easy if i'm not doing shrugs all right so then i go to the the trap bar to start doing some deadlifts um and this is just 45 pounds and if you notice i'm holding the the bar upside down most people hold it with the grips a little bit higher and i do that so that i can get a little more range of motion and that's why i turn to the side because uh my goal is to get strength through a full range of motion with the grips flipped the other way i'm losing a little bit of range of motion so i want to get as much range of motion as possible so i flip the grip like that and then add a little bit of weight this is still technically like a warm up 95 pounds on the ball right now nothing too crazy um and i've had a tendency in the past to round my upper back when doing dead lifts so and i actually did there for a couple reps not good but for the majority of my technique is is pretty decent where i'm keeping my back arched and tight while doing deadlifts and then a few more shrugs i am bending my knees to try to get a little bit more momentums to uh to you know it's a little bit heavier in terms of a shrug maybe it's not heavy for most people but i'm pushing 50 you know so uh and i'm trying to maintain strength over time again i'm not looking for ego lifting i'm trying to you know maintain and optimize muscle mass so now we've got 135 on the bar going a little heavier and it's same thing five reps i get bored after five reps so uh that's why i'm just sticking to the five rep range my technique's pretty good here you can see the lower back is tight no rounding decent depth controlling the weight all the way down not slamming it off the floor finishing up up with some shrugs all right and then for the last set i just put another 10 pound on your side so this is 155 it's not close to my you know my one rep max but again i'm trying to find that balance between minimizing my injury risk and leading to a flare-up of the herniated disc in my back uh and optimizing strength you know so i could probably go heavier i've gone heavier 175 but to be totally honest i'm a little bit scared to go heavier than that considering my lower back injury history so i'm happy to be getting any strength strength training on my legs especially using deadlifts and somewhat with a little bit on the squats all right so that was the the beginning of the uh push pull so now i go back to a little bit more push-pull uh this is kind of like doing a seated row um and again i'm doing this workout at my house i don't have the machinery to do a seated row so the angle on this uh is basically like doing a seated row and my goal here is to get 13 reps uh and once i get to a a rep target again i stick to that going forward and then the goal is to keep increasing reps over time so if i'm doing 13 reps in this movement and then a year from now i'm doing 14 i'm okay with that because aging i'm supposed to decrease reps you know uh whether whether because of less strength or you know just choosing to to move to move less so i'm trying to stick to a rep range and not go lower all right so then i go to uh uh push-ups off a ball can you the angle is pretty bad here you can't see that my toes are pointing on the ball uh but in the next set i figured out a better angle so that should be good and again i'm looking for a full range of motion um you know strength through a full range of motion that's the goal here and i'm up to 23 reps in this movement now when i first started this maybe two years ago this movement uh i was doing less maybe 17 on the first set so i've improved my strengthness movement over time it hasn't it hasn't decreased all right so that was 23 and then a couple of quick stretches inverted l stretch the upper back and then i get into a cat pose stretch the the lower back um all right so back to the second set of my of my pull this is you know again like a seated row and i'm only doing two work sets for this movement and also two work sets for push-ups um because again in an 80-minute workout there's only so much time uh to get everything in and there are other movements that i didn't show in this video a lot of other movements most of it being warm-ups and and uh you know so i cut that out um but other movements you know like uh side bends and and uh hamstring lower back stretches uh but at some point i'll probably put all that in a full uncut video and i do get 13 reps on this second set so i may actually add i have a weight vest i may i may add a weight vest to that movement to get a little bit more uh resistance on that second set all right so here we go second set of the weighted ball push-ups and you can see my feet are my toes are pointed up on the ball which is a little bit more difficult and the ball the ball adds you know uh not just resistance but it's also have to balance the ball and it isn't touching the side of the couch there it's on its own so i have to balance the ball while also doing the push-ups so um easier said than done but that's what i do so for the second set i get uh the goal is 17 reps and i've been pretty consistent in getting 17 reps without fail for a long time for as long as i've been doing this exercise and again the goal is to increase that slowly over time knowing that with aging there should be a decrease over time i'm trying to resist that for as long as possible all right so then last but not least this is uh from the knees over toes youtube channel uh and this is an exercise aimed at building strength like basically strength of the knees and ankles um and it looks weird but it's it's great for my knees and ankles and then to give my my quads knees and ankles a rest i do a hamstring stretch since it's such a quad dominant movement that you know doing a basically a superset with the hamstring stretch which is what i'm doing there is giving my quads that momentary break so then i warm up my knees for a few reps and then you can see i go to a reverse nordic and i've got a long way to go to get all the way to the floor going backwards with that but that's where i am with it for now yeah full range of motion there would be my back going all the way down to the floor and i do 15 of these uh but i'm somewhere in the 12 to 15 range depending on how my knees feel on that day my knees are generally very good when i'm hoping to keep them that way for you know as many years as i physically can all right that's all for now if you're
