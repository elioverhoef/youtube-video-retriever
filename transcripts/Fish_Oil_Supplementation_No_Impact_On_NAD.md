# Fish Oil Supplementation: No Impact On NAD

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

During aging the day novo nad synthesis pathway is dysfunctional and we know that because quinolinic acid increases during aging whereas nad levels decline during aging that highlights a potential block in the conversion of quinolenic acid into nad which is shown here so under normal conditions quinolenic acid is converted by qaprt into namn and after two more enzymatic steps we get conversion into nad but there may be an age-related block at qa prt so in earlier videos i've pitched the hypothesis that we may be able to increase qaprt activity or levels and or activity thereby increasing nad so for my most recent nad test i decided to try fish oil fatty acids including epa and dha and if you miss the y behind that question i'll link to that video in the right corner so did fish oil fatty acids increase nad so for this test i supplemented with 2.1 grams per day of omega-3 coming from fish oil for 18 days before testing and i didn't change my baseline fish intake which mostly comes from sardines i then sent blood to jinfinity for nad analysis discount link in the video's description for those who want to do that themselves and then for a september 11th test i got an nad level of 18 and a half micromolar which is a bit below my baseline nad of 20 to 25 micromolar so from these data we can see that we can get an answer to our question about fish oil potentially increasing nad and the answer is definitely not so for the next test i'll return to nicotinic acid supplementation which we can see after three enzymatic steps is converted into nad but rather than looking at what can happen i know that nicotinic acid in my case definitely increases nad as 654 milligrams per day in the past raised nad to my highest level yet of 67 micromolar but as we saw in the last video that may have pushed my dunedin pace so my epigenetic pace of aging towards my worst data over seven tests so with that in mind what's the lowest nicotinic acid dose that can raise nad without messing up any other biomarkers so for the next test the plan is to go with 100 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid 60 milligrams coming from n a 40 milligrams coming from diet so 100 milligrams in total for niacin i should have said and will that be enough to get an nad boost if not i'll slowly increase to find that lower limit that may increase nad but not mess up any other biomarkers the plan is to test on october 2nd so stay tuned for that update video coming sometime later in october all right that's all for now if you're interested in more of my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification epigenetic testing at home metabolomics or a microbiome composition at home blood testing including april b green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
