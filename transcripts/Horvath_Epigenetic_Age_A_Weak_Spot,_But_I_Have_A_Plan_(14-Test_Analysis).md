# Horvath Epigenetic Age: A Weak Spot, But I Have A Plan (14-Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age is the horvath clock and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got dna m ag or dna methylation age or epigenetic age plotted against chronological age on the x-axis and then we can see many different colored circles on this plot this is a multicell and tissue clock in terms of the horvath correlation with chronological age we can see that it's almost perfectly linear as evidenced by its correlation coefficient of 0.94 we can see that the p value is far below 0.05 and note that in this case for a positive correlation 1.0 is perfectly linear so 0.94 is close to as good as it can get so with that in mind what's my data so to test that i s blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own horvath epigenetic age and other epigenetic tests discount link in the videos description so for the most recent test that i have data it's for the april 29th test this was blood test number uh three in 2024 it takes about a month for the results to come in so here we are about a week later after getting results in this video and in terms of the results that's what we'll see here so when compared with my chronological age of a bit older than 51 years we can see that my intrinsic age or horvath epigenetic age is 58 years 7 years older than my chronological so this is absolutely terrible news but i think it's important to highlight you know weak spots and not just focus only on you know where i've been successful in optimizing biomarkers currently hor bath's epigenetic age is one of my weak spots so but note that this is just one test as i do for all tests all biomarker tests it's important to have more context and i as i mentioned i have 14 tests since 2022 so what does that data show and that's what we'll see here with horvath epigenetic age from 2022 through 2024 now when i first started measuring in 2022 over three tests average horvath epigenetic age was 55 years still older than my chronological by 6 years on average but it was better over eight year uh eight tests in 2023 with an average horvath epigenetic age of 52.8 years now i don't know if that small 22-year reduction is because of stuff i was doing to try to reduce horbath epigenetic age or maybe the three tests in 2022 weren't actually representative of my horath epigenetic age whereas the eight tests are closer to a true representation of a full year average there's just no way to know all right and then in 2024 when including this most recent test which looks like a giant outlier compared to the others but nonetheless it is what it is my average in 2024 is currently 54.2 years over 3 test so uh at at best there's basically been no change over these three this 2 and a half year period but at worst we can see that in each year horvath's epigenetic age the average horvath epigenetic age is older than my chronological so still horvath's epigenetic age there is room for improvement now there is some reason for hope because we can see that for at least one of these tests i was able to have a horvath epigenetic age that was younger than my chronological so with that in mind what's the recipe and more specifically what's the plan to improve horvat horvat epigenetic age so for that we'll take a look at 14 test correlations between this epigenetic clock with diet and for those who are unfamiliar with the approach and how i look at correlations let's just do a quick quick run through of that so in terms of the approach since 2015 i've weighed all my food everything with a food scale as shown here and then i enter those food amounts into a chronometer which is a tracking a dietary tracking app and if you want to use chronometer to do the same thing discount link in the video's description and then i manually enter the data from chronometer into a spreadsheet including food intake but also macros and micros and then each blood test has a corresponding dietary average or average dietary intake in other words if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests because i'm tracking diet every day i can take the average of those 50 days and that lines up with the latter blood test so each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake and then i can calculate correlations for diet with biomarkers once i got to three or four blood tests you can do that once you have two blood tests you can't look at correlations but once you start getting to three and four and more you can start looking at correlations now granted there may be a lot of noise in the beginning but with this continued approach and following the correlations eventually i believe one can get closest to the truth of what may be optimal for improving biomarkers at least that's the approach that i've used on the channel for all the other biomarkers since 2015 so with that in mind i looked at 105 comparisons for horvat's epigenetic age with foods macros and micros with the top half of that chart shown here and note that correlations are always posted on the correlation tier on patreon so if you're interested in seeing the full list uh check it out all right so in terms of what's on the on the chart the r low lowercase r is the correlation coefficient and then on the right we've got the p value and note that there are six of the 105 comparisons that were statistically significant at a p value less than 0.05 now as a quick aside a criticism that i've gotten is that i should use a false discovery rate and if you're familiar with other videos on the channel i've used that i'm open to using it but it's a restrictive approach in that when considering a p value less than 0.05 that suggests that five of the significant correlations could be false positives in other words five of the six on this list could just be false positives so adding a fdr or false discovery rate can help account for that but it's restrictive in that it may exclude potentially meaning meaningful or even causitive correlations so on the other hand for the most part i generally try to follow the unadjusted correlations but there are situations where i do adjust models further to gain more insight so in this case we've got protein total fat saturated fat and coconut butter that are significantly positively or at least nominally based on a p value less than 0.05 posibly correlated with horvath epigenetic age what that suggests is that relatively higher intakes of these foods over these 14 tests is associated with or is correlated with my worst horvath data relative to when these uh values for these uh nutrients or foods were at their lowest end of their range so in terms of that range oh before we go there also note that salt and cloves are inversely correlated with horvath epigenetic age so in other words when salt was at the higher end of my intake range which is in the 1700 to 1800 milligrams per day range that was significally correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age and i've taken out i i had taken out clothes for a couple of tests so now i've added them back in to test this cor ation and see if it has anything to do with horvath epigenetic age so in terms of how i translate these correlations into practice then let's take a look at the intake range for these foods or nutrients over these 14 tests so that's what we'll see here for protein total fat sat fat and coconut butter and i've got them colorcoded in green and red so when considering that protein total fat sat fat and coconut butter are positively correlated with horvath that suggests that when their intake is high that may be bad for horvath and again i'm not trying to imply causation but these are correlations on the other hand if my intake is at the low end of my range that suggests that my horath data is better based on the correlations so to follow the correlations for test number 16 i sent test number 15 out last week so it's obviously too late to do that so for the next test test number 16 i'll aim for the low end of my intake range for these four foods or nutrients 95 g per day per protein around 80 gam for total fat 18 or less for sad fat and 8 gr or less for coconut butter to test their correlations with horbath epigenetic age now if these correlations have nothing to do with horbath these correlations will weaken after the next reanalysis after the next couple of tests and then i'll continue to follow whatever correlations pop up at the top trying to follow as many of them as possible based on the understanding that i don't know which if any may impact so i try to follow them all all right but it's also important to mention that if i improve one biomarker horvath in this case will i mess up others the goal isn't to just improve one thing and you know who knows what it does everything else i'm trying to optimize everything simultaneously so with that in mind let's take a look at the net correlative score for these you know food total fat s sat fat and coconut butter with 25 other biomarkers and the full list for all of that data is also on patreon but let's take a quick look at at at at some of those for now so proteins net correlative score is neg5 in other words that suggests that when protein intake is at the higher end of my range that's that's significantly correlated with f a net of five biomarkers going in the wrong direction versus right in terms of how those biomarkers change during aging and their association with all cause mortality risk and similarly total fat sat fat and coconut butter also have net negative correlations with the 25 biomarker panel that's representative of multiple organ systems so when considering that these correlations are negative and when considering the correlations with horvath if i reduce intake of these foods or nutrients that suggests that i may be able to improve horath and not mess up the other biomarkers that may be impacted by protein total fat sad fat and coconut butter whether that's true we'll find out in subsequent tests all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing including or ned quantification at home metabolomics or microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health which includes aple b but also grimage green tea dieet tracking with chronometer as i mentioned earlier or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's
