Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity so first let's have a look at the mouse model of longevity here's survival data for control animals and lit lit mice which are in black circles these are animals that have a mutation for the in the growth hormone receptor thereby leading to 99 reduced levels of circulating growth hormone so when looking at survival median survival is indicated by 50 survival this is when half the colony has died half is still alive and uh maximum survival this is 10 survival this is when 90 of the colony has died and only 10 percent is still alive we can see a significant increase for both median and maximal lifespan in the lit lit mice uh which are otherwise known as dwarf mice or little mice so we can see that circulating levels of bile acids as i've written here are elevated in this mouse model of longevity and we can see that data there so here are seven bile acids as uh contained in blood for the little mice for wild-type mice and the ratio between the little mice the dwarf mice with wild-type mice and then to the far right is the p-value for whether the differences are if whether these amounts are different between groups so what we can see is for all of these bile acids with the exception of one alpha muricholic acid all of them are significantly higher in the dwarf mice when compared with the wild type mice and not just a little bit uh higher but a lot higher ranging from 2.8 fold to 5.4 fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild type and you can see at the bottom too that total levels of these bile acids are 4.2 fold elevated in the dwarf mice were compared with the wild type so from this we can conclude that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan although the primary intervention was the mutation in the growth hormone receptor bile acids as we can see by this data are associated with an increased lifespan so what about causation so in an earlier video we saw that one of these bile acids the primary bile acid known as colic acid was significantly higher in the dwarf mice 3.5 fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild-type and colic acid on its own extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging which is what we can see here so in this study they used the zmp ste 24 knockout mice and this is an accelerated aging model or a mouse model of progeria which is accelerated aging a genetic model of accelerated aging so they split half these mice into control fed and colic acid fed ca more specifically 0.1 percent colic acid was supplied in the diet and what we can see by looking at median so 50 survival and maximum survival which was defined as 20 so viral so in this study it was 80 percent of the colony that died only 20 was still alive we can see a significant increase by seven percent for median lifespan and a borderline significant increase for maximum lifespan lifespan with the p-value for maximum lifespan being right at the border p p value equals 0.054 so what about other bile acids we see that one at least one bile acid can extend lifespan what about other bile bile acids can they extend lifespan so i think a good idea is to look at other bile acids on this list and to look into the literature to see if any of them have extended lifespan in other animal models more specifically what about lithocolic acid which was 3.5 3.7 fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild type so first we can see that lithocolic acid extends lifespan and yeast so here we're looking at the percentage of live cells or alive yeast cells on the y-axis against days and cultures so these are yeast cells grown in cell culture and when looking at the wild-type yeast these uh yeast were not supplied with bile acids so that's the black squares as shown there and when looking at median survival again 50 survival half these cells have died half are still alive we can see that median survival for the wild type non-bile acid supplemented yeast was 12 days now notice there is a dramatic extension in lifespan shifting the survival curves to the far right and as you guessed it lithocolic acid so yeast that were supplemented with lithocolic acid you can see there's a dramatic increase in median lifespan up to 30 days so that's a 250 fold increase or 2.5 fold increase for median lifespan in lithocolic acid supplemented yeast but note that this is when the yeast cells are grown under 0.2 glucose and these are calorie restricted conditions as we'll see in a minute so uh does lithicolic acid extend use east lifespan without calorie restriction and it does as we can see by the title lithicolic acid extends lifespan and yeast under calorie restricted and non-calorie restricted conditions so what are we looking at here so we've got lifespan on the on the y-axis including both average lifespan on the left and maximum lifespan on the right and then we've got the glucose concentration that the yi cells were exposed to ranging from no zero all the way up to all or point two percent glucose all the way up to two percent glucose so ten times higher than the data that i just showed on the previous slide and then we've got the data for yeast that were not supplements not supplemented with the the colic acid in the open white circles and then the yeast that were supplemented with lithocoic acid in the black and the filled circles so when looking at 0.2 glucose the data that i just showed in the previous slide there was that increase in median but also as we can see here on the left maximum average lifespan mean lifespan but then what i didn't show was there was also a significant increase in maximum lifespan as shown in the right panel all right so what about under non-calorie restricted conditions so from that we go from the point two percent supplemented uh media that had glucose glucose in the media at point two percent and we go to two percent so ten fold higher ten times higher glucose level what's the effect on lifespan in lithicholic acid versus non with the colic acid supplemented yeast and we can see that even under non-calorie restricted conditions 2 percent glucose lithocolic acid supplemented yeast still had significant increases for both average and maximum lifespan so that's why we can see lca lithicolic acid extends lifespan and yeast under both calorie restricted and non-calorie restricted conditions all right so can lithicolic acid extend lifespan in other animal models so for that we go to flies and lithocolic acid extends lifespan and flies too so here again we're looking at survival on the y axis plotted against the age so how long did the flies live and this is data in male one w1118 flies i haven't come across any data for lithocolic acid supplementation on lifespan in female flies if anybody's seen that data please leave it in the comments so we can uh share share the information all right it's been looking at median and maximum lifespan in this study being 50 survival for median lifespan 10 survival for maximum lifespan we can see significant increases in flies that were supplemented with lithocolic acid for both median lifespan and maximal lifespan all right so what about mice can lithocolic acid supplementation extend lifespan in mice and unfortunately i haven't come across that data yet and again if anyone's come across that data please leave it leave a comment i'd be happy to uh make a video uh about that in in the future all right so what about human data is there human data that suggests a role for lithicholic acid on longevity in people so fecal levels of lithocolic acid are higher in centenarian so people who've lived to older than 100 years when compared with younger age groups and we can see that data here so we've got lithicolic acid lca and that's micromoles per gram micromoles of lithicolic acid per gram of feces so how much lithicolic acid was in poop and then there are four groups on the x axis so first centenarians in this centenarian group there were 160 people who had an average age of 107 years and then there were three younger groups older which had an average age of 86 years and there were 112 of those subjects young which had an average age of 31 years 41 of those subjects and then cel which are lineal descendants so uh offspring of centenarians that had an average age of 75 years and there were 22 of those subjects and what we can see is that centenarians had significantly higher levels of lithocolic acid when compared with all of the other groups so higher than the older group higher than the younger group and higher than their kids now let's take a side step as to why this may be important and that's because relatively higher fecal levels of lithocolic acid suggests a role for gut bacteria on longevity so why would why is that the case so starting from cholesterol in the liver cholesterol is degraded by a series of enzymatic steps to produce the primary bile acid chino or kino deoxycolic acid cdca which is then conjugated with either taurine or glycine to form toro cdca or glycocdca now those metabolites those conjugative metabolites are then released by the gallbladder after a meal into the intestine what gut bacteria convert it into either erso deoxycolate udca or lithocolic acid lca so in other words lithicolic acid is exclusively produced by the gut by gut bacteria so all right this was one study that i showed you for uh lithicolic acid levels in poop in humans uh human subjects higher in centenarians have other human studies replicated this finding and they there is indeed another study that looked at lithicholic acid levels in centenarians when compared with younger age groups and that's what we're looking at here lithicolic acid levels in feces or poop so the two groups in this study were uh centenarians or closest centenarians people in the 94 to 105 year old age range that had an average age of 97 years and their kids who had an average age of 67 years 50 to 79 year olds and what we can see is that the centenarians or closest centenarians had a 40 43 percent higher level of lithium acid in feces when compared with their offspring and these this difference was statistically significant as you can see by the p value and false discovery rate fdr were both less than 0.05 all right so with the goal of longevity can levels of lithicolic acid be increased and if so how well exercise may be one way to do that and blood levels of lithicolic acid are increased after exercise so this is after either one hour of endurance exercise or one hour of resistance exercise or strength training so let's break down the data so in this study it was a very small study it only included 10 people and this this study only included men and again if anyone's come across studies in women please leave a comment i'd be happy to share it with with the community so this was young men 24 years old lean with a bmi of 23.7 so not overweight or obese and when i say lean we can see by the body fat percentage was 12.7 which is lean and these were fit subjects that had a vo2 peak of 55.7 so these are not average fitness people this is a relatively high level of fitness all right so what was the endurance training protocol for those who are interested in trying to increase their own lithium colic acid levels or at least reproduce the the findings of this study so there was a 10-minute warm-up on the bike and then it was 50 minutes of biking at 70 percent of their vo2 peak so a relatively strenuous 50-minute bike ride not including the warm-up but one hour of total endurance exercise all right so what was the effect of that one hour of endurance exercise on blood levels of lificoli so before exercise lithocollate levels were 0.01 micromolar and then 60 minutes after exercise that amount was tripled to 0.03 micromolar and it still remained elevated up to 3 hours after exercise at 0.02 micromolar so doubled when compared with before exercise so from this we can see that lithicolic acid levels are increased up to 3 hours after exercise for endurance exercise alright so what about resistance exercise or strength training so first what was the strength training protocol so there there was a five minute warm-up on the bike followed by 15 reps each for squats push-ups sit-ups and back raises and then the actual strength training protocol aside from the warm-up was five sets of ten reps each for knee extension bench press hamstring curls lat pull downs and leg press all right so what was the effect on lithicolic acid levels in blood so again starting from before exercise they had .01 micromolar levels of lithicolic acid in blood which was then tripled either 60 minutes after exercise and 180 minutes so three hours after exercise blood lificolic acid levels were tripled after this resistance exercise training protocol so this then raises the question is lithicolic acid levels are lithicolic acid levels in blood higher in athletes when compared with sedentary subjects and that's another one that i haven't come across that data but uh if so it could uh suggest that that may be one reason why there's an increase in average life lifespan for uh at least animal and animal models for uh exercise training when compared with sedentary uh sedentary animals so uh if anyone's come across the athlete data and lithium acid levels in blood please leave it in the comments i'd be happy to share it with with the community all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
