Which biomarkers are associated with alzheimer's disease to address that let's take a look at a recently published study that included almost 326,000 people in that study the average age was 56 years and then there was a 9-year follow-up in other words starting with the baseline biomarker assessment what was the risk for being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease up to 9 years later so let's start off with the obvious metabolic biomarkers metabolic health on the y- axis we've got four of them glycated hemoglobin total cholesterol triglycerides and serum glucose and on the x-axis we've got the hazard ratio hazard ratio pr one standard deviation increase for alzheimer's disease in other words alzheimer's disease incident risk in terms of what significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and then when the data is completely above one when the 95% confidence interval that's the horizontal line to the left and right of each of the three shapes in green blue and red when that's completely above one we have a significant association in other words higher levels of the biomarker are associated with an increased alzheimer's disease incident risk conversely to the left of a hazard ratio of one if the 95% confidence inal is completely below one in that case higher levels of the biomarker would be associated with a lower incident risk for being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease all right so on to the data so we've got three models first is age and sex adjusted the second is the multivariant model but the third which is the one that i'm most interested in is the disease specific model which includes adjustment for as many factors as possible that can impact the association for blood biomarkers with in alzheimer's disease incident risk all right so first serum glucose not associated with alzheimer's disease incident risk we can see that its confidence interval completely overlaps with that hazard ratio of one similarly glycated hemoglobin hb a1c overlaps with one total cholesterol is just on the borderline of significance we can see that the right side of its confidence interval is just barely overlapping with that hazard ratio of one which would suggest if it were significant that relatively higher total cholesterol in this study was associated with a lower incident risk for being diagnosed with alzheimer's but the most interesting of these four is triglycerides in this case relatively higher triglycerides were associated with a lower incident risk for being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease and if you saw my earlier video on longevity associated triglycerides not all triglycerides are the same in terms of which fatty acids that that they include and there are some triglyceride subspecies that are associated with a greater odds of reaching 85 years whether that's a part of the story i don't know but i'll look more into this story in future videos so from these four biomarkers we can see that relatively higher triglycerides are associated with a lower alzheimer's disease incident risk all right so moving on inflammation one marker c reative protein not associated with incident risk for being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease the liver biomarkers alumen and alkaline phosphatase similarly not significantly associated kidney biomarkers blood uri nitrogen creatinine and uric acid each of these three not significantly associated all right moving on lymphocytes i don't know why they only f focused on lymphocytes they should have if they had lymphocytes but that data wasn't included in the paper nonetheless lymphocytes not significant associated which then brings us to red blood cell biomarkers including total levels of red blood cells the red blood cell count red blood cell distribution width which is if you're familiar with the channel you know is a major predictor of dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age and then the mean cell volume so the average size or volume of a red blood cell so these are the red blood cell biomarkers so first relatively higher levels of red blood cells were associated with a lower alzheimer's disease incident risk which which may not be a surprise because red blood cells decline during aging uh conversely uh mean cell volume the red blood cell volume or mcv relatively higher mcv was associated with an increased alzheimer's disease incident risk and that too may not be a surprise because the mcv increases during aging what is a bit of a surprise though is that the rdw is not significantly associated with alzheimer's uh disease incident risk so if you're using pheno agage and think that that may uh a younger age using phen wage may be somewhat protective against future diagnosis of alzheimer's disease based on the rdw which is a ma again a major driver of lavine's phenoage these data would suggest that that's not the case it it may be important to track other biomarkers including triglycerides and the red blood cell count which are not included on pheno ag all right moving along we've got three more biomarkers systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference neither of these three were associated with alzheimer's disease incident risk and then last but not least we've got the lung function biomarker forced expiratory volume or the fe1 and here we can see that a relatively higher forced expiratory volume so the maximal amount of air that you can forcefully expire in 1 second relatively higher levels were associated with a lower alzheimer's disease incident risk so better lung function lower ad incident risk now that's potentially important this association is potentially important because the forc expir volume again the f1 declines during aging and that's what we'll see here with the fv1 on the y- ais plotted against age and this is from about 10 years old to 85 years old and then we've got two plots on the left we've got data from men about 58,000 people and about 60,000 women on the right two curves top 5% so people who had the highest fe1 and then the median 50% and the curves below that and then we've also got four curves within each of these two curves and i'm going to focus on the data for the healthy non-smokers because if you're interested in longevity in my opinion that should be the default state so for both men and women we can see that the f1 peaks at about 20 years and then declines during aging pretty obvious to see that age related decline but the good news is is that it can be tracked and by using things that we can easily purchase for relatively cheap which is a spirometer shown here and i've ch chose to focus on this model because i wanted identify spirometers that have been compared against spirometry at the physician's office in other words we don't have to go to the doctor to see what our lung function is now in this study and the link for this paper and all the other papers will be in the video's description in this paper this spirometer had a 0.94 to 0.96 correlation with the fev1 that was performed via spirometry at the doctor's office at the physician's office in other words this home based spirometer is as good or has a very strong correlation with spirometry done at the doctor's office we don't have to go to the doctor to do it we can do it at home track it ourselves so with that in mind what's my data and i've been tracking the fev1 since late 2022 september of 2022 and i have 193 uh independent days of data uh going through february of 2024 now a quick note before showing the data uh when i do measure it on each day it's the best of nine trials so essentially it's like a one rep max for my feev out of nine attempts for my best you know my best value out of those nine attempts i i've been generally tracking it 3 days per week and then for every test it's exactly between 9 and 10 p.m. So i've standardized the time because who knows how later in the day or earlier in a day may affect the data so to minimize that variability i've uh focused on a very narrow time window for all of the measurements all right so then we've got the data as shown here now when i first started tracking it wasn't long before i decided to try try to increase the f1 by using a lung specific trainer aimed at offering an increased resistance above you know exercise training to try to get a further boost for the f1 to strengthen my lung muscles that are involved in the forced expiration but i likely overtrained because you can see i actually had a reduction for the fv1 with all the red dots and it's likely overtraining because once i stopped using the lung specific trainer we can see that my fev1 started to increase such that in 2023 average fe1 over 134 different measurements 134 different days of data average was 3.25 l per second now we're in 2024 and so far the data is a bit better over 21 different days sample size is obviously smaller so hopefully i can keep this up for the remainder of the of the year for the remaining 10 months my average f1 thus far in 2024 is 3.38 l/s so how did these data compare against age expected fv1 so for that we pull up the charts from before and when looking at the median values my age expected fv1 based on chronological age i'm currently 51 years would be 2.95 l so i'm doing a little bit better more specifically the 3.25 lers per second for my current for my 2023 f1 would be the median value for someone about 10 to 11 years younger so pretty good news better than age expected f1 now the goal isn't to get to 4.5 l which is the top 5% for a 20-year-old i don't know if i've ever had values that that that high but for for certain though is to avoid the age related decline and because i'm tracking it 3 days per week if i start to see any dip over a few weeks or longer then the goal is to go back to the lung specific trainer and and optimize the duration and frequency that i'm using it so that i'm not overtrained and i can get a small increase to resist that age related decline all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of
