# Blood Test #6 In 2021: What's My Diet?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video when using morgan levine's phenotypic gauge calculator we saw that my biological age was 12 years younger than my chronological similarly using aging.ai i was 20 years younger than my chronological age so how am i doing it well first in terms of supplements and i i've mentioned this in other videos i've been taking levothyroxine 137.5 micrograms per day for more than 20 years as i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s now although i took it out from my last blood test i included methyl b12 for this blood test once every three days a thousand micrograms so about 300 micrograms per day with the goal of reducing my homocysteine and that'll potentially be a topic for another video what about average fitness stats now note that this is from my last blood test on november 1st through uh my 12 12 the day before this uh blood test number six so that's a 42 day period and these are my average stats over those that 42 day period so i weigh myself every day my average body weight was 155 pounds so about 70 kilograms resting heart rate rhr 42 about 42 beats per minute bpm heart rate variability uh hrv about 50 milliseconds uh so uh those are cardiovascular health related metrics now for the previous blood test blood test number five in 2021 and that for that period it was from september 2nd through 10 31 october 31st of this year but my previous data there was 155.6 pounds for body weight so a small decrease and then resting heart rate was a little bit lower in the previous test and heart rate variability was a little bit higher on that previous test so for this test those data actually went in the wrong directions now because i have a 42-day period for this blood test and a 59-day period for the last blood test i can compare those two groups of data using an uh two-sample t-test and then i can evaluate statistical significance so these two groups of data are statistically significant so i had a small but statistically significant decrease in body weight and then also small but statistically significant uh increases for resting heart rate and a reduction for heart rate variability but note that these small alterations for body weight and cardiovascular health-related metrics weren't enough to affect biological age as on my last test for using levene's test it was about the same so 37.1 years and for aging.i the previous value was 30 years whereas on this test it was 29 so with that in mind what about my diet so here's my average dietary intake and then again is that 40 to 42 day period from the last blood test up until the day before this blood test and this is my average daily intake in grams per day with the exception of green tea which is an ounce ounces so that's ranked number 24 so it's ranked in terms of amount with the highest amount at the top and lowering you know lesser amounts as we go down the list now i'm not going to go over why the foods at the top top of the list are have that abundance i've covered that in other videos i'm going to focus on the foods that were different for this period versus the last and why i made those changes so at number five we can see mushrooms and if you follow my video series on quantifying biological age and my diet breakdowns uh that correspond to those biological ages this will be the first time you've seen mushrooms now i i've had mushrooms in the in the past uh just not uh before i started this video series in 2020. So 166 and a half grams of mushrooms per day and that amount of mushrooms gets uh yields about 11.8 milligrams per day of spermadine so why is spermatidine important and i have a video on this if you're interested in that and missed it it'll be in the right corner so maybe you can check it out so spermidine increases lifespan and mice and that's what's shown here just as one example of the data force spermatidine impacting health and potentially lifespan so when compared with the control fed animals in black the spermatine fed animals in red had a significant increase in median lifespan so what about data in people so in terms of all-cause mortality risk that's what we're looking at here or the cumulative incidence of death on the y-axis and this is uh when starting with a baseline sperm data intake and then 20 years afterwards so a 20-year follow-up and in that study people that had a sperm indian intake greater than 11.6 milligrams per day they had the lowest all-cause mortality risk and then values lower than 11.6 uh milligrams per day of spermatidine had an increase significantly significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so that's one reason why i shoot for at least 11.6 milligrams of spermanium per day which just for mushrooms i'm getting that i'm getting that from other foods too but i get at least that just for mushrooms now other notable changes were my cumulative intake of corn oats steel cutouts and barley and when those three are combined i my intake my average daily intake was 154 grams per day in comparison with the previous blood test blood test number five in 2021 uh it was only 32 grams per day and only from corn oats and barley were not in uh were not in the in the diet composition that corresponded to blood test number five so i 5x the intake of corn oats and barley cumulatively relative to the uh my last blood test so the obvious question then is why did i increase whole grain intake for this blood test so to start to answer that let's take a look at my glucose levels over the past six plus years since i started tracking both uh my diet with uh weighing you weighing all my food with a food scale logging into chronometer and then putting that data into an excel sheet and then also in 2015 i started blood testing up to six times per year so over that six plus year period i have 32 blood tests and as we can clearly see my blood glucose levels have been increasing over that six and a half year period and in fact for the last 15 blood tests my glucose levels have been greater than 90 milligrams per deciliter again for 15 blood tests in a row this is definitely going in the wrong direction because glucose increases during aging and higher levels relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so what may be impacting glucose so to begin to address that i looked at correlations for my macronutrient intake that corresponds to each of these blood tests with glucose levels and that's what's shown here so the little r is the correlation coefficient and then the p-value is uh the measure of statistical significance with a value less than 0.05 indicating statistically some the value the correlation being statistically significant so let's start with what's not statistically significantly correlated with glucose levels and that's my total calorie intake as shown there the p-value at 0.88 that's not a significant correlation now the strongest correlation for my glucose levels is for total fat intake the higher my total fat intake that's significantly correlated with a higher glucose level and conversely a higher average daily carbohydrate intake is significantly correlated with lower glucose now then that means may seem paradoxical to some but note that my carbohydrate intake is not from processed junk which would be expected to raise fasting glucose and in support of that idea we can also see a significant inverse correlation so in other words a relatively higher fiber intake is significantly correlated with lower glucose so most of my carbohydrate intake comes from fruits vegetables nuts and seeds and some legumes and which those are fiber rich foods which may explain why carbohydrates in my case are significantly correlated with lower glucose now note that it isn't just fat a higher fat intake that's correlated with higher glucose also protein intake as shown there um so for the for my highest average daily protein intake that corresponds to the uh to a single blood test during the six plus year period was 147 grams per day for this blood test though i consumed less than that so about 108 grams per day so if i was consuming closer to 147 i would try to cut my protein intake with the goal of cutting glucose but you know reducing my glucose levels but since i've already made that cut for protein that that suggests that the emphasis should be on reducing my total fat intake so let's look a little bit more into into this total fat story and how it may be impacting my biomarkers not just glucose so my fat intake my average daily uh total fat intake has been increasing since 2015 as shown there so average daily fat intake on the y-axis plotted against time and we can the two plots the plot for glucose on the left and the plot for fat intake so each thought course is the fat intake that corresponds to a blood test on the left they look virtually identical so note that this isn't accidental as i mentioned i've been tracking my diet uh every day since 2015 so i've done this purposely in order to have enough data at a low fat intake at an intermediate fat intake and at a high fat intake so that i can properly evaluate uh whether you know what fat amount is optimal for me at least based on glucose right now i'm going to get a little bit more into that with the big picture biomarkers in a minute now for the most recent blood test as indicated by the green arrow i cut my total fat intake from the last blood test from 116 grams per day which was close to my highest intake that i've had over the past six and a half years to 94 grams per day and correspondingly glucose went down now again that's just a correlation correlation does not imply causation but for the next blood test i'm working on reducing my total fat intake to in the 80 to 85 gram range so at least another 10 gram cut and if correlation does uh there is some causation for total fat on glucose in my case we'd expect to see glucose levels drop and potentially two to somewhere in the 80s for the first time in the past 16 tests now note that for uh this to happen and for fat to be fat to be implicated in a potential uh uh you know reduction in my glucose levels uh because my protein intake is also correlated with higher glucose i i should keep that approximately the same as where it was for the last test at about 108 grams per day and that's that's the goal so keep protein the same as the last test reduce fat intake and correspondingly increase carbohydrate intake to follow the correlations and that's one reason why increased intake of oats barley and and corn because those are mostly carbohydrate-rich foods but note if this is kind of a reductionist approach only focusing on glucose if i reduce total fat intake will it improve glucose but make other biomarkers worse so what's the correlative effect of total fat intake on the big picture biomarkers and uh so what are the big picture biomarkers and if you've missed this data in previous videos i'm just going to go through it relatively quickly so the big picture biomarkers are 23 blood-based biomarkers uh that are indicative of multiple organ systems and things like insulin sensitivity like fasting glucose but also i've got a homocysteine on the list there as an index of uh you know a rough index of methylation three markers of kidney function three markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins hdl ldl vldl like protein a all the major immune cells and including platelets red blood cell related metrics a measure of inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein and then the overall biological age score is indicated by the means phenoage and aging.ai so note that if total fat intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than the wrong direction then a higher daily fat intake may be optimal for me and note this may not apply to everyone else but we can all replicate this approach uh you know looking at correlations between diet with biomarkers to get at the personalized approach that can potentially optimize health so in terms of what's significantly correlated there are 11 significant correlations with a p-value less than 0.05 for total fat intake with these 23 blood biomarkers so again 11 significant correlations for total fat with these big picture biomarkers so then the next issue is to address whether these 11 biomarkers are going in the right direction or the wrong direction in terms of how they change during aging and their associations with all-cause mortality risk so seven of these are relatively straightforward and i've presented um pretty much all of these data in other videos and if you're interested in that just leave a comment and i'll direct you to where you can find uh the aging and all-cause mortality data for these given biomarkers so uh a higher total fat intake is significantly correlated with seven biomarkers going the wrong direction and that includes glucose blood blood urine nitrogen bond vldl neutrophils a lower lymphocyte percentage higher monocytes and higher platelets so right off the bat we've got seven of the 11 going in the wrong direction with a biomarker going in the right direction a higher total fat intake is significantly correlated with a lower mcv so lower mcv is found in youth and a lower relatively lower mcv is significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality rates so that's going in the right direction so then we've got three left uh aspartate amino transparent amino transfer taste ast ldl and red blood cells now those i've tagged those as debatable based on the published literature because if we go by just the published literature having lower ast is optimal based on all-cause mortality risk and then conversely higher red blood cells is a good thing because they decline during aging and having lower amounts is also associated associated with an increased law cause mortality risk ldl is debatable there are studies showing lowers better and higher is better but when i do a biomarker versus a biomarker analysis so ast versus all these big picture biomarkers in my data actually relatively higher is better and then conversely too red blood cells when i do biomarker versus biomarker analysis having lower red blood red blood cells is actually significantly correlated with more biomarkers going the right direction than wrong so that's why i put three of these in the debatable column ldl follows a similar pattern but for sure we've got these seven that are going in the wrong direction seven of the eleven so from that i conclude that having a higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with more big picture biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and note that beyond just the correlations with glucose this explains why i reduced fat intake for this most recent blood test and then correspondingly why i increased my carbohydrate intake predominantly from corn oats and barley so what does the rest of the diet look like i've already shown my protein intake and the first 26 foods what about the rest of the diet so here's the macro micro nutri micro nutrient composition that corresponds to blood test number six so in terms of calorie intake uh 23 73 calories per day i've already shown the protein intake uh in terms of total fat we can see i averaged 94 grams per day and if you're interested in the full breakdown in turn in terms of mufa pufa saturated trans fatty acids et cetera that's there and then in terms of carbohydrates you can see all the full breakdown there including fiber uh total fructose and sucrose intake and then net carbs after subtracting fiber from total total carbohydrate intake uh full vitamin breakdown full mineral breakdown i'm kind of doing a data dump here i've discussed why i have higher than the rda for many of these if you're interested in why a certain macro micronutrient is much higher than the rda just leave a comment and i'll explain away and then last but not least uh whereas i showed the first 26 foods here are the remaining lesser amounts of the remaining 26 foods so 52 foods were consumed during this 42 day period and foods 27 to 52 are shown there all right that's all for now uh if you're interested in more about my biohacking attempts to hack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
