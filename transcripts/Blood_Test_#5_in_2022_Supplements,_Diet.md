# Blood Test #5 in 2022: Supplements, Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Today's video will be part three of analyzing blood test number five in 2022's results in part one we saw my biological age data including levine's biological age which showed that i was 15.6 years younger than my chronological and similarly using aging.ai 18.6 years younger than my chronological now in part two we looked at potential weaknesses in my data into including total cholesterol levels and dhea sulfate so in part three we'll see what's contributing to these data so let's start off by having a look at supplements now i mentioned this i've mentioned this in earlier videos but i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking levothyroxine since then for this blood test 137.5 micrograms per day and then i occasionally take melatonin at night either before bed or in the middle of the night when i wake up so i took it very sporadically for this test only three of the 42 days that correspond to this blood test that i take melatonin and in that case it was a very small amount such that my average melatonin take over that period was less than 11 micrograms per day note that's micrograms and not milligrams and then usually i take vitamin d because i live in boston where there isn't i don't get much sun exposure unless it's the summertime but because it's the summer time i didn't take any vitamin d instead i got regular sun full body sun exposure at least two to three days per week or as many days more than that that i could get and 30 to 35 minutes per session now i've gone for longer than an hour per session in the past but i've noticed some sun damage so for this summer i decided to go for at most 30 to 35 minutes per day when i got regular sun exposure and that's it no other supplements no jail protectors or cenal linux so what about diet how does diet relate to blood test number five in 2022 so first how am i tracking diet so we can see that i blood tested on august 22nd of 2022 but that says nothing about how diet may relate to that so i did mention that there was a 42-day period when i talked about melatonin so that so the average daily dietary intake from my last blood test which was on july 11th through the day before this blood test on august 21st so that 42-day period corresponds to blood test number five in 2022. So let's just go through that approach a little bit more for people who may not be familiar so here we're looking at the calendar more specifically july and august of 2022 so we can see blood test number four on july 11th and we can see blood test number five on august 22 and those 42 days in between now every day since 2015 or april 2015 and more specifically for the 42 days that corresponded to this blood test i've weighed all my food using a food scale and more specifically this exact uh version of a food scale right there so i then entered those food amounts into chronometer and this is just what i've used since 2015 it's easy to use and i can't say which is the best that's just what i use and if you're interested in using chronometer i have a discount link check out the video's description so i then enter daily chronometer data into a spreadsheet excel spreadsheet nothing special and the average intake for those 42 days including individual food amounts macro micronutrients would then correspond to blood test number five so note that each blood test since 2015 then has a corresponding diet composition so because i have a lot of data for both diet and blood biomarkers that correspond i can then calculate correlations for diet with blood biomarkers and then based on that data i can alter my dietary intake to optimize blood biomarkers so let's start off with uh looking at individual food amounts that corresponded to blood test number five in 2022. So this will be the average intake for that 42-day period and just as detailed in earlier videos so at the top top right and top left we've got the amount in grams sorted by rank so the most abundant food that i ate would have a rank of one and all the way down to the lowest uh would be which would be walnuts on this plot 21 grams per day so in earlier videos i've addressed why these foods are at the top carrots strawberries mushrooms red bell pepper beets collard greens and watermelon and if you're interested in that analysis it'll be in the right corner it's in test number four in 2022 so again it'll be in the right corner now the primary goal for this blood test was to maintain test number fours and overall 2022's improved biomarker data when compared with the previous two years of data 12 blood tests so in other words to keep the diet mostly the same but i'm always making small tweaks to the diet with the with the goal of further optimization it's never a perfect system so i did make some changes for this blood test and diet so what were those so there were some unintentional changes i'll start with that so we can see that my strawberry intake for test number four was 622 grams per day and for this test it was about half that now costco ran out of strawberries i usually get frozen organic strawberries they ran out so i didn't have a choice but to use uh i like i like having berries in my diet for many reasons but uh so i had to switch to a three bear mix that included strawberries but also blackberries and blueberries so we can see that for this test i had significantly significantly higher levels of blackberries and blueberries when compared with test number four which i didn't have any so that was an unintentional change what about intentional changes and one of those was sardines so you can see that i inc significantly increased my sardine intake from an average of 99 grams per day in test number four to 114 grams per day for test number five so why did i do that well the majority of my b12 intake comes from sardines so for test number five that was 11 and 11.4 micrograms per day of b12 that came specifically from sardines and note that my total b12 intake is 12.2 micrograms so that's almost exclusively all from sardines and the rda for b12 is 2.4 so i'm already you know four to four four to five fold higher for the rda just from sardine intake so prior to this test the importance of b12 is that b12 was significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in my data so before going going into that story first let's take a look at why homocysteine is important so here we're looking at how homocysteine is associated with uh organ systems in terms of function and or health and more specifically we can see that when homocysteine is relatively high greater than 15 micromolar as shown in the middle it's associated with adverse health and or function of many organ systems including cardiovascular brain eyes and ears the reproductive apparatus in women pancreas bone and kidney now also note that homocysteine increases during aging and we can see that here with plasma levels of total homocysteine on the y-axis plotted against age going from 12 year olds all the way up to older than 80 year olds and we can see that for both men and women homocysteine significantly increases during aging from values of around six to seven micromolar in youth to values of around 11 to 12 micromolar in around 80 or 80 year olds so what about older than 80 years old if if you if you're familiar with this channel the my motto is the conquer aging or die trying and i'm serious about that i don't want to just get to 80 or 90. I really intend on living as long as i physically can and hope hopefully breaking the longevity world record 123 years old so what does homocysteine look like in older than 80 years old so here we're looking at data from a study of more than 1700 centenarians these are people that had a median age as as you can see on the left of 100 years and for homocysteine for serum levels of homocysteine in this group we can see that their values was were 23.1 micromolar which is even higher off the off the chart when compared with the aging data up to 80 year olds so in other words if we live long enough we may all have elevated homocysteine now i mentioned that prior to this test b12 is significantly correlated with lower home assisting in my data so let's take a look at that and we can see that here and note that i i've i don't have a lot of data before 2017 even though i've been tracking diet since 2015 but from 2017 to 2022 i've been tracking homocysteine virtually with every blood test so i have 20 blood tests measurements over the past five years for that so we can see that the higher my b12 intake the lower my blood levels of homocyten are with a correlation coefficient of negative negative 0.65 so it's an inverse correlation and we can see that p-value is less than 0.05 so it's a significant correlation now note that uh for uh for the largest what appear to be the largest changes uh it's with methyl b12 supplementation with an average homocysteine level of 9.4 micromolar uh with relatively higher levels of b12 in my in my diet or supplementing with it in contrast when i don't supplement with it or having supplement supplement supplemented with it over these 20 blood tests we can see that it's higher at 11.9 micromolar so then the easy question would be why not just supplement with b12 what do you what do you care if you get you know 12 micrograms or 10 micrograms from diet why not just take a thousand a day as i've done for many blood tests as shown on this plot well a relatively higher b12 intake is significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so let's detail that approach by taking a look at the data so here we're going to take a look at correlations for b12 intake with big picture blood biomarkers as shown here so for those who may not be familiar with this approach what are the big picture biomarkers so they include things like glucose but also homocysteine uh as just directly under it three markers of kidney function three markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins uh immune related cells and globulins which are proteins three red red blood cell related measures including red blood cells themselves a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c-reactive protein and then the overall biological age score using levine's test and aging.ai now there's a little bit more information on this plot so we can see that the little n next to each biomarker is how many blood tests that i have that corresponds since 2015. So for example we can see glucoside 37 glucose measurements since 2015 and then the r the little r at the top left is the correlation coefficient and the p-value is the measure of statistical significance with less than 0.05 being a significant correlation all right so what's significantly correlated for b12 with these big picture biomarkers so first as as you saw in the last plot and this was uh up to 20 blood tests so that was my thinking after the last blood test test number four so this is i've reevaluated the correlations after every blood test we can see now homocysteine has 21 blood test measurements in that plot so we can see that the correlation is a little bit different but nonetheless we can see that b12 is still significantly correlated with lower homocysteine so i've given it a green arrow as that's going in the right direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk however relatively higher b12 is significantly correlated with higher glucose higher blood urea nitrogen bond higher alkaline phosphatase higher levels of neutrophils and monocytes but a lower lymphocyte percentage now in terms of how each of these biomarkers change during aging and their association with all-cause mortality risk these correlations are going in the wrong direction so i've given them red arrows now b12 is also significantly correlated with three other biomarkers workers too higher ldl higher platelets and higher red blood cells now these aren't as straightforward as the aging and all-cause mortality data for example red blood cells and platelets decline during aging so these positive correlations with b12 would suggest it's going in the right direction because we it could potentially reverse that age-related decline but within my own data doing a biomarker versus biomarker analysis there are two there is such a thing as even being too high even within the reference range at least for me so that's why i've given red blood cells and platelets red arrows because too high within my data is significantly correlated with an overall biomarker profile that's got more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and then the ldl story is a little bit more complicated but if anybody's interested in that just leave a comment and i'll detail all the biomarkers that um or they i'll detail the ldl story why i've given that a red arrow all right so with all these red arrows and only one going in the right direction homocysteine we can see that b12 has a net correlative score of minus eight so what does that mean what do i do with that information so these are rules that i've set up uh and so if the net score is positive i would eat above my average intake and if the net score was equal to zero i would eat at my average intake so in this situation the net score is negative and very strongly negative which suggests i should eat below my average intake for b12 in order to minimize any potential adverse effects on multiple biomarkers so my average b12 intake since 2015 is 542 micro micrograms per day and note that so some can say well just take in 300 micrograms per day or one or two hundred micrograms per day but homocysteine wasn't dramatically reduced at 300 micrograms per day with an average of about 10 micromolar so um with that in mind i try to increase my sardine intake granted a very small increase but i thought it was possible that maybe there was some bioavailable bio availability issues if i got a little bit more from food would that be better than taking a mega dose of b12 that i would never see you know just by eating real food clearly that didn't work so i'm going to have to come up with another strategy to reduce b12 and i have other homocysteine videos so those that want to say try tmg the trimethylglycine or folate and b6 i've already detailed in that that in other videos and those approaches didn't work for me so what about the rest of the diet i've already detailed the first 23 foods what about the remainder of the diet and we can see that here again same approach in terms of the highest amount of foods at the top down to the lowest intakes at the bottom and ranked in terms of highest to lowest in terms of intake so in terms of intentional changes i also reduce date intake for this test 25 grams per day for test number four about half that for this test and that's because blueberries and blackberries have higher levels of fructose than strawberries so for test number four it was only consuming exclusively strawberries and because of the higher intake of blueberries and blackberries that was increasing my fructose intake and as we'll see in a minute too much fructose in my diet is correlated significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so to ameliorate that i've reduced my data intake which has a lot of fructose now why that's important and how that relates to the homocysteine story is that a relatively higher date intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in my data and we can see that here so i have less data because for data intake because i've been tracking food since 2018 whereas i've been tracking macros and micro since 2015. Nonetheless i've got 13 data points that correspond to between homocysteine and date intake as shown in this plot and we can see that it's an inverse correlation which means that the higher my date intake has been the lower my homocysteine is and again i'm not suggesting causation this is a correlation nonetheless it's a strong correlation as you can see with a correlation coefficient of negative 0.85 so then uh i should mention for this test we can see that my highest homocysteine over this three year period was for this blood test so that would suggest just go as high as possible for dates and that if correlation equals causation i should expect to see a reduction for homocysteine well note that dates have a net correlative score of -4 in my data so that suggests that i should increase them to somewhere below my average intake of 29 grams per day so i'm aiming for about 25 grams per day for this test and note that i'm not convinced that dates will do anything to homocysteine it's possible that my data intake was just highest when i was supplementing with b12 and the b12 is the real effect and dates were just a passenger on that journey if that's true i'm not planning on supplementing with b12 for the up my next blood test in october so if home assistant comes down and it's in part because of higher dates that will be reflected in the correlations if that's not the case this correlation will that then weaken and i'd expect other stuff to pop up and i'll continue to follow correlations until i find the overall approach that keeps my homocysteine relatively low all right so to finish up with the diet note that or at least the diet composition note that my diet isn't always clean so i do have a cheat meal or a cheat day or a cheat two cheat days if you want to call it that so and that happens immediately after i blood test i have some junk and then i have some more on the day after and then i shut it down until the next blood test so in other words i had junk for two days and then i didn't have any junk for 40 days until test number five so that junk for this test was nutella and just to further explain this so if you look at just the average per day it's 3.7 grams and someone on reddit said this guy's eating a you know a small amount of nutella every day for the whole blood test period which isn't true so i had 147 grams of nutella from on the first day and the day after the blood test and then nothing for 40 days but that average ends up being 3.7 grams per day so i mix some nutella with peanut butter and made homemade uh you know reese's peanut butter cups basically so that's what i did and then i also had swedish fish and again that's not once one one gram of swedish fish a day i had 60 grams on the day after the blood test and then nothing for the 40 days after that and then also i chew gum chew gum uh during my usual 75 to 85 minute workout so that's why you see that there all right so what about macronutrients and micronutrients what uh what is what do they look like for test number five so let's start off by uh having a look at calorie protein and fat intake that correspond to this blood test so first calorie intake and this is the average calorie intake for the 42 day period that corresponds to this test it was a bit under 2300 calories so why that amount so let's take a look at correlation analysis using the same approaches before with b12 for calorie intake versus the big picture biomarkers and when i do that uh calorie intake has a net correlative score of minus five in other words it's a calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher levels and you can see that little plus there indicates a positive correlation or an increase in correlation uh with higher levels of alkaline phosphatase alp higher levels of the liver enzyme aspartate amino transferase ast higher ldl higher platelets and a higher rdw so a negative correlative score of -5 suggests that i should eat below my average intake in order to follow correlations so my average since 2015 has been 25.46 so we can see that my current 2294 was below that so we give it a green check so note that as i mentioned the goal is to follow as many correlations as possible for diet with blood biomarkers you know i don't assume that one diet or one macronutrient will fully impact a given blood biomarker or many you know i'd expect that each biomarker has multiple inputs including many biomarkers many foods that could potentially positively improve it and many foods that could potentially negatively affect it so by following the correlations as many of them as possible for each biomarker with diet i'd expect that any effects of diet on the biomarkers would be maximized or conversely if it's a negative correlation minimized all right so for protein for this test the average 97.4 grams per day which is 17 of total calories so why that amount again we do we go to the correlation analysis protein in my data has a net negative correlative score of minus eight and we can see the biomarkers that it's significantly correlated with there now note that a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine so if i only measured homocysteine and nothing else and if this is a real effect of protein intake affecting homocysteine i would then increase my protein intake to my highest level somewhere around 150 grams per day and think wow if you know i've got lower homocysteine now i'm doing great but if i didn't measure the other biomarkers i'd be missing that bigger picture that in my data when my protein intake is relatively high i've got a lot of biomarkers going the wrong direction and only one in this case homocysteine going in the right so a negative net correlative score suggests that i should eat below my average intake which is 112 and a half grams per day so for this test we can see 97 is less than that so i'm following that correlation too all right in terms of fat intake for this test i averaged about 83 grams per day which is about 33 of my total calories so why that amount again we go to the correlation analysis and we can see that in my data total fat has a net correlative score of minus seven including the biomarker shown there with the ones going the wrong direction in red and the ones go in the going in the right direction again in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk in green so that suggests i should eat below my average intake which we can see 83 is less than 86 so i give that a green arrow so total fat intake divides into monounsaturated polyunsaturated and saturated as the primary composition of total fat and i should mention that there's a glitch in chronometer if you add up monounsaturated polyunsaturated they don't add up to 83 and part of that is because my cocoa beans are entered manually so i have the total fat intake for them and the saturated fat intake for them but i don't have about 20 grams whether it divides into mono or polyunsaturated so there's a limitation there and then the type of sardines that i use gives me total fat and omega-3 but it doesn't give me some of the other fats so there's a limitation there in using chronometer uh and nonetheless monounsaturated fat has a net correlative score of minus one of my data which as you can see it's uh mufas or monosaturated fats are significantly correlated with higher glucose and red blood cells in my data but a lower mcv so two in the right direction one in the wrong so the net negative one suggests that i should eat below my average intake of around 17 grams per day we can see 15 is less than 17 so i'm following that correlation in terms of polyunsaturated so omega-3 has a score of plus three and you can see the biomarkers there interestingly one of them is pheno age so for whatever reason omega-3 is mostly coming from sardines and flax seeds are significantly correlated with a younger levine's biological age at least using the blood blood biomarker based version not the methylation based uh pheno age that levine has so three a net score of plus three suggests i should be above my average intake which we can see eight is higher than seven so we give that a check similarly omega-6 has a positive score in my data and we can see the biomarkers there interestingly one of them is homocysteine so that's one reason why i try to limit my omega-6 to somewhere around 16 grams per day because if i go too high that's significantly correlated with higher homocysteine so my average omega-6 since 2015 is 15 and a half grams per day so i'm just above that so i'm following that correlation too and i should mention i think when most people hear omega-6 they think seed oils as you can see by by my di composition on the earlier slides i don't have any seed oils there it's been a very long time since i ate any seed oils technically you could say there are seed oils in nutella but this is a an infrequent you know visitor in my diet so at least for now so and i hope to keep it that way all right so saturated fat has a net score of -6 in my data and we can see the biomarker is there so which suggests i should equal my average intake of 27 grams per day since 2015. 23 is less than 27 so that too is a check and just as a side note it's possible that dairy fats including cheese and yogurt and this is a story for another day but this is just a quick quick youtube short while in a longer video most of the saturated fat storing my data may be driven by saturated fatty acids from dairy so uh yeah i'll investigate that in future videos so i will check it out when it comes all right and then if you saw my last video on total cholesterol i was planning on increasing it and i did increase it for a while but this too is another side story but nonetheless we can see that cholesterol has a net negative score in my data of minus eight with those biomarkers there so i should equal my average intake 126 milligrams per day 24 is less than that so we can give that a check so we can see that i'm for most of the correlations i'm following well actually i'm following all the correlations for fat intake and calories proteins uh calorie protein and fat i'm following all the correlations uh so far so what about carb intake so let's start with total carbs which is about 51 of my total calories so why that amount uh we go to the correlation analysis carb intake it for me in my data has a net correlated score of plus one which suggest i should eat above my average intake and we can see that about 238 is higher than 234 so green check and then further subdividing carbs into fiber and sugars fiber has a net score of plus one which suggests suggests i should eat above my average intake of 97 grams per day but this is one where i'm not following i'm at 91. So this is an interesting one because in my data to get to higher than 91 to get to higher than 97 actually i'd have to really bump up vegetables you know non-starchy vegetables like broccoli but in my data broccoli actually has a net negative score with big picture biomarker so there may be actually a range even though my rules say that when the score is positive to eat above average intake note that that score is one if it was seven maybe it would be a really big deal on the blood biomarkers then i'm not higher than that but when it's 1 or minus one it's right within that range of one standard deviation so is 91 really different from 97 versus 99 maybe not and that may be the case for other biomarkers as they relate to diet as we'll see in a minute all right so another in terms of sugars i further subdivide that into total fructose because i eat a lot of fruit and that's important because total fructose has a net negative correlative score on my data of minus three so i keep an eye on my total fruit intake including total fructose uh and note that sucrose divided by two plus fructose equals total fructose so that suggests i should eat below my average intake of 85 grams per day of fructose 65 is less than 85 so we give that a green check so what about micronutrients so we'll start off with vitamins and i'm just going to run through some of these i'm not going to go through all i'm just going to highlight maybe the the big ones so one of the big ones for vitamins for me seems to be niacin b3 and again this is all from whole food so a score of plus seven suggests i should need above my average intake which you can see 42 is higher than about 36 so we give it a green check now what i want to highlight here is that the rda for uh for niacin is 16 milligrams per day so i'm about two and a half times higher so using this approach i can get closer to the you know a precision nutrition in conjunction with a biomarker optimization so it's basically optimizing two things at the same time now i what would happen if i ate niacin that was somewhere around the rda 18 milligrams per day would i lose you know the uh core you know the correlated score is very positive would i lose the potential effect that niacin may have on multiple biomarkers it's a possibility all right so then b12 as we saw it has a net quarter score of minus eight my average is 542 we can see 12 is below 542 so i'm following that correlation and then last on this list is beta-carotene now when i first started this approach i was showing i had a very reductionist approach i was showing correlations between individual nutrients with individual bomb workers and not even considering the rest of the biomarkers so we can see that beta-carotene has a net negative very strong net negative correlative score of minus eight so it is still significantly correlated with higher album which is good because albumin declines during aging but it's significantly correlated with nine biomarkers going in the wrong direction so with that in mind i should eat below my average intake which is 54 000 micrograms per day we can see that 50 000 is less than that so green check all right so the rest of the vitamins some highlights we can see that vitamin d just from food i averaged about 300 ius per day and that's below the rda of 600 ius per day now again note that i don't supplement with vitamin d in the summer or i generally don't and that's because i'm getting regular sun exposure so some could say well how do you know you're not deficient well i have 10 at-home blood tests using the company quantify and if you miss the that miss that information it's in my last video but there'll be a link in the video's description if you want to use their product and i have a disco discount code sorry so my average vitamin d over those 10 tests during this 42 day period is is about 64 nanograms per ml now deficient for vitamin d is considered less than 30. Above 30 what's optimal is very debatable but i'm definitely not deficient far from it you know based on the my circulating blood levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d all right and then vitamin k has a net correlative score of plus two and the reason that i've highlighted this is because we can see that my average intake is more than 1500 micrograms per day and for this blood test it was close to 2 000 micrograms per day and because the score was positive i should be above my average so we give it a green check so note in this case the what's defined as the rda or an adequate intake ai is only 120 micrograms per day and i'm at 16 fold higher than what's uh you know been determined to be an adequate intake for vitamin k now if that was too much i'd expect to see more biomarkers more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and in support of that you can see my b12 intake has a very strong negative correlative score for being very high above the rda for vitamin k in my case the opposite is true 16 16 times higher than the rda is not significantly correlated with many biomarkers going the wrong direction than right all right and then let's take a look at minerals so highlighting some that i haven't highlighted in other videos including copper which has a net colder score of plus three and i get a lot of copper from mushrooms but also some from cocoa beans so the plus three suggests i should go above my average since 2015 of 4.3 milligrams per day and we can see that 4.7 is higher than that so green check now note that the rda for copper is 0.9 milligrams per day so i'm more than five-fold higher for the rda for copper and i mentioned this in my test number four video for for diet for the diet breakdown but there seemed to be no hard and fast rules in terms of how high one should go for the rda they seem to be very specific maybe five times higher for copper is optimal for me maybe 16 times higher for a vitamin k again optimal for me but b12 going way higher you know we can see that that's not the case only two and a half full higher for niacin maybe maybe optimal for me so there's no standard if you're two times higher or four times higher than the rda for all nutrients it seems like each nutrient has its own specific range for what may be optimal and it may even be individuals some people may have different ranges you know compared to others and then last on this list that i want to take a look at is magnesium which has a net score of zero which suggests that i should eat at my average intake of 802 but we can see i'm at 696 so we would give that a a red x that technically i'm not following the correlation but note that the rda for magnesium is 420 420 milligrams per day so i'm above that you know now i'm above that but i'm not exactly at 800 which is what following my own rules for these correlations would suggest now i mentioned that there may be a range so if you're at negative one zero or one is a hundred milligrams per day really going to make a difference is 7 grams of fiber really going to make a difference but for these other biomarkers like copper or niacin or b12 going the wrong direction you know uh really following as close to the correlations as possible those correlation rules may be better relative to the ones that are right around zero zero negative one one all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon uh before you go we've got some discount links at home blood testing using quantify and you can get a discount that will be in the video's description if you want to measure your own epigenetic age using the horvath hanum and dunedin pace epigenetic clocks got a discount link for that in the video's description oral microbiome composition and i just got my results back for test number two and i'm currently analyzing that to see if it was good bad or neutral so stay tuned for that if you want to track your diet using chronometer we've got a discount link for that or if you just want to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee thanks for watching i hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
