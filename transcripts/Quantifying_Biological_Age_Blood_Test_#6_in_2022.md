# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #6 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The central premise of this channel is that aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and diseases be slowed so with that in mind earlier this week i blood tested for the sixth time in 2022 so with that in mind what's my biological age so first when using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own phenotypic age or biological age that link will be in the video's description so when using this test we can see that my biological age is 34.5 years which is 15.2 years younger than micronological now note that the lab measurement quests high sensitivity c reactor protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 milligrams per liter but it can't be higher because that's the limit of their detection and besides just putting data into a spreadsheet all of the blood test data screenshots of of the lab report will be included at the end of the video now this is just one test so for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and i have 21 blood tests over that time period and we can see that here so first from 2018 to 2019 i only have three measurements but over those three tests my average biological age using levine's test was 36.1 years then in 2020 i tested six times with an average age of 35.6 years similarly 35.6 years in 2021 and thus far in 2022 we can see that i've reduced it down to 34.0 years now besides looking at averages from year to year differences for averages for levine's test from year to year we can compare them statistically and when i use a two sample t-test for the 2020 to 2021 data so those 12 blood tests versus the six blood tests in 2022 i've significantly reduced that levine's biological age with a p-value of 0.04 now this is one way to look at the data another way is by comparing the the chronological age minus biological age and prior to 2022 that average reduction was about 12 years over 15 tests from 2018 to 2021. Thus far in 2022 we can see that the average chronological age minus biological biological age again ca minus ba is has been better than 12 years for each of the first six tests in 2022 with a low of 13.6 years but at my best a reduction of 17.2 years nonetheless the average chronological age minus biological age reduction for the first six tests in 2022 is 15.3 years which we can see is further reduced when compared with the about 12 year average from 2018 to 2021. So this is one easy to use and reliable biological age metric the means test what about aging.ai so aging.ai 3.0 is also free to use and i'm not sponsored by either uh dr morgan levine or by aging.ai i just use it because they're relatively reliable tests for predicting chronological age and free and easy to use so aging.ai it's easy to just type it in go to the website and you put your data in and when entering the 19 variables as shown here i get a predicted age of 33.0 years now and that's i should note that that's 16.7 years younger than my chronological now just like we did for levine's test for more context let's have a look at previous data using aging.ai age date age data and we can see that here and i have a lot more data for aging.ai because it doesn't include crp which is an add-on test here in the us i just started ordering it for every blood test over the past few years whereas early on i didn't include it for every test nonetheless aging.ai doesn't include that so i have a lot more data so from 2009 to 2013 i only have three tests but my average aging.ai age over those three tests was 32 years and then as you can see i started to test more often in 2016 such that from 2016 to 2021 i tested 27 times with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years all right so what about 2022 so over the first six tests in 2022 my average aging.ai age is 29.7 years and when comparing 2016 to 21 2021 data versus the six tests in 2022 these two groups of data are not significantly different in other words my aging.ai age is pretty close to 30 years over the past six year span or seven year span including 2016. And also going back to 2009 my aging.ai age range is consistently in the 29 to 32 year range regardless of my chronological age all right so what's contributing to these biological age reductions what about supplements fitness and or diet and over the next three videos i'll break down each of these specifically to see how they may be contributing to these blood test data all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and we've got some discount links that you may be interested in including epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking with chronometer or if you're interested in supporting the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee now on to the blood test data
