# Blood Test #4 in 2022: Supplements, Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video we saw that my biological age using levine's test was 17 years younger than my chronological and similarly using aging.ai 21 years younger so what's contributing to these data so first let's start with supplements so i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking levothyroxine for about 25 years 137.5 micrograms per day now for about nine months out of the year i supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day but note that in the summer i don't especially on days that i get sun exposure so for the 63 day period that corresponded to this blood test i did include vitamin d but it wasn't every day and then occasional melatonin so this is a very small amount this is about 39 micrograms per day so not milligrams micrograms so uh melatonin either before bed or in the middle of the night to help with sleep but rarely as you can see 39 micrograms per day isn't much and that's it for supplements nothing else including gerald protectors or c analytics so that brings us to diet how is diet or is diet contributing to these data so first how am i tracking diet well note that the blood test is on july 11 of 2022 so how does diet correspond to that so my average daily dietary intake from the last blood test which was on may 9th through the day before to the day before this blood test on july 10th corresponds to blood test number four in 2022 so let's explain that approach a little bit more so here we're looking at may june and july so blood test number three was on may 9th and blood test number four was on july 11 and then in between uh 63 days so for each of those 63 days i weighed my i weigh my food and i've done that every day since april of 2015. I've weighed my food every day using a food scale and then i enter that those food amounts into chronometer and that's the diet tracking app that i've used i'm not here to say that they're the best but that's what i've used and along those lines if you're interested in using a discount link for chronometer that will be in the video's description all right so then that daily data for chronometer i enter into a spreadsheet and then the average intake for those 63 days in between blood tests corresponds to blood test number four and because i have up to uh 38 blood tests since 2015 i can then correlate diet with the blood biomarkers so uh yeah so let's get into that approach a little bit further including looking at individual food amounts so that's we can see here again this is the average daily dietary intake from test number three to test number four it's a 63 day period average intake and starting at the top with the amounts in grams we can see that strawberries were the food that i consume the most 622 grams per day so why are these foods at the top not just strawberries but the others on the list so by tracking diet in conjunction with blood biomarkers i can focus on eating foods that have positive correlative scores with the biomarkers while minimizing intake for foods that have negative scores so what does that mean so first to illustrate let's take a look at correlations for strawberry intake with big picture biomarkers and then as a side note although i've tracked macros and micro since 2015 i only started tracking individual food amounts since 2018. So what that means is i have 23 to up to 23 tests that correlate individual food amounts with the blood biomarkers whereas i have up to 38 tests for macros and micros with the blood biomarkers since i started tracking that in the beginning and it wasn't until later that i decided to start tracking the individual food amounts too so if anyone is interested in this approach i'd recommend attracting both macros micros and the individual food amounts because the macros and micros may not fully explain uh food you know you're reducing food down to 40 or so nutrients that may not it may be too reductionist all right so correlations for strawberry intake with the big picture biomarkers and the big picture biomarkers are listed here and i've covered this in other videos but let's just go through it real quick so they include glucose but also homocysteine three markers of kidney function three markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins immune related cells and proteins for example globulin red blood cells and their related measures a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein and then overall biological age score is indicated by levine's phenoage and aging.ai so as another note uh the little n next to each uh blood biomarker is the number of blood tests that i have so for example for glucose i have n equals 23 that's 23 blood tests that correspond to diet data for or food food intake r at the top on the left is the little r is the correlation correlation coefficient and then to the right is the p value the measure of statistical significance with a value less than 0. 0.05 being being indicative of statistically significant all right so what's significantly associated with strawberry intake so first a relatively higher strawberry intake is significantly correlated with lower levels of the liver enzyme ast lower ldl lower platelets and also lower high sensitivity c reactive protein so then the next question that i would ask is are the significant correlations going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality acm risk now i've covered how each of these biomarkers changes with aging and all cause mortality risk in other videos so i won't go that and go through that in this video but we can see that i've put green arrows there so these are correlations that are going in the right direction in terms of aging for example ast higher than around 29 or around 29 uh is associated with an increased low cost mortality when compared with somewhere in the 18 to 22 range so i've had ast data even higher than 40. So for me having strawberry intake being negatively correlated with ast suggests a higher co strawberry intake is significantly correlated with lower asd so that would be going in the right direction in terms of all-cause mortality risk so using a similar similar analysis for each of these four biomarkers they're going in the right direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk so that leads us to a net correlative score of plus four so what does that mean well if the net score for diet with blood biomarkers was negative i would eat below my average intake since 2015 since i started tracking diet and if the net score was zero i would eat close to or at my average intake for that food or macro micronutrient but in this case if the net score is positive i should eat above my average intake to follow the correlations so with that in mind my average strawberry intake since 2018 is 350 grams per day and as i mentioned my strawberry intake for the 63 day period that corresponded to this blood test was 622 grams per day so i'm following that that correlation which suggested i should eat above my average intake so that gets a green check all right so let's illustrate another example by looking at red bell pepper so here we're looking at correlations for red bell pepper intake with the big picture biomarkers so what's statistically significant so we can see that a relatively higher red bell pepper intake is significant correlated with higher creatinine with higher levels of neutrophils and also a lower level of lymphocytes lymphocyte percentage sorry so these are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or all cause mortality risk for example creatinine increases during aging so we don't want to have relatively higher levels so that red bell pepper is positively correlated with higher levels of creatinine that's going in the wrong direction so all of the red arrows are going in the wrong direction so that yields a net correlative score of minus three now if you remember a net score when the net score is negative that suggests i should eat below my average intake my average daily red red bell pepper intake since 2018 is 298 grams per day so for the 63 day period that corresponded to this blood test i purposefully averaged about 248 grams per day so i'm following the correlations because it's a net negative correlation and i'm below my average intake purposefully and i should say that none of these values the diet intake values are by accident i carefully examine my diet every day to make sure that i'm following as many of these correlations as possible in order to get the best biomarker profile that i possibly can all right so how well am i following the correlations for the other high intake foods which which can help address the question why are these foods at the top in terms of intake so i've already shown strawberry and red bell pepper so for carrots carrots have a net score of plus one and they they are significantly correlated with lower homocysteine homocysteine increases during age during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so that would suggest that carrots if correlation equals causation and that's a big if that carrots may reduce homocysteine in my case i don't know if that's causation but that's what the data suggests so my average intake since uh 2018 since i started tracking food intake is 372 grams per day and because the correlation is positive that suggests i should eat above 372 grams per day but note that i was at less than that for this test so we give it a red x now the carrot store is a little bit complicated because carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene which which as we'll see in a bit uh beta-carotene has a net negative correlative score so i have to be careful with my total amount of beta-carotene containing foods including carrots and then green leafy vegetables broccoli even things like red bell pepper etc all right so for some of the other foods on the list mushrooms have a net score of plus four and you can see uh with the significant biomarker correlations the foods that are going in the right direction are listed in green and going in the wrong direction are listed in red so actually for mushrooms it's five biomarkers going in the right direction one in the wrong direction to get that net score so average intake is 42 grams per day i used to eat a lot more mushrooms prior to 2018 before i started tracking individual food amounts and it wasn't only until about somewhere around this year that i added them back into the diet and we can see that they've got that net positive score so that looks like it was a good idea so 231 is above 42 because the net score is positive it suggests i should eat above my average intake so i'm following that correlation all right next up beats and we can see that beets have a net score of plus eight and i'm not a fan of the term superfoods but with a net score of plus eight that would suggest that beets may be a superfood for me we can see that they're possibly significantly positively correlated with eight all eight biomarkers going the right direction and none going in the wrong direction so my average beat intake since uh i started tracking food intake in 2018 is 115 grams per day and we can see that for the 63 day period that corresponded to this test i'm above that so we give it a green arrow all right collard greens net score of plus one this is one that i just recently added into my diet switching it out uh for spinach which are high in oxalates and i was eating a lot of spinach and oxalates actually have a net negative score uh in my with my blood biomarkers i won't show that data here but if anyone's interested i can indicate which biomarkers are going in the right and wrong direction with oxalate intake so uh nonetheless my average intake for collard greens 14 grams per day since i'm above that i'm following the correlations we give it a green arrow all right so then last but not least watermelon intake watermelon has a net score of plus five five biomarkers going in the right direction none in the wrong my average intake since 2018 152 grams per day and 200 is above 152 so i'm also following that correlation so as i mentioned by following the correlations for as many foods and macros and microbes as possible i expect my best biomarker profile will will result now whether that's the case i don't know but the biomarkers are looking pretty good for now so i'd argue that diet may be contributing all right so what about the rest of the diet here are the first 23 foods but where is the rest of it so we can see that here same approach amount in grams at the top and then uh 40 so i eat 46 different foods for this 63 day period that corresponds to test number four now note that it isn't always clean i do include junk and when i do it's immediately after the blood test on blood test day and then on the day after and then i shut it down until the next next test or i try my best to shut it down so in this case it was 61 days with no junk food so the quote unquote junk food for this test was a small bag of m ms as you can see by the red arrow but then also store bought peanut butter which is roasted and has salt added to it and although that may not qualify as junk i usually eat all my nuts and seeds raw to limit age products so i put that in the junk category for now even though there's far far worse things including m ms and then also i chew gum during my standard 75 to 80 minute workout that i do once every three days so that's a couple pieces of gum every three days uh so that's also in the in the junk list all right so what about macro macronutrient and micronutrient profile how does how does that correspond to test number four so let's start off by taking a look at calorie protein and fat intake that corresponds to this blood this blood test so as i mentioned i have up to 23 blood tests that correspond to food intake since 2018 but up to 38 tests that correspond to macros and micro since 2015. So let's start it off by looking at calorie intake so my calorie intake for the 63 day period that corresponded to this test was about 2302 and then is that too high is that just right is that too low to address that we can do a correlation analysis for calorie intake versus the big picture biomarkers and when i do that calorie intake has a net score of minus five including higher levels of these five biomarkers alkaline phosphatase alp the liver enzyme ast ldl platelets plt and the red blood cell distribution with rdw so in other words a higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher levels of each of these biomarkers which is going in the wrong direction of in terms of aging and all and or all-cause mortality risk so with the net negative score that suggests i should eat below my average intake in order to minimize any potential detrimental effects of calorie intake on the blood biomarkers so my average intake since 2015 is 20 about 25.50 so we can see that for this test i follow that the correlations by eating less than my average intake so it gets a green check all right so next up protein intake about 96 grams per day so why 96 grams per day again we'll go to the correlation analysis and see uh why why that amount and just as a quick note that's 16 16.6 percent of my total diet composition is from protein so correlation analysis protein intake has a net negative correlative score of or a net correlative score of minus eight and you can see that nine biomarkers are going in the wrong direction in red and only one homocysteine going in the right direction so that suggests i should eat below my average intake which is about 113 grams per day and and again this isn't by accident i know these correlations because i re-evaluate for every test and knowing that protein has a negative correlative score i aim for 96 grams of protein for this test so that i'd be under my average intake since 2015 of 113 grams all right so we give it a green check because i'm following the correlations for protein all right so what about fat intake so for this test i average averaged 80 and a half grams per day of total fat and that's 31.5 of my total diet composition all right so why 80 and a half grams for fat so again we go to the correlation analysis and we can see that total fat intake in my data it may be different for other people has a net correlative score of minus seven and it's significantly correlated actually with nine biomarkers going the wrong direction and only two in green going in the right direction so that suggests that i should eat below my average intake which as we can see is 86 grams per day and because 80 and a half is less than 86 i'm following that correlation by eating under my average in average intake when the correlation net correlation score is negative all right so total fat can divide for the be further subdivided into mono and polyunsaturated fats so first starting with the monounsaturated fats we can see that even though they're purported to have health benefits and eat more olive oil and all that even though my diet doesn't contain oils it's from whole foods we can see that monounsaturated fats have a net negative correlative score in my data including being significantly correlated with higher levels of glucose and red blood cells all right so that suggests i should eat less than my average intake which is 16.9 grams since 2015 and because 16.4 is less than 16.9 i'm following that correlation too so polyunsaturated fatty acids can be then further subdivided into omega-3 and omega-6 and as i mentioned chronometer may not be perfect but that's what i've used since 2015. Um you can see that omega-3 and omega-6 at 8 and 16 grams per day should add up to polyunsaturated the polyunsaturated amount of 23 and a half but individually 24 is higher than 23 and a half so there are gl chlorine again chronometer is not perfect but this is what i've used since 2015. So going to the correlations omega-3 has a net positive correlative score of plus two and it's significantly correlated with five biomarkers going the right direction as shown in green and only two in the wrong direction so that suggests i should eat above my average intake which is 7 grams per day and because 8 is higher than 7 i'm following the correlations there similarly omega-6 has a net positive correlative score of plus 3 including those biomarkers there so that suggests i should eat above my average intake which is 15.5 grams and we can see green check because i'm also following that correlation now saturated fat has a net correlative score of -7 so i should eat below my average intake in order to minimize any potential detrimental effects if correlation equals causation for saturated fat on the blood biomarkers so my average intake for saturated fat is 27 grams per day so i was at 21 grams per day for this test so again i'm following that correlation too and then cholesterol very strong negative correlative score of minus nine including those biomarkers there nine going in the wrong direction none in the right so that suggests i should be below my average intake which is 129 milligrams per day so we can see 22 is less than 129 so i'm following the correlation so to sum i'm six for six and following the correlations for fat intake with the big picture biomarkers and and again this isn't by accident i purposefully aim for either above my average intake below my average intake or right at my average intake based on what these correlations show all right so what about carbohydrate intake so first my net carb intake was about 250 grams per day which translates into 52 of my total calories so is that amount too much what is the correlation what do the correlations show so net carbs have a correlative score of plus one which suggests suggests that i should eat above my average intake which is 200 about 235 grams per day and we can see 249 and a half is higher than my average intake so he gets a green check all right so fiber has a net correlative score of plus one so i actually eat above my average intake which is 97 grams per day so 90 and a half is less than 97 so we give that an x but for those who are familiar with the my my channel and who have seen previous uh videos on my diet breakdowns for other biological age tests including test number three in 2022 my fiber intake for test number three was 86 and a half so i increased it by a little bit uh just obviously not enough to get above 97.1 so um there are more details in terms of why i didn't just uh you know add a whole bunch more broccoli or other high fiber containing foods to get higher than 97.1 uh grams of fiber per day so if any was interested in that story just leave a comment and i'll be happy to explain the why all right so then in terms of sugars i track total fructose which is defined as fructose plus sucrose divided by two so 62 and a 62.4 grams of total fructose per day for the 63 day period that corresponded to this blood test all right so net correlative score total fructose has a net score of minus two which suggests that i eat should eat below my average intake which is about 86 grams per day so because 62 is less than about 86 i followed that correlation too all right so what about micronutrients and i won't go through all of these i'm just going to highlight some key points in the vitamins and minerals so first starting with the first half of vitamins uh so let's go we'll take a look at the net correlative score and then the average my average since 2015 and whether or not i'm following the correlation or not and again here if anyone's interested in which biomarkers are going in the right or wrong direction just leave a comment for each of the vitamins and minerals and i'll be happy to share that information so first up niacin note that it has a very positive score of plus six my average intake since 2015 is about 36 milligrams per day for this test i average about 41 milligrams per day and because the score is positive i should eat above my average intake 41 is greater than 36 so i followed that correlation now note that the rda for niacin is 16 milligrams per day so if i only if i only ate at 16 milligrams per day because of the net quality of score being so highly positive that would suggest i would limit myself on any potential causative effects of niacin intake on the blood biomarkers so this approach can help get closer to what is optimal at the individual letter level not just for individual foods but also macros and you know micronutrients including vitamins and minerals so that you know that addresses the question beyond the rda what's optimal should we just aim for the rda or what's optimal beyond that and the niacin story uh you know with two and a half times higher than the rda would uh support this approach in in trying to figure out what's optimal at the individual level all right in contrast b12 has a very strong negative correlative score of minus seven and my average uh since 2015 is 556 micrograms per day obviously that's with supplementation of about a thousand micrograms per day for a lot of the past seven years now for this test i only averaged on purpose uh 10.6 micrograms per day knowing that b12 has a strong negative correlative score in my data so we give that a green check because i'm following the correlations eating below my average intake but that's another example too the rda is 2.4 micrograms so i'm already four four and a half time times higher than the rda so again it goes to that question of how much above the rda is optimal is it 1x 8x clearly not you know 25x because my average intake would be too high based on that net correlative score of -7 and then also beta carotene as i mentioned back with the carrot story beta-carotene has a very strong negative negative correlative score in my data of minus six so my average intake since 2015 is 54 about 54 000 micrograms of beta-carotene per day for this test i purposely averaged about 50 000 micrograms or it's actually equivalent to about 50 milligrams so i'm following the correlations now beta-carotene one of the biomarkers that is significantly correlated in my data is with albumin so i don't want to cut it too low because i may limit any potential effects of beta-carotene on albumin but if i obviously if i go too high based on the net correlative score it may negatively impact many biomarkers so i'm aiming for just a bit below my average and note that there's no rda defined for beta-carotene so this approach can help one get towards what's the what's optimal for each individual you know micronutrient even without an rda all right so finishing up the other half of the vitamins some key points vitamin e with a net score of minus six now my average intake since 2015 is about 25 milligrams per day so for this test i aim for 20 milli milligrams per day falling on 19.8 so because the net score is negative i should be below my average intake and i did that it's a green check so the rda for vitamin e is 15 milligrams per day so if one just went with a general rule of i'm going to eat x amount above the rda for all vitamins and minerals as you can see by my data things like niacin two and a half fold higher than the rda you know a b12 i'm right now four about four four and a half times higher than the rda so there's no general rule for all micronutrients as you can see by vitamin e somewhere around 20 may be optimal for me but if i go higher that's associated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so in other words i wouldn't say that there's a general uh um magnitude that each each micronutrient should be higher than the rda it's individual and it should be assessed individually to to figure out what's optimal for each again individual micro or even macronutrient all right so then also looking at vitamin k vitamin k has a net correlative score of plus three so i should need above my average intake which is uh about 15 15 50 micrograms per day and we can see that i was about 1880 micrograms per day and again i do that on purpose it's not by accident and so we give that a green arrow now note that what's defined as the rda or ai adequate intake for vitamin k is only 120 micrograms per day so in this case i'm more than 15 times higher than the rda now but if 15 times higher was too much i'd expect to see more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and it's a perfect example of that b12 clearly b12 which has a very negative correlative score going too high may be bad for all of my bomb or many of my biomarkers all right so last up are the minerals so some key points calcium has a score of minus seven uh so that suggests i should eat below my average intake so we can see i did that there uh iron net score of plus five that suggests i should eat above my average intake of 28 milligrams per day so i did that there about 31 milligrams per day and that's another interesting one in terms of the rda so the rda for iron is only eight milligrams per day so there i'm 4x higher with a net score of plus five and again i'm 4x higher because it after seeing that it's a net positive score i purposely go higher to see how high you know how high can it go how high should i go in order to to define what's optimal for me at the individual level and then last on this list is sodium with a net score of -4 so that suggests i should eat below my average intake there which we can see that i did 1732 is less than 1889. Now the rda for sodium is less than 2300 but with this uh this approach of looking at the correlations and then basing the diet based on that we can see that maybe even 1900 milligrams of sodium may be too much for me and going a little bit lower may be optimal so all right so just as a last note by using this approach i can get closer to what's optimal at the individual level for n over one at n equals one which goes beyond the rda or inadequate intake ai for many nutrients all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and then discount links which will be in the video's description if you're interested in using diet tracking with chronometer there's a 10 discount link there if you're interested in quantifying your oral microbiome composition there'll be a discount link there and you can use my code conqueraging15 or if you're interested in supporting the channel you can use buy me a coffee and again that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
