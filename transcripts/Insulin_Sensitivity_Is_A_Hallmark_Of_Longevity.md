Insulin sensitivity is a hallmark of longevity but before we get into that data it's important to define terms including insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance so first what is insulin sensitivity so when looking at the fasting state and when the person is insulin sensitive blood glucose levels are maintained by gluconeogenesis which just simply means the liver produces new glucose molecules and that glucose is then taken up by target tissues including the brain adipose tissue or adipose cells fat cells and muscle and note that insulin secretion is low in the fasting state when the person is insulin sensitive so what happens after eating well in the fed and insulin sensitive state the rise in blood glucose that accompanies a meal triggers the pancreas to release insulin and then insulin then triggers the target tissues including the brain adipose cells and muscle to take up glucose now blood glucose levels then fall after this process which removes the stem stimulus the increase in blood glucose after eating for insulin secretion so insulin levels correspondingly decrease uh when in the insulin sensitive state after eating now note that gluconeogenesis is a minor contributor to the blood glucose pool when af in the fed state and when the person is insulin sensitive as insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis so in the insulin sensitive state there should be minimal gluconeogenesis by the liver because insulin suppresses it all right so what happens in the insulin resistance state so where when in the condition where there is insulin resistance target tissues are resistant to the effects of insulin which leads to increased circulating levels of glucose and also note that the liver uh increases its production or there is increased production of new sugar new new glucose gluconeogenesis by the liver in the insulin resistance state because the liver is also resistant to the effects of insulin so it continues to produce new glucose molecules now adding adding fuel to the fire uh the pancreas tries to compensate for the rise in blood blood glucose by releasing even more insulin as shown there so compensatory hyperinsulinemia and in in that case uh blood glucose blood glucose levels would fall but at the cost of having high insulin levels so just to summarize in the insulin resistance state we can have normal levels of insulin but high glucose high levels of insulin but normal levels of glucose and then both high levels of insulin and high levels of glucose and it's important to note that data for insulin and glucose rather than only glucose or only insulin is more instructive for insulin sensitivity status than either of these molecules metabolites alone so let's jump into the data so first calorie restricted mice have an increased lifespan and if you're a frequent viewer to this channel you should have should already know that because i've already presented a lot of that data but nonetheless we're going to look at their insulin sensitivity status so here we're looking at percent survival on the y-axis plotted against uh age or how long the animals lived and when we go to average survival so the 50 mark this is when half of the population has died and half is still alive we can see that calorie restricted mice so this is n cr uh so normal mice on a cr diet the orange triangles when compared with the blue triangles there's an increase in average lifespan and in this study it was 30 calorie restrictions so the animals ate 30 percent less than the normal mice who ate as much as they wanted so what's the insulin sensitivity status of calorie restricted mice that had an increased average lifespan and that's what's shown here so glucose and insulin levels for the normal mice they ate as much as they wanted normal ad lib al and the normal mice that ate 30 percent less calories so first note that glucose levels were not significantly different between those two groups so you can see by the superscripts the letters a and a the same superscript means that there was no significant difference but notice that the mice that were calorie restricted had a significantly lower had significantly lowers of lower levels of fasting insulin in this case there was a sixty percent reduction in the cat restricted mice now as i mentioned in the previous uh slide combined data for glucose and insulin offers more insight about insulin sensitivity status than either of these two alone and one method for looking at the combined effect of glucose and insulin is with the homeostatic model assessment also known as homa which equals glucose in millimoles per liter times insulin in milli milli units per liter and then divided by 22.5 so for anyone that's got glucose and insulin data by blood test i'll post a link to a homo calculator so you can get a sense of where your values are now a lower home of houma value is reflective of insulin sensitivity whereas a higher hormone value would be a situation where there is less less insulin sensitive so with that in mind how did the cr mice compared with the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted the ad lib and this isn't a surprise because whereas the glucose levels were approximately the same uh the homa uh was 60 reduced so 3.37 in the normal mice that were eating as much as they wanted versus 0.15 in the cr mice and that effect is mostly driven by the 60 reduction for insulin levels in the cr mice now note that there are other lifespan curves on this chart so uh what were those animals and how what's their insulin sensitivity status so the green circles are animals where growth hormone releasing hormone hormone was knocked out so the pro a protein that was that is responsible for release of growth hormone was knocked out so uh there should be less growth hormone being in a systemic level there should be less systemic levels of growth hormone so these are ko uh which means that the protein was knocked out so growth hormone releasing hormone knock out mice and we can see that their average lifespan is significantly increased when compared with the wild type animals that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted but no no dif no difference in maximal lifespan for the knockout mice or even the cr mice when compared to the uh normal mice wild type mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted all right so the knockout mice this growth hormone releasing hormone knockout mice they had an extension of lifespan what's their insulin sensitivity status and that's what's shown here so again we're gonna look at the normal mice that were eating as much as they wanted al the cr mice and then the knockout mice that were eating as much as they wanted ad lib and what we can see is first that the glucose levels in these knockout mice were lowest of the bunch so about 20 milligrams per deciliter lower and although the insulin levels in these mice were similar to that found in cr notice that the superscripts b and b are not different the knockout mice had about a more than 50 reduction in insulin when compared with the wild-type mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted and that had normal levels of this growth hormone releasing hormone protein so what about their homostatus and we can see that they have homo levels the homo value that's very similar to the cr mice even though they're not calorie restricted and again more than 60 percent reduced when compared with the normal mice they were allowed to eat as much as they wanted so with this in mind there's still uh one curve left that we haven't talked about and that has the longest lifespan of them all what's the insulin sensitivity status of those mice so for the red circles they then calorie restricted the growth hormone releasing hormone knockout mice and we can see that the average lifespan of those mice was the longest of them all and also note that the maximal lifespan was also increased when compared with the other three groups in fact you can see that they reached 50 months of age which is a rarity in mouse studies i mean very few interventions get to 50 months of age so obvious question then is what's the insulin sensitivity status of these knockout myosin cr and that's what's shown here so glucose levels were similar when compared with the knockout mice that were eating as much as they wanted but lower than the mice that were on cr and lower than the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted ad-lib and then interestingly their insulin levels were the lowest of the bunch so you can see 0.5 versus 0.7 in the knockout mice 8 as much as they wanted lower than the cr mice 0.5 or 0.6 and then you know dramatically reduced when compared with the normal mice that were eating as much as they wanted ad lib 0.5 versus 1.5 and when we look at their homework values the knockout mice that were on cr not only did they have an increase in average and maximal lifespan their insulin insulin sensitivity status when measured by homa was the lowest of the bunch 0.10 so uh just to summarize growth hormone releasing hormone knockout mice on cr they had the lowest glucose the lowest insulin and lowest homo value in conjunction with the longest average and maximal lifespan in this study so note that other animal models of extended lifespan also have relatively low levels of insulin gluc insulin and glucose and one example of that is fgf21 transgenic mice and i have a video for that so if you're interested it'll be in the right corner so lifespan and insulin data in mice is interesting but in is insulin sensitivity a hallmark of longevity in people and one way we can assess that is by looking at the insulin sensitivity status in centenarians when compared with younger age groups and that's what we can see here so we're looking at insulin resistance ir as measured by homa on the y-axis and that's plotted against age starting from 20 to 40 years old as the youngest age group and going all the way past 100 on the far right so first notice that houma increases during age from the 20 to 40 year olds all the way up to the 80 to 90 year olds but interestingly the home of values then decline such that for people who lived older than 90 which is longer than the average lifespan their home of values are the lowest of them all even when compared with the younger youngest age groups uh so old from 90 to 100 and over 100 seem to have better insulin sensitivity at least as measured by houma now another way we can assess this by look is by looking at the prevalence of type 2 di type 2 diabetes which is defined as having a blood glucose level greater than 126 milligrams per deciliter or 7 millimolar or a diabetes diagnosis in the past based on medical records so when looking at the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and centenarians as shown on the right this is a study of a thousand and two centenarians that had an average age of 103 years we can see that the prevalence of diabetes when looking at people who were a hundred to 104 years old in blue 105 to 109 years old in orange and then 110 years old or older in gray we can see that their prevalence is between 9.1 to 12.9 in other words uh 87 to 91 centenarians out of 100 do not have type 2 diabetes whereas uh you know nine to 13 would have uh type 2 diabetes and i didn't post show this data but the average blood glucose levels fasted in the centenarians of the study was 92 which is within the optimal range that i've talked about in other videos and i'll also link to that in the right corner now uh how does so the obvious question is although their rates of type 2 diabetes are seemingly low how does it compare with the diabetes prevalence in younger age groups and it's important to note that the thousand and two centenarians of this study was a chinese cohort so the appropriate comparison would be the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the average non-centenarian chinese population in in china and that's what we can see here so this is a study of more than 170 000 people divided by age groups so younger than 40 that had an average age of 29 40 to 59 that had an average average age of 49 and older than 60 that had an average age of 70. And what we can see is as uh the groups increase in age the prevalence of diabetes a type 2 diabetes increases uh with age two from 5.9 percent in the youngest age group to 12.9 percent in the uh the group that had an average age of 49 to 20.2 percent so 20 out of every 100 people that were older than 60 in this study had uh were diagnosed uh with had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes now note that at worst the 110 year olds or older had a prevalence of 12.9 of type 2 diabetes and the group that that compares most similarly with is are the 40 to 59 year olds so one could argue that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and centenarians is most similar to people that are 50 to 60 years younger now this isn't the only study that's shown that a reduced type 2 diabetes prevalence has been reported for centenarians in the new england centenarian study necs so here we're looking at data for nacs 90 and 100 year olds non-engineerings and centenarians and then necs controls and we can see that there were uh 18 uh 1 807 90 and 100 year olds uh so that there are a lot of people in that group so their average age was 100 and then the controls was significantly younger at 72 years old but then note that the diabetes percent the percent that had been diagnosed with diabetes was only seven percent in the nineteen hundred hundred year olds where it was more than two times higher in the group that was significantly younger so 17 diabetes uh diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the younger controls now they then illustrated this uh in a different way in the same study uh they they they then determine the age when 10 of their respect these respective groups the 1900 year olds or the controls uh that 10 percent had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes so for the controls at the bottom you can see control f and control m on the left side the average age when 10 of the cohort had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was 73 years old in contrast the centenarians uh for them for that group of 187 people 10 uh uh 10 of that cohort was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at an average age of 99 years old so the age of 10 diabetes onset type 2 diabetes was delayed by up to 26 years in centenarians so if the goal is longevity making sure that glucose is optimal within the 80 to 94 range milligrams per deciliter and again i'll link to that in the right corner if you missed that missed that video and making sure that insulin levels are relatively low may be an important pro up approach all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end uh thanks a lot and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
