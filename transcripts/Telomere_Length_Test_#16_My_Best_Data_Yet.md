By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tiir shortening is one of the hallmarks of aging in addition tiir shortening negatively impacts other hallmarks including genomic instability mitochondrial dysfunction and stem cell exhaustion more specifically tiir length declines during aging in both men and women on the y- axis we've got ltl or lucy tiir length so this is tiir length inside of white blood cells plotted against age and this is from 20 to about 80 years old and then for both men and women we can see the age related decline such that in youth average tm length values are around 7.75 kilobases whereas in centenarian or 100y olds it's closer to an average of five kilobases now a central premise of the channel is to slow aging by optimizing biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and t length is on the list so i now have 16 tests for ti length so what's my data how well am i resisting the age related decline and with the goal of moving it closer towards youthful values which factors are significantly correlated with tm length so starting with what's my data that's what we can see here and these data are generated by true diagnostic if you want to measure your own tm length there's a discount link in the video's description on the y- axis we've got tiir length but note that this is a dna methylation based estimation of tiir length which may be a better measured than standard ways to measure t length at least in terms of all cause mortality risk and and if you're not familiar with that data i'll link to the paper in the video's description on the x-axis we've got the collection date and then in 2022 over three tests average t length was 7.05 kilobases but remember youth average values in youth are closer to 7.75 kilobases so i've at least based on 2022 data i had a long way to go to get tary length back towards youthful values and technically this is one of the weak spots in my data as 7.05 kilobases is pretty close to age expected and the goal is to have youthful biomarkers not age expected biomarkers all right what about in 2023 so uh three tests over the span of a year may not be or at least i think it may not be representative of a full year average so in 2023 i tested eight times and over those eight tests average tm length was better at 7.13 kilobases now whether that i i actually increased t length or that's a close representation of the year full year average i'm i'm not sure but nonetheless it moved in the right direction closer to that youthful value of 7.75 kilobases all right so what about in 2024 so for the most recent test we can see that it was my best ever data for tiir length 7.24 kilobases and this is a low probability event as tiir length declines during aging and when considering where i started in 2022 this is an unlikely event to see 7.24 kilobases so then even with that 7.24 kilobase value being my best ever the average in 2024 is still exactly at the same as 2023 data so granted while that's a small win it hasn't declined uh but note that it it isn't better and that's because three of the last six tests were on the low side or the lower side of my t length range so when considering that variability this raises a few questions first can i repeat the 7.24 kilobase value for tm length and then what may have caused the big jump from 7.07 to 7.24 or what may have caused a big jump in seeing my best ever data for tm length and to address that which factors are significantly correlated with tm length so let's go through the approach on how i'm able to look at correlations for diet even or even supplements or any any variable with blood test biomarkers so since 2015 i've weighed all of my food using a food scale and then i enter those daily food amounts into chronometer and if you want to use chronometer to track your own diet there's a discount link in the video's description and then i take chronometer data and enter that into a spreadsheet and i should mention uh we're working on building an app where you can just export chronometer data and take your blood biomarker data and upload that into our app and you you'll be able to calculate correlations on your own uh you know so it won't just be me showing you data we can all do this and use this approach uh to see what may be impacting what in terms of diet impacting biomarkers all right so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there are if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests the average dietary intake for those 50 days lines up with the latter blood test and then knowing that each blood test has a an average dietary intake that lines up with it with enough blood tests and enough track dietary or supplement or fitness data whatever variables you want to track we can look at correlations so after every test i calculate correlations for diet and many other variables with biomarkers including tm length so for this test i looked at 98 comparisons for t length with foods macro and micronutrients and that's what we'll see here 16 test correlations for te length versus diet and note that this is nine variables these nine variables are each statistically significant at a p value less than 0.02 and this is only part of the list because there were 19 food fs or nutrients that had a p value less than 0.05 which is the general measure of statistical significance being less than 0.05 for the p value and if you're interested in seeing the full list that's on the correlations tier on patreon all right so in terms of the correlation that's the lower case r and then at top the list we can see that cloves uh are positively correlated significantly positively correlated with a longer epigenetic estimation of t length so note that this isn't a crazy amount of cloes this isn't an average of at most 4 g per day so i'm not weighing out4 g per day 2 or 3 days per week i mix 2 g of cloves in with other stuff flax seed states etc to get to that relatively high end of my intake range of4 gram per day so what that positive correlation suggests of 076 is that during dietary periods where i've eaten more cloves or cloves higher towards the higher end of my intake r intake range of4 g per day that's significantly correlated with a longer epigenetic estimation of tm length in contrast though saturated fatty acids sfas are inversely correlated with talir length in other words when my saturated fatty acid intake is relatively towards the high end of my range that's significally correlated with a shorter tiir link so saturated fatty acids coming from what interestingly they are also on this list because the majority of my sfas come from two foods coconut butter and cacao beans which are also inversely correlated with tiir length so when i've had relatively higher intakes of those foods tiir length has been shorter note that copper may also be a part of that story as the majority of my copper intake comes from caca beans but also from mushrooms which didn't make the top nine on this list also on the list oh before we go to more on the list if you want to see how this compares to the 15 test correlations uh i posted that in an earlier video which will be in the right corner and i'll have more on that story in a minute minute also on the list is potassium so when potassium is relatively higher towards the higher end of my range t length has been shorter and note that that's my my average range for potassium intake is can be very high as much as 10,000 milligrams per day so this suggests somewhere around more recent intake around 6,500 milligrams per day may be optimal at least based on correlations with teal length and then there are three other foods on this top nine list selenium sardines and calcium each of which i purposefully intake uh increased from test number 15 to test number 16 for selenium i did that for the thyroid hormone experiment trying to increase the free t3 to free t4 ratio which didn't work but that selenium is on this list suggests that a relatively higher selenium intake may be good for the epigenetic estimation of tome length and then it also increased sardines to test their uh plus six net correlative score with a panel of about 25 biomarkers the major of the other biomarkers with the exception of blood u nitrogen and uric acid didn't change pheno age was the same but these data suggest that i may want to keep sardines towards the higher end of my range at least for the next test or the test after that so what do i do with all of this information once i've calculated the correlations well with the goal of optimizing t length but also any biomarker that i'm tracking the goal is to follow as many of the correlations as possible so this isn't just follow cloves it's how many of these foods or nutrients do we need need to impact a given biomarker each biomarker may be impacted by many different inputs both both positively and negatively and i don't know which ones or if any are causitive so the goal is to follow as many of the quote unquote significant using that arbitrary p value threshold less than 0.05 so for test number 17 close will be relatively high or towards the higher end of my range at least point4 grams per day saturated fatty acids will be on the lower end of my range i've purposfully limited caca beans and coconut butter once again although not as low as for the last test so that may make an impact on the next t length data we'll see but then i've chosen not to follow the selenium sardines and calcium intake now if tiir length isn't my best again at 7.24 but is higher than that 7.13 average it would suggest that maybe cloves and saturated fatty acids are involved in mechanisms that impact the epigenetic estimation of tiir length but if it's 7.17 which is still on the high side of my data it could suggest that adding selenium sardines and calcium or increasing them towards the higher end of my range may be needed to get towards 7.24 or higher if that's the case that will be the strategy if that's what the correlations show for test number 18 and then after each test i recalculate the correlation so as i just mentioned the stuff that's at the top of the list i'll continue to try try to follow as many of those correlations as possible with the goal of optimizing that given biomarker in this case being t length the next test is scheduled for a week around a week from today so stay tuned for that those data sometime in october all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go
