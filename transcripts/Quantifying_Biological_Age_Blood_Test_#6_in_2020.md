# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #6 in 2020

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

With the goal of optimizing biological age last week i got my blood tested for the sixth time in 2020 so what's my data what's my biological age so we can see that here um using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is also a measure of biological age we can see that my biological age uh was 33.8 years now when considering that my chronological age is 47 uh that puts me based on this blood test at 30 more than 13 years younger than my chronological age now if you're interested in what's optimal for each of these nine biomarkers in terms of how they change during aging and what's their association for all cause mortality risk uh you can click on the link in the right corner i've discussed that in a previous video so i'm not gonna go over that again for this video so uh let's get further into my data so for the first five blood tests uh in 2020 uh we can see that my range of values from 33 all the way up to 39 years uh a biological age now interestingly note that that 39 measurement this will come up in a later slide i decreased my fat intake and increased my carb intake and that may be what was related to that higher biological age compared to the other measurements now when looking at all six uh biological age uh data for the blood test my average biological age in 2020 over six tests is 35.2 years which is 11.8 years younger than my chronological age not bad now i how does that compare to 2019 you know year to year change biological age now i only measured twice in 2019 uh with biological age uh biological ages of 37.3 years and 33.09 years but the average of those two measurements is 35.2 years so based on that uh one chronological year passed but there technically are zero years of biological aging now whether that's actually uh completely true is unknown because you know i our two blood test results enough to represent a full year of a biological age i'd argue i needed more data but from my perspective it's encouraging that it didn't get worse and um yeah so um how does this you know basically flattening of aging at least for a two year period how does this compare with other interventions so um i've had it i made a video on this um in terms of calorie restriction impacting biological age and they didn't look at levine's phenotypic gauge calculator they used a different biological age calculator that was mostly derived from uh clinical biomarkers uh uh that are in the blood so it's just they used a similar approach so uh starting from baseline there was no difference in biological age for the two groups uh ad lib where they ate whatever they you know their normal diet uh and then cr calorie restriction uh so uh and this was a 12 month uh and 24 month up to 24 months people were on calorie restriction so what i want to highlight is after one year of the study the ad-lib group who was eating their normal diet had an increase in biological age of 0.7 years so one chronological year passed they had 0.7 years of biological aging in contrast the cr group and this was a 14.5 percent calorie restriction compared to their baseline diet they only saw a 0.1 year increase in their biological age now note that the shaded blue uh um region on the bottom is um where the triangles are that's the confidence interval for the uh range of the effect of cr on biological age so in other words uh most people well the average was a 0.1 year decrease in biological age but some were a little bit higher than that and some were a little a little bit lower so it's within the realm of possibilities that some people on cr after one year had zero biological aging based on the the you know clinical biomarkers in blood as the metric so similarly that's that's essentially what happened to my data over that one year period so was i on the obvious question would be is was i on cal restriction uh during 2020 when compared with 2019 so here's my daily calorie intake and in addition to regular blood testing i uh weigh all of my food every day i've been doing this for five years five plus years since april of uh 2015 uh and i track macros and micros i have data you know in an excel file for uh more than 2000 days with macros and micros and and it wasn't until about two years ago that i thought hey i should start tracking actual food intake as an additional measure above and beyond macros and micros because breaking down food into hey it's got these macros and micros may not represent the whole impact that food can have on health so here we see daily calorie intake and again i weigh everything with a food scale for 2019 and black and 2020 in red so each dot corresponds to one day of data so this is full data for two years uh daily calorie intake and what we can see is that in 2019 my average daily calorie intake was 2700 2703 calories a day whereas in 2020 it was uh 2 500 2587 calories per day now using a t-test we can see if these two groups of data are uh different statistically uh different or the same and uh based on the t-test uh we can see that there was a small but significant reduction in calorie intake from 2019 to 2020 uh 4.3 percent with a statistically significant p-value of uh 0.003 so there was a very mild calorie restriction i i basically had a very mild calorie restriction from uh 2020 when compared with 2019. So the obvious question is is a relatively small cr enough to slow or stop year-to-year biological aging so uh based on this data i'd argue that is possible and it's actually encouraging because uh the cr study that i posted on the previous slide where they had something like 14 cr to see basically a very low increase in biological age uh uh one year into that study um my data would argue that it doesn't have to be a 14 or so reduction in calories to see an improvement in biological age it could be as low as 4.4 percent um but i'd argue that many variables may be able to impact biological age so what could those be so were there fitness improvements now um besides things like muscle strength which are essentially the same and i'll probably post some you know fitness updates pull-ups et cetera uh over the next few weeks um uh two metrics of of my fitness are uh related to cardiovascular health wrestling heart rate and heart rate variability so i also wear a fitness tracker that tracks those measures so did i dramatically improve in fitness for rhr resting heart rate and hrv or was it about the same how does that impact biological age so here's again two years of data i've been tracking uh these variables for more than two years so this is uh two full years of data 2019 and 2020 for resting heart rate uh rhr on the top and heart rate variability hrv on the bottom so first i'm looking at uh uh wrestling heart rate on the in the top my average wrestling heart rate in 2019 was 48.8 beats per minute bpm and i slightly improved that in 2020 uh reducing it down which is going in the right direction um to 48.1 beats per minute and then using a t-test we can see that those those two groups of data are actually significantly different now i said that go going uh reducing a resting heart rate is going in the right direction but it's also important to note that a resting heart rate decreases during aging so one way we can uh ascertain if that's a fitness improvement related improvement for wrestling heart rate or an aging related uh a decrement for you know so going in the wrong direction it's basically a weaker heart now um is by assessing heart rate variability and i actually made a video about this the combination looking at the combination of resting heart rate and heart rate variability for uh um assessing cardiovascular uh health in a separate video and if you're interested you know click on the right corner you can you can access that video so uh how did my heart rate variability change during this two year period so we can see here uh purple 2019 and orange 2020 and uh although it wasn't significantly different the two these two groups of data my heart rate variability slightly went up from about 56 milliseconds uh to about 58 milliseconds uh in 2020 and it this uh the that small improvement was closed uh statistical significant [music] in the resting heart rate and the heart rate variability was actually going up and not down one could argue that my metrics of cardiovascular health didn't get worse at best they stayed approximately the same which is interesting because biological age stayed approximately the same so i'd argue that one reason for why my biological age essentially stayed the same year over year from 2019 to 2020 is because i was able to main maintain my cv related to my cardiovascular uh related health in terms of rhr and hrv at approximately the same levels 2019 into 2020. Now there's a third component uh going further into the diet side of this is my uh is my drive towards precision nutrition and what i mean by precision nutrition is you know within a whole food diet it's easy to say eat real food and exercise but within a whole food diet what pattern actually translates into having the best metrics of of health and actually minimizing disease risk and potentially maximizing longevity that's one of my goals so i'm just going to use c reactor protein here as an example so my range for crp in 2020 over six measurements was from 0.3 to 1.01 milligrams per liter so going forward with the goal of keeping my biological age as youthful as possible how can i get lower is better for crp so how can i get consistently closer to 0.3 on all of my measurements and you know avoid the 0.84 and 0.53 the higher measurements so as i mentioned using a an attempt at getting closer to a precision nutrition approach can altering my diet composition impact c-reactive protein so one way i can assess that is by looking at correlations between parts of my diet with crp so let's start with total calories and carbohydrates so how does crp correlate with those variables uh so crp in my data uh over um about 12 measurements um is not i've only i only started measuring crp in the past two years or so since morgan levine's biological age calculator came out and i wanted to use that data to calculate biological age i wish i had measured it more often earlier so uh crp in my data not is not significantly correlated with total calorie or carbohydrate intake but not all carbohydrates are the same carbohydrates include fiber which are polysaccharides starch which are disaccharides and simple sugars which are monosaccharides and i raised this point because because all carbohydrates are not the same each of these will you know may impact c-reactive protein in different ways but yet they're lost in looking uh you know their effects may be blunted if you're going to combine them all into just one measure as carbohydrates so let's have a look at those data so how does crp correlate with fiber total fructose and then remaining carbohydrates which are simple sugars but also could be disaccharides so crp in my in my data is not significantly associated with fiber with total fructose intake which is fructose but also the sum of of uh sucrose divided by two since sucrose is uh contains fructose as half of it um so crp not associated with fiber or fructose but what about the remaining carbohydrates so carbohydrates minus fiber and minus fructose and interestingly in this situation we see that the higher my simple carbohydrate intake that's not fiber fructose the higher my crp so if my goal is to reduce crp if i keep my simple sugar and potentially disaccharide intake at the lower end of this range i should see if that's playing a causative role on impacting crp i should expect to see lower crp levels consistently lower crp levels and i should mention that the correlation coefficient for my simple carbon intake with crp was very strong at 0.85 so um and i'll this that i'll raise that up that'll become important again in another in a few slides so keep that in mind that very strong correlation between my simple carbon intake with c-reactive protein so if i cut my simple carb intake will calories some protein or fat make up the difference so first in looking at the correlation for crp with protein protein is not significantly correlated so what a fat uh so just looking at total fat intake we can see that a significant correlation and inverse correlation so the higher my fat intake uh that that's correlated with a lower c-reactive protein so if my goal is to keep crp closer to 0.3 i should shoot for at least based on extrapolation of this data i should shoot for it you know somewhere in 110 grams of fat per day but note that also all fat is not the same so what's uh fat is comprised of monounsaturated fats mufa uh polyunsaturated fats which again all polyunsaturated fats are not the same they include omega-3 and omega-6 which are different fatty acid structures and also saturated fatty acids so all fat is not the same so uh first mufa monounsaturated unsaturated fatty acids are not significantly correlated with crp what about omega-3 and omega-6 those two are not significantly correlated with c-reactive protein but then interestingly right at that border of statistical significance zero uh p equals 0.05 we see that what's likely driving the correlation with crp is my saturated fat intake now going further all saturated fats are not the same now my main sources of saturated fats are mostly from cocoa beans i make my own chocolate i mix cocoa beans i grind them up and mix them with dates it's delicious it's like the best chocolate i've ever had uh so cocoa beans full fat yogurt which the two of them are mainly long chain saturated fatty acids uh 16 carbon and 18 carbon fatty acids but also coconut butter which contains mostly medium chain fatty saturated fatty acids from eight to twelve carbons uh in length for for those fatty acids so what's the correlation for crp with those foods so for cocoa beans then that there is no there isn't a significant correlation with c-reactive protein what about full-fat yogurt again uh no significant correlation with c-reactive protein what about coconut butter so here actually we can see a close to significant correlation for coconut butter with with c reactive protein in exactly the same direction as what we saw for total saturated fatty acids and for total fat intake um so that would suggest that by trying to get my coconut butter intake to somewhere around 50 grams per day i may consistently see low c-reactive protein levels at least based on the data on that on that graph so this data that i've shown may optimize c reactive protein but it's also important to yeah to see if making these changes or if these correlations are associated with changes in the other biomarkers on levine's biological age calculator because if i improve c-reactive protein by cutting my simple carb intake or increasing coconut butter if that alters levels of other things that collectively make my biological age worse while we're going in the wrong direction so we'll cutting fruit intake or including uh the 50 grams of coconut butter a day affect the other biomarkers so first i'm looking at coconut butter cb i've abbreviated it here correlations for coconut butter with with each of the other variables on levine's biological age calculator we can see that none of them are significantly different in other words increasing coconut butter based on the correlations uh is not significantly correlated with the other biomarkers so it's possible that i may increase my coconut butter and see changes in crp without changes in any of the other eight biomarkers that are on the test now it's important to keep an eye on rdw because the higher coconut butter is correlated with a higher rdw in my data and it's not significantly different the p-value is higher than 0.05 but it's close to significance so if i improve or if i'm able to keep my c-reactive protein somewhere around 0.3 or less with these changes that i've i've indicated but my rdw goes up i may want to think about making some other uh interventions to keep rdw low while also keeping crp low so what about my correlations with simple sugar intake with the other uh variables on the biological age calculator so this actually gets a little bit more complicated now remember a lower a lower simple sugar intake was correlated with a lower c-reactive protein which is where you would want it lower is better for c-reactive protein and i should mention i have a video for that too if you're interested in the crp video click on in the right corner so here we can see that having a higher simple sugar intake is actually correlated with lower glucose lower creatinine and lower white blood cells which are going in the actually the right direction in terms of aging and disease risk so it's possible that if i cut my simple sugar intake that may lead to increases in glucose creatinine and white blood cells which would then go in the wrong direction now conversely it seems that cutting my simple sugar intake would lead to lower levels of mcv since there's a positive correlation between mcv with my simple sugar intake so um but note that the correlations for each of these components with simple sugar intake is less than 0.5 or negative 0.5 which is considered a moderate or weak correlations and the reason i raised that issue is because if you remember the correlation for my simple sugar intake with c reactive protein was very strong at 0.85 so it's possible that by keeping my simple sugar intake low and again this is from whole foods this is not junk food i rarely eat junk foods a few times a year that i'm eating something like pizza or cookies or something like that it's possible that by keeping that low i'll keep my c-reactive protein low and because of the weaker correlations with simple sugar with the other variables on the biological age calculator that they may not end up becoming affected now that's my hope uh stay tuned in 2021 for further updates on my biological age to see if this actually ends up being true uh so that's all i've got for now uh thanks thanks if you made it to the end thanks and have a great day
