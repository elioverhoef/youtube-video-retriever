# Resisting An Increased Epigenetic Speed Of Aging (14-Test Results)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that the horvath clock is the best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age but don and pace may be the best epigenetic clock for predicting the epigenetic speed of aging and i covered this story uh in further detail in an earlier video so if you're interested in that it'll be in the right corner but for the guts of that story we can see that here on the y- axis we've got the change in donita pace so the change for the epigenetic speed of aging and then there are two groups al is ad lib people who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and then cr so in this study this was a 12% calorie restriction human calorie restriction study for 2 years and then there were three time points baseline 12 and 24 months after starting the intervention and what we can see is that people who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted had a had an increase a significant increase in their epigenetic speed of aging at both the 12 and 24mon time points were compared with people who were on 12% calorie restriction who had a slower epigenetic pace of aging as measured by the and pace now the importance of that finding is that other gold standard epigenetic clocks including horvath but also dna methylation the dna methylation version of pheno ag and grim age were not associated with an epigenetic age reduction for people on cr for 2 years which highlights the need and pace as potentially the best clock for for measuring the epigenetic speed of aging so with that in mind a major goal of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible even down to the molecular level which is what epigenetic ch changes are indicative of so with that in mind what's my data as i now have 14 tests so for the most recent blood test that i have data which was on april 29th 2024 i sent blood to true diagnostic discount link in the video description if you want to measure the need and pace on your own so for this test i got a donum pace value of 0.81 what does that mean 0.6 is the slowest epigenetic aging rate in contrast 1.4 is the fastest epigenetic aging rate so a 0.81 is on the right side of this equation relatively slower epigenetic aging but the goal is to get to the slowest rate of epigenetic aging which is around 0.6 so i've got some work to do somewhat good news but still some work to do now as i i mentioned for many biomarkers it's important to not get too high or too low but to look at year-to-year changes for full context so with that in mind this is just one test let's take a look at all test data since i started tracking this in 2022 as again i have 14 tests as shown here so when i first started tracking over three tests in 2022 average d need and pace was 0.84 and then over 8 tests in 2023 0 0.80 so a little bit better and then after the first three tests in 2024 about the same as 2023 so far 0.81 so what we can see from these 14 tests at worst is that dedan pace is mostly stable now that might not be impressive you know it's not 0.6 but d and pace increases during aging so resisting an age related change especially an increase is a small win and we can see that age related increase for den and pace in this plot now this is true diagnostic true diagnos plot so there probably is some healthy user bias going on where people who are using this test are already generally healthy nonetheless we can see that d and pace increases or the epigenetic speed of aging using this test increases during aging as indicated by the red arrow and with the need and pace values on the y- ais chronological age on the x and then we can see that my data point at 0.81 most recently is below the average for my chronological age so a slower speed of epen itic aging relative to the population average for someone of my chronological age so in terms of dan and pay's goals they are to achieve a 0.6 consistently achieve 0.6 the slowest epigenetic aging rate but also to resist the age related increase so so far i've got one of these that is in good news it's checked but the other i haven't yet optimized that so how can i get it down to 0.6 and also obviously i want to resist the age related change too so if for those who are unfamiliar with the channel after every test i calculate correlations with diet and i detailed that full approach in the last video so i'll put that in the right corner if you want to check it out so for this test i evaluated 103 comparisons for foods macro and micronutrients against dun and pace with the top half of those correlations shown here and note that the full list for correlations all correlations with biomarkers are on the correlations tier on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out all right so what we can see in the middle is the lowercase r that's the correlation coefficient and on the right we've got the p value so less than 0.05 being a nominally significant assoc uh correlation and unfortunately though we can see that nothing is significant using a p value cut off of 0.05 the closest is vitamin b6 at a p value of 0.08 so would see i'm out of luck for the next test as i don't have any significant correlations with diet to drive the next inter vention to try to improve the need and pace so for now the plan is to just collect more data i tested eight times in 2023 i'm thinking about testing at least 10 times in 2024 to get as much data as soon as possible to have more correlations to potentially have enough data so that i can make further improvements all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for ep genetic testing at home metabolomics ned quantification or microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea dieet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die ching brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the videos description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
