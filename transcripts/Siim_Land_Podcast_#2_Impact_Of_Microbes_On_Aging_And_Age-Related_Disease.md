# Siim Land Podcast #2: Impact Of Microbes On Aging And Age-Related Disease

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

There's an increased prevalence of not just bacteria but also fungi and viruses these microbes have been found that it increased prevalence in alzheimer's patients compared to age match controls who died at this you know the same age michael welcome back to the show hey scene thanks for having me back yeah like uh last time we had such a very you know great talk about many aspects of aging and yoga experiments and a lot of the fundamentals but we forgot or we didn't have time to talk about your book which talks about the microbial burden of aging so like how the micro microbiome and guttail contributors to aging which i think many people you know haven't really thought about before it's definitely like a more let's say new concept for many people so yeah it's very exciting to have you back and talk about what it is and what can people do you know to optimize their health and longevity so we can start you know what does it mean like the microbial burden of aging that is the title of the book yeah so uh i should backtrack the easy definition is uh the accumulation of microbes and or microbial products in places that they shouldn't be that accumulate during aging but i should say i didn't start off in the microbiome space like my background my undergrad my phd it's not an uh immunology or microbiology i didn't start off there but in my metabolomic studies in people older and younger adults i started to see in in my publications i started to see gut bacterial metabolites that were associated with muscle mass and function so back then the gut muscle axis the impact of the gut microbiome on muscle mass muscle function etc that really wasn't a thing you know 2014 2013. So uh the why behind it the why and how could microbes impact muscle uh or potentially impact muscle so that got me thinking and and as i started to dive deeper into the book then that expanded from not just the gut microbiome on muscle but got kidney gut brain i mean got everything right and not just gut but then the skin microbiome which changes during aging.oral microbiome which some of that is linked with alzheimer's so as i dove uh deeper and deeper yeah it just all came together and it's funny too the book i published you know a couple of times uh 2015 uploaded a new version 2016 a couple new versions so i took a look last night just to refresh my memory and it holds up pretty well you know seven years later so um so yeah gotcha yeah so uh yeah there's there's a lot of things we can you know start with and you know the microbiome itself is here like you said so vast and there's like microbien everywhere so like what what is what are the things that you know what is the burden about like what is the things that accumulated and like what is the negative effect on the launcher that you mentioned alzheimer's so like how does a microbiome contribute to alzheimer's or like other asian diseases yeah so the there's a few factors that are going on one is uh a worsened gut barrier function during aging so stuff that's in your colonic lumen is supposed to stay there and it's not or poop it out it's not supposed to be able to leak into the blood now if some of those things leak into the blood whether they're microbial dna or microbes themselves or some of their microbial metabolites that can trigger an immune activation immune activation being chronically bad for our systemic health so that's one way that microbes can adversely affect uh our health but in the book i even took it deeper into into all of the hallmarks of aging at the time there were nine hallmarks of aging and it's funny because i remember uh you know aubrey degray was talking about at a conference um you know fixing x y and z as components of aging and that will you know improve health spend and all these things and that was when the hallmarks of aging were only nine of them and i was like there's there's no microbial component how are you ignoring at least 50 percent of the story so now i'm sure you know it's the hallmarks have been updated to include microbial dysbiosis so um so that's one way in terms of um oral microbiome and outside alzheimer's disease in the brains of people who've had alzheimer's it's um there's an increased prevalence of not just bacteria but also fungi and uh viruses not in the same study sometimes in the same study but in different studies these microbes have been founded at increased prevalence in alzheimer's patients compared to age match controls who died at this you know the same age so while it doesn't show causation this shows that there's something going on there with microbes in the brain and potentially in alzheimer's patients so um where are they coming from are they coming from the gut some can come from the gut but others like uh pigeon devalis can come from the oral microbiome so um the good news is these things can be tracked just like we do they can be tracked i i've tested my own microbiome i think i don't know five or six times maybe seven looking for p gingivals and other microbes that have been implicated in things like cardiovascular disease and other stuff um and then you know finding the tricks to bring them down without killing off the quote-unquote good ones that's a little more complicated but um yeah they're everywhere we're at least 50 microbial so uh just to add a little bit more to the story you know so many people are talking about all of these human genes you know as a as potential you know so mtor pathway and ampk but the fact is we're an integrated bio you know a symbiosymbiotic organism right so sure maybe you impact mtor and bring it down but what's the impact on the gut microbiome and is that overall effect net positive right so uh i try to think about everything in that you know whole organism context gotcha yeah i mean there's so many bacteria inside of us and some of them are good some of them are bad and i guess it's you know the balance is still the kind of key like a balanced microbiome and you know there's something you you need like as i understand then like you know everyone every one of us has a little bit of this candida which is a very common like a yeast infection or you know thing that is associated with some negative health effects but you can't really like be completely without the candida either so this kind of comes down to like the balance between the good good microbes and the bad microbes so there are things we can do along those lines and um i think some of it goes to understanding just for example like gut physiology right so in the colon which is the portion before you poop out you know poop uh it should be acidic so with age the colon actually loses some of its acidity and becomes more basic now when the colon is acidic that limits the growth of these quote unquote bad ones just throwing out some names like enterobacteria and further subdividing under enterobacteria would be things like are commonly known of as quote-unquote bad ones like e coli or clebes yellow pneumoniae so when colonic acidity is uh goes in the wrong direction in terms of more basic it can allow for the growth of these potentially pathogenic bacteria to grow and things like e coli increase during aging in the colon so and actually blood stream infections with e coli also increasing the blood i think it's in the book i cited it was like 10 to 15 fold higher when compared with younger people so they're coming from somewhere if they're over you know over abundant in the gut they'll be over abundant in the blood at some point so all right so how do you acidify the colon and one of the big things that i show in the book is that uh soluble fiber high soluble fiber diets which kind of ties back into our our first talk right was a high cycle fiber diets that's converted by um gut bacteria into these short chain fatty acids so short chain fatty acids are fats there's fats with uh you know two to six carbon carbons but they're acids right so in very high amounts they acidify the colon and um now there aren't rcts that prove this but these are this is like the accumulation of a variety of in vitro studies and some extrapolation but in vitro high levels of the short chain fatty acids bring down levels of these anterior bacteria which increase during aging so the problem is as i'm sure you know most people don't eat fiber at all let alone much soluble fiber just a couple grams a day if that so um you know our intestines and immune system can do only so much to hold these you know uh mechanisms in check for so long and then eventually the dam breaks and it's the slow you know the slow march to death so that's one thing we can do to optimize gut barrier function is eat more fiber especially soluble fiber which is abundant in in vegetables or non-starchy vegetables and that will help there's an abundance of evidence that the short chain fatty acids improve gut barrier function as one way to prevent these suckers from getting into our blood and activating immune systems so um so that's one way but there's a variety of ways to do it that doesn't have to be the only way some in the keto crowd come at me and the car crowd and they're like look at my immune markers now and i don't need any fiber so but for most people probably fiber is going to be the way there may be some you know extreme situations where uh other thing has to work because of autoimmune issues or whatever it may be um yeah yeah that's that's for sure so like the ketone bodies butyrate that can also like like substitute for the fiber in some ways if i'm not mistaken then so that's an interesting thing because it there is some positive data on uh hydroxybutyrate and and keto butyrate but can you supplement the can you can which will you make more of if you have 25 grams of soluble fiber in your diet every day from whole food uh how much butyrate will you make and then can you get an equivalent of that equivalent amount of that from either a keto diet or butter has butyrate you know from these it's it's in limited amounts in foods it's exclusive exclusively produced by gut bacteria so the question is can you supplement can you design a diet without fiber to get high levels of butyrate and other short chain fatty acids to possibly possibly impact health i'm not sure there's very little data on that but for me what makes the most sense is uh is the soluble fiber i mean you're gonna like i said you're gonna increase the growth of bacteria that degrade the the fiber which will make short chain fatty acids and then that will acidify the colon so um yeah yeah and you know you have to also look at the outcome outcome studies basically like epidemic epidemiology studies you know they're still they have their flaws but uh if people who eat fiber generally have you know better health markers than uh yeah you know it's still a higher quality of evidence than like petri dish in a lot of ways sure right so what you're saying is if the evidence was that eating a very high fiber diet was bad for health overall you'd expect to see it at least epidemiologically and there's no i mean granted there are some isolated cases like i see people who will throw uh studies like people who have diverticulitis eating a high fiber diet doesn't do anything and they'll say see fiber is useless yeah maybe if you have diverticulitis but on average in very large studies people who eat more fiber low you know lower risk of all-cause mortality kidney disease etc you know you go down the list so yeah and uh you know i guess these studies they still control for the healthy user bias at least to a certain extent like you can't obviously control it 100 but uh because you know there is disassociation of people who eat more fiber generally are healthier they exercise they sleep more they keep a better body composition and those kind of things but uh you know the studies actually do control for those variables uh to a large degree so that's a great point because it isn't just fiber that can increase the short chain fatty acids there are a few studies that have shown exercise training in rcts can increase uh short chain fatty acids in the gut so um how that mechanism happens is still being sorted out you know but um and that actually if you go back to some cross-sectional studies athletes have been shown to have higher levels of short chain fatty acids there are other studies that have shown positive associations between like butyrate and higher vo2 max which it's either cause or consequence the training is causing more bacterial uh butyrate production or they're like you said healthy user bias maybe they're just getting more soluble fiber it could be a little bit of both or it could just be training um but it there there are potentially compensatory mechanisms that don't involve fiber at all that could be just exercise training getting a boost in the short chains to maximize gut berry function but the caveat to that is there may be some u-shaped association there because um a very extreme uh you know i don't want to say extreme but um ultra marathons and ultra endurance athletes there is some evidence that uh post race they'll have elevated lps and blood for example lps being lipopolysaccharide which is found on the outer membrane of bacteria it's an exclusive bacterial metabolite so that it's increased in blood suggests it leaked from the gut or somewhere and um so basically ultra marathoners or ultra endurance athletes too much exercise like way beyond the threshold of a physiological regular amount increased gut barrier leak and then more lps in the blood so you know what's that it goes back to what's that optimal training zone where you get peak short chain fatty acid production peak gut barrier function optimized immune defense and all of that so yeah like too much of exercises obviously still not that beneficial but uh what are the like other things that let's say break down the gut barrier so you mentioned the acidity or the low acidity and certain like microbes contribute to that but like you know what is with age you see that that declines and people not eating enough the short chain fatty acids are not getting enough of those so but uh yeah like what is the other things that contribute to that uh so the short chains are the primary things but there are things like um intestinal alkaline phosphatase so alkaline phosphatase is a protein that most people know of in blood alp on a standard test uh but alp is also in the intestines so iap so there are data showing that iap improves gut barrier function so how can you and i should say too iap over expression in mice extends lifespan and then it's been shown i think in diabetic patients overweight diabetic patients where if you feed them iap it improves glycemic status so it's a potentially important protein in the gut so how can you trigger or increase expression of that protein and there are other things that can do it besides a fiber and butyrate or butyrate potentially coming from fiber and exercise training things like vitamin k1 which but then again you're gonna it's it's found in green leafy vegetables but in in vitro studies vitamin k1 increases expression of iap and then there are other things like vitamin d that can increase it so there are a few other little tricks that you know we can try to boost things that can improve gup area function outside of exercise training and outside of high soluble fiber diet but the like things like diabetes or just uh metallic syndrome or heart disease or those things do those uh accelerate that process the degradation or is it the chicken or the egg which comes first is it poor guy functions stuff leaks into the blood now you've got microbes in you know in the uh in the carotid arteries and intima and then you get immune activation and the macrophages come and make foam cells there is some evidence you know some hypotheses generated off of finding microbes in plaques right so um i i probably lean towards microbes are causing some aspect of that uh yeah is there a way to test like their intestinal barrier function or like is there a way to like measure how degraded it is or how functional it is yeah i i wish i could say that there were good ways to do that there are ways that are purported to do it like one way is by measuring uh levels of a protein known as zonulin in blood this is pretty common um but there are some published studies showing that zion may not be a marker of gut barrier function but instead of immune activation because it it's been uh mischaracterized as one of the complement proteins i think c3 or related to that but still that you would have so zomulins found in the type junctions that are in gut epithelial that connect got epithelial cells to form some of the barrier so you would find that in blood suggests a leaky uh you know a leaky gut right but um even if that's not what it's actually uh even if that's been mischaracterized as not being a gut barrier protein if it's one of the complement proteins that you have something that's supposed to be in the gut that is immune activation that too is a bad sign but um there are things like the breath test like the lactulose and i think uh sucralose or sucrose but that's more of a small intestine kind of issue um the lps lipopolysaccharide is also another way where finding that in blood but the assay used to measure lps is in great it suffers from a lot of variability and lps in the blood can be bound to lipoproteins like ldl hdl so what's circulating in the blood may not actually reflect how much is there but if you have very high levels of lipoproteins that could be a sign of having lps in the blood um also with lps um as i mentioned alkaline phosphatase alp so alp is a very important role not just in the intestine but if it's in the blood it dephosphorylates lps which can inactivate it making it easier to get rid of so i think in indirect way is if your levels of alkaline phosphatase are above around 48 which is lowest all-cause mortality risk in a meta-analysis of like 9 million people if it's higher than 48 which from my experience most people are um that could be a sign that you've got higher lps but still that's very indirect you know and speculative so the the and then there's another way of lipopolysaccharide binding protein which circulates in blood so if that's relatively elevated then potentially you have high lps and the lps has come from somewhere whether it's mouth skin gut so there are some ways but uh none of them are great unfortunately are there any symptoms people experience yeah i mean it would be what you would expect for an infection right you know malaise fatigue uh but the how do you separate that versus like you know viral infection or a fungal infection you know i looked into like uh so even studying the blood microbiome because it can go beyond lps it doesn't have to be lps so in terms of bacteria you've got gram-negative bacteria gram-positive bacteria lps are are only found in gram-negative bacteria so now you've got a whole other class of bacteria that aren't represented by that measurement but then even still you've also got fungi that can leak into the blood and viruses and and archaea all kinds of different you know taxonomy that can leak into the blood so unfortunately the blood microbiome even measuring that can be a challenge because there can be contamination from everywhere like in the reagents reagents used to assay the the thing on your on the gloves on the tips it can be everywhere so even so in terms of the blood microbiome outside of lps you know there have been studies that show associations with cardiovascular disease and diabetes and all of these things um but then there are other studies that show that there's no blood microbiome it's only a transient effect whether it translocates from the mouth like someone doing a dental procedure you can find microbes in the blood after a dental procedure uh so there's other stuff so so it's still being debated on that but there are companies that do whole genome sequencing which is basically gold standard um but as far as i know not commercially available i'd love to have my full blood microbiome sequence where it's everything you know bacteria viruses um fungi and in and seeing how that changes during age and what we can do to minimum is that but the good thing is also indirectly you'd expect that if you had uh some amount of microbial dna or microbes in the blood that your immune system should be activated so if you've got you know so we can look at things like total white blood cells or even the distribution of neutrophils lymphocytes monocytes high sensitivity c-reactive protein which is going to be released in reaction to uh infection or some kind of immune activation by microbes uh so there are ways to kind of get a picture of our microbial burden status but the tricky part is and i think this is going to be the 21st century and beyond of of investigation is what do you do if you've got intracellular viruses or intracellular infections are they recognized systemically how would they be recognized systemically like i'd imagine your systemic biomarkers could be good in blood but if you've got an increased burden of cells that are infected by viruses that the viruses are latent and these cells are somewhat less functional or dysfunctional how would you how do you detect intracellular so there to me i think there's a big uh you know once the science gets to investigating the intracellular infections which could be some relation to autoimmunity like why would you you're i'm going on a long long ass ramp but why would why would our body selectively kill its own cells for no reason like there's got to be some reason you know so one reason could be you know intracellular infection and the body tries to get rid of it because they're infected with something right so but the evidence on that is very scant it's still a very burgeoning field so but i i bet on that going forward in in the future yeah that's super interesting uh but yeah you know like you mentioned that if you have like high neutrophils or high crp then it probably reflects that there might be some infection you know and because of the end like we said already just because there is some microbes like and like lps or some other viruses or something it doesn't necessarily mean they become pathological uh it's there's like you know like a burden is what matters like how big the burden is and how it's going to affect the other biomarkers and stuff like that so if there is something it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to like cause any like adverse effects to your health if that makes sense in the short term i'd agree with that but how long do you have to have things in your blood or in your cells and tissues that stimulate this immune response what's the time duration that you need to have that where it now becomes a chronic problem and if you think about there's probably going to be you know the yin and the yang of systemic health transient insult whether it's gut barrier leak you know gut barrier leak can even happen after eating a very high fat meal like that's been published so now you've got some microbes in the blood or microbial products immune system activated very transiently clears it out system systemic homeostasis so i'd imagine it's not a perfect system right so you know even on a petri dish if you have some antibiotic and you kill off 99.9 something percent of it and that 0.0001 survives that bacteria may have antibacter anti anti microbial resistance or or resistant genes right so now it proliferates and now you can't kill it with the same antibiotic you got to use something else so i'd imagine that's there's something similar going on where with any transient gut leap we may not get rid of all of it and some amount of that can get all over our body and over time systemically accumulates and then we hit that threshold of we we're we're mostly carrying this you know this pathological burden and you know the scales get tipped and now it's that slow march towards death where nothing we can do can really eradicate it so so even like a single meal single meal could like trigger or set a fire to some sort of this microbial cascade eventually in multiple years yeah but most of us get rid of you know whatever transient uh you know um translocation into the into the blood what very quickly in almost all of it but even that small amount that's left you leave that one person alive in the in the village that murdered your family and they come back 20 years later and murder all of everybody else right so uh now that's too a lot of what i'm saying there is evidence to support it i wouldn't say it if it wasn't true but you know just the idea that a few microbes can proliferate and and hang out in cells and stay there for decades and cause some aspects of aging this isn't this isn't uh you know a widely accepted thing this is just my speculation based on the published evidence whether that will be borne out in the future we'll see uh but i'm not going to wait 50 years for academia to sort it out when there's an abundance of evidence that already leans that way like for example even suggesting that alzheimer's has a microbial component um that's been going on you know 10 20 years and there is emerging evidence that comes out year after year that that is the case but yet you still have people who are going after the non-microbial aspects of it like let's get rid of the plaques you know let's treat it with this drug that has nothing to do with microbes um and all these clinical trials are failing because they're probably not addressing the root of the problem which may have some microbial components so um yeah are there like any you know let's say you're eating so other like anything is to minimize the let's say leaking into the bloodstream of the microbes and one of the things that definitely like promote the leaking so like are there any food groups or any like cooking preparation methods or like uh whatever kind of other things that cause that well so i i talked about like that high soluble fiber diet and exercise training and vitamin d vitamin k but the other side of that is the western diet high fat high sugar no no fiber in animal studies this has been shown in in part that bacterial dysbiosis that i talked about so the short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in the gut go down the short chains in the gut go down an increase of these enterobacteria like e coli um negatively affecting muscle mass muscle health so uh yeah the western diet is abysmal um so and what's interesting too is that there is evidence that fat cells produce antimicrobial peptides so if if the not if but when considering that the western diet impairs gut the area function potentially a greater leak of stuff into the blood immune activation well immune function declines during aging and fat mass increases during aging so that fat fat cells can reduce antimicrobial peptides that suggests that in some people who may have weakened immune systems the fat expansion is a potential way to compensate for reduced gut barrier function and reduce immune immune cell function so i put that data in the book too especially in terms of the antimicrobial peptides that they produce so then i've had people say well does that mean i should accept getting fat with age right so i don't know that that's the case either i mean ideally we want to stay lean keep our immune systems as healthy and functional as possible and if we see fat mass start to increase maybe investigate what's going on with immune immune cell function right so yeah it's a compensation if it is a compensation mechanism then it's you know you're is it like a trade-off still so yeah but um you mentioned the alzheimer's like how do the microbes affect alzheimer's risk and what's the connection there yeah so probably the biggest one is p gingivalis which is found in the mouth and i think that's uh the oral microbiome is probably most people don't don't think about it at all i mean even when i go to the dentist and they do a cleaning and whatever else they have to do and i start asking asking them questions how can i optimize my oil microbiome i get glossy looks by these are health professionals who study the mouth as for a living and you know operate on it so um you know then the question is how do you optimize the oral microbiome and some of that links in well actually probably most of it links into dot into diet um so nitrates in the mouth are beneficial and uh nitrates are things that are you would be at least in vegetable containing foods not in processed meats you wouldn't want that because they they don't come with the same beneficial compounds that are in things like beets or greens but nitrates have been shown to act as basically a prebiotic actually a shouldn't say have been shown this too is in vitro we're on the cutting edge of the science where the the studies in people yet haven't been done but in vitro nitrate acts as a prebiotic to basically favor the growth of the quote-unquote good ones and reduce the levels of things like uh p gingivalis and other others like tannerella forsythia fusive bacteria that have been found in the brain's valsimer's patients now would eating a high nitrate diet lots of beets lots of greens which have other health effects outside of people or microbiome blood pressure potentially ergogenic in terms of improving muscle performance and and stuff related to that um would that reduce alzheimer's risk again no data i have to you know keep it fair and keep it honest you know but i think it's an easy bet to make you know if you add these things or people add these things into their diet you potentially get that benefit and potentially minimize that risk whereas not having it at all i'd imagine increasing risk now taking it even more precise than that though um just anecdotally for me for example i eat a very high nitrate diet i'm eating 200 grams of beets raw beets every day and i've measured my oral microbiome you know seven times five to seven times i don't remember off the top of my head i lost count but i do have bacteria in my mouth that shouldn't be there besides the p ginger ballast so you know that's a more i think the optimizing the gut is easier just because there's such a wealth of data on studying it whereas the oral microbiome and how to optimize that at least getting rid of potentially pathogenic ones outside of the nitrate story it's still a very emergent emergent feel but um yeah there is stuff we can do right optimizing diet there's definitely stuff we can do i wouldn't use antiseptic mouthwashes though that have quote-unquote antibacterial uh components because that that's been shown to kill off the good one the quote-unquote good ones in the mouth too potentially impacting things like blood pressure like having higher blood pressure in these antiseptic mouthwashes so if you're killing off the good ones i'd imagine it could be easier for the you know the the pathogenic ones to make it easier to get into the brain or the or you know the vasculature wherever it may be yeah yeah so yeah like this carpet bomb is not the answer and i i would imagine the same applause to the gut so like taking antibiotics is probably also not going to be the long-term solution there's also the skin there's also the skin microbiome which you haven't touched on and that too is you know there's so much there's so much on skin care products right that that there's no mention of the gut microbiome or sorry of the skin microbiome at all and probably all of us have a a different skin microbiome what i mean by that is the skin microbiome of the palms is different from the forehead it's different from the soles of the feet or the armpits so you know and even the skin ph in each of these areas which skin ph plays probably the major role in skin barrier function and maybe most people don't think skin barrier function is important but if you've ever seen like your grandma or grandpa with a sore on their face on their skin this is some dysbiosis on the skin that the skin tries to compensate you know uh by making that scab to try to kill off whatever's there so uh like my my grandmother would have these sores on her face from from what like so skin barrier functions skin ph is very important but even most soaps or what's sold as skin cleansers they don't put their ph values on the on the bars um so even how to optimize the skin microbiome that's still an emerging field um and that being said the skin care industry not even paying any attention to all right this is your skin microbiome these are the prebiotics you would need to have an optimal skin microbiome to keep it youthful and elastic we're on the cutting edge there too there's almost nobody doing you know stuff related to that yeah i would imagine like in a few years or something there's going to be like this transdermal skin uh probiotic or something that that is optimized for you know the best skin microbiome but yeah obviously we don't have anything like that at the moment but it would have to be uh site-specific because you know the armpits and the groin and the bottoms of the feet all different skin ph uh different microbiomes not exactly the same um so do you want to have like a higher ph or lower on the skin so skin ph is lower you want that to be around five and that increases during aging so um if i would use a skin care product like i would look to see actually what the you know the ph ph of it is and some of that info is in the book foreign so that's going to be complicated because you know the skin is dry you know i mean i mean the uh the product yep yep but then you know how many products you have to go through how much money do you have to waste right but then the other side of it is how much time do you have to invest to actually go digging for the skin ph which as i mentioned almost nobody is reporting that so um and then there are things we can do like for example um i've had skin cancer in the past i don't know if you guys can see it i have a scar here so that was a benign squamous cell carcinoma so that wasn't a problem they cut it out but um i just went to the skin doctor recently like two days ago because i've got some like darker spots on my back and uh it's fortunately not melanoma not even close but it's it's uh it's hard to say it's severagic semoragic keratosis anyway what that means is um it's like a benign tumor and but it's it's not melanoma which is the thing that can spread but the reason i'm raising this point is all right so i go to i ask them all right what can i do and they were like oh basically nothing laser it off which i'm not fixing the problem but doing a pubmed search there are things that that like a very high concentrations of urea urea has some antimicrobial effects it's a character uh it's a keratinolytic so it breaks up the keratin so you know i bought a 40 urea cream which is like a bomb of urea uh so there are things we can do to improve i haven't used it yet but i'm gonna put it on the spot and see if what's been shown in public studies can impact you know mine without the laser treatments but there are things we can do locally on our skin to optimize skin function uh skin health um but i prefer that targeted you know like like you were saying they're going to be optimal probiotics based on your skin microbiome and you know hey use this paste on your arms because of your microbiome and this is what it'll do it's only a matter of time yeah well that's super interesting but uh how do you keep the skin barrier intact so like collagen is obviously important for that other like any other foods or supplements or activities that keep the skin barrier uh in intact yeah there is some published evidence that links diet to skin health like carotenoids higher carotenoid diets being associated with less skin aging but uh beyond that uh i mean it still happens like i think i mentioned last time like my skin if someone looked at my skin someone actually commented like your eyes the skin the skin on your eyes is a little droopy so there is skin aging and my carotenoid intake i mean 50 milligrams of beta-carotene per day 25 milligrams lutein zeaxanthineum this is like 10x higher than most people get so uh there are but there is a component for a diet on that um in terms of other stuff i think um knowing that just for an example so skin ph should be five right now most soaps so my parents would buy like these soaps and stack them up and and like uh just without putting names on blast you know but um when i looked into what the ph of these soaps were ph eight all right so you hear ph8 you hear ph five you think oh it's not that different it's a ph of difference of three but ph is a log scale so that's a thousand-fold less acidic with the ph of eight in other words i'm basically stripping away my ph layer by using these soaps or that i did use these soaps um and you know when i use them as a kid um i'd feel like you know my skin got very dry and i didn't know anything i didn't know anything of it so um outside of diet and you know not eating you know junk food which i'd imagine wouldn't be good for skin health uh just i think a big part of it is knowing which factors can negatively impact it like skin soaps and cleansers that have ph is way too high trying to get stuff that's more close to physiological ph so the soaps or skin cleansers that i have now a ph of five like i make it a point to to go for that and actually my 14 year old you know she's into all kinds of healthcare products and i'm like you don't even know what you're putting on your skin you don't know any you know i try to get into the biochemistry and physiology of it which makes her frustrated because she's like i'm 14. I don't want to think about these things i'm not a scientist but looking into the cosmetic products to see what this what the ph is and and yeah again knowing that it's in the physiological range i think that's going to have more of a benefit relative to using these soaps and cleansers that have a ph way too high for skin ph um that can potentially strip the layer and you know impair the impaired the skin microbiome so so like if it's if your skin becomes too dry from using a certain let's say soap or shower gel or shampoo then it's two acidic or is it too alkaline two alkaline um and the skin can you know improve its ph just like you know antibiotics you do that and eventually it can come back the the gut microbiome can come back to its normal state but it takes time so if you're continually stripping off uh you know or or um you know alkalize alka alkalinizing your skin from these alkaline soaps it's just a continuous process of dry dry dry and then i'd imagine eventually skin damage a loss of elasticity um but the collagen story is an interesting one you know because it kind of goes into that diet component where you know uh you've got to degrade the collagen and then absorb it and then the component amino acids would have to go to skin where that they'd be reformulated into you know uh whether it's using the glycine or proline whatever it may be that would be good for skin health you know that's kind of the long journey to get there right so i'd imagine you know either topically applied or not applied in the case of the soaps and and cleansers that have too high of a ph uh that would probably be the best bet now you always hear dermatologists saying stay out of the sun but even that is you know that u-shaped curve because if you stay out of the sun you minimize vitamin d vitamin d is hugely important in in uh skin antimicrobial defense so if you're not in the sun at all i can't imagine that's going to be good yeah if you're eating vitamin d it's that same journey where it's got to get into the system and then out to the skin whereas we evolve to get get some amount of sun exposure you know pretty regularly so yeah so the the likes new irrigation has i guess like some antiviral effects as well yep erect dark like on the on the skin yeah but then the other side of that is too much right where you're now photo oxidizing and skin aging and i'm sure you've seen like the pictures of like truck drivers or a truck driver where this side of the face was exposed to the sun and you can see that you know wrinkles and everything else and the other side is less aged so yeah there but then what's the u-shape right so um or the bottom yeah i wanted to ask um about the mouthwash so like or and like the toothpaste like so obviously brushing your teeth is still better than not brushing your teeth so like are there like any specific uh toothbrush uh sort of like toothpastes that are better or like what do you think about fluoride in the toothpaste and those kind of things yeah so i do have fluoride so i'm sure i'm going to get a lot of criticism on this but i do have fluoride in my toothpaste i'm not swallowing it you know now granted some people can say some amount of that you will swallow and if i take it out okay sure i'll minimize risk completely but the other side of that is fluoride helps with mineralization of the teeth which declines during aging so do i want to have teeth with an increased risk for maybe cavity formation versus a little bit of it leaking i i can see the argument both ways there right so um i think what's optimal for toothpaste is is uh that too is the cutting edge and to be explored because uh it's probably highly individualistic there are probably things in in the every toothpaste whether it's the foaming agents or you know sodium lauryl sulfate but then the other side of that is using these quote-unquote natural products do you get as much you know is that good for the oral microbiome there are no studies on these things like there are no head-to-head matchups of toothpaste in terms of optimizing oral microbiome status and then even like looking at alzheimer's risk like there's just no studies you know um and how it would be hard to do too because even if you have a very large epidemiological study probably most people are using the standard toothpaste that are sold where very few people are using these quote-unquote more natural versions without the emulsifiers and whatever other additives so would you have a large enough you know uh intervention or you know uh uh a group compared to the standard toothpaste to see an effect on associations without sound disease so it's hard to say what the optimal is i've seen you know um some recommending just use no toothpaste and it's it's just the mechanical action of brushing that can help clear off the plaque and technically that won't affect your oral microbiome because you're not hitting it with any kind of reagents i mean there too i'd say the only way to know is to test you know uh but then who's really doing that because the oral microbiome testing get expensive and you have to do it basically every day to have enough data where you you know you do it without the toothpaste you do it with so i haven't done those experiments those are experiments i could do um you know because is toothpaste and it's even crazy to say is it even beneficial i mean i want to have fresh grass you know i don't want to have rancid breath you know so toothpaste toothpaste helps with that but you know it goes to that bigger question of what is optimal we can get a transiently fresh breath by brushing with the regular toothbrush but toothpaste but you know what is optimal long term for the oral microbiome there's just no data right so yeah i mean the regular so like the regular fluoride in the tooth paste i think i think there are studies showing that yeah like you only absorb like 0.1 milligram if you brush your teeth with the fluoride toothpaste and like you know the safety amount is still like significantly higher than that so yeah unless you're swallowing then it's very benign in terms of the actual health effects because yeah like you're not swallowing you're only like rinsing your teeth with it and you're washing with water out of it as well and uh yeah i should say i have a water filter that a fluoride is one of the things it takes out so i don't want that in my water supply if it is uh so try i try to cover that base but i hear you on not swallowing it right but kids little kids swallowing the toothpaste that don't listen to their parents so um um like mouthwash i think you have a mouthwash i've seen a video you're talking about your own uh proprietary blend of mouthwash yeah i've i've since modified it since then uh it because the oral microbiome as i was saying it's for me right now harder to optimize relative to the gut so yeah i started off with uh basically a um physiological saline solutions to sodium bicarbonate in water and so we want it so in contrast with the skin which we want to be acidic and the gut which we want to be acidic the mouth ph is uh close to physiological uh systemic in terms of the blood 7.3 7.4 so you don't want an acidic mouthwash because that's going to accelerate cavity formation cavity formation accelerating below a ph of 5.5 so it's interesting how all these different niches gut skin mouth they're not all the same and actually that's another important point too because there are mouthwashes that have a ph that are either below 7.3 7.4 physiological ph or you know even higher which is rare you want the higher higher for the right so sodium bicarbonate it's going to alkaline alkyl i don't know why it's hard for me to say but alkalinized and amount so i started off with that and then i had a couple drops of peppermint oil in about a liter you know that homemade liter of water sodium my carbonate peppermint oil because peppermint oil has been shown to kill off p gingivals at least in vitro so i started with that and then i've had different interventions where i put xylitol in there xylitol can reduce uh streptococcus mutants which is a uh can cause cavities so i put xylitol in there but very low amounts one percent so one gram in 100 to 10 grams per liter but then i started take taking stuff out and not using the mouthwash seeing how it affected my oral microbiome uh putting things in clove oil other oils you know these essential oils uh putting berberine in the mouthwash to try to kill off some of these microbes that are linked with alzheimer's disease and you know it goes up the point of supplementation and testing berberine in my mouthwash was a disaster you know uh it sent stuff all over the place you know it looking like dysbiosis is not in a good way and i put very low concentrations of berberine in there based on published studies at least in vitro so my current approach is tongue cleaning which is the standard tongue cleaning flossing water pick actually and using a modified version of that mouthwash now with 10 xylitol only because uh relative to the one percent it's been shown to kill off serratia mascara senes however you say however you say it which for whatever reason in my microbiome or microbiome is either 95 or zero so i've got this tremendous variability in a microbe that uh most people don't have and xylitol very high doses have been shown to kill it off so the oral microbiome is still a work in progress you know it's it's uh conquer aging or die trying i've got to figure it out before i'm increasing my risk for whatever seradia can impair systemically but so far i don't see any systemic effect of it outside of just my mouth hopefully you know what about like oil pulling or something that yeah uh i've done that in the past but um i'm thinking about so there are some oils i'm thinking about taking coconut oil and mixing it with some of these essential oils that have been shown to kill off the serratia and kind of using that as a quote-unquote mouthwash not necessarily oil pulling i've used the oil pulling in the past but i didn't see any differences like on you know yellowing i didn't measure the microbiome so i really don't know um but even the oil pulling you know which which fat are you going to use are there certain fats that are going to be best for your oral microbiome as a group you know as a full you know full field uh you know doesn't affect the good ones kills off the bad ones you know should it be coconut oil should it be olive oil you know these are fatty acid different fatty acid profiles saturated versus monounsaturated should be a polyunsaturated like i've used flaxseed oil in the past as an oil pulling and that's a polyunsaturated omega-3 uh you know so even deciphering that it would take a lot of testing and they're just on our published studies you know so we have to realm into the self-experimentation and needing a lot of data to get to that you know but i'm on the case seven tests so far i'm gonna keep at it until i've you know got it optimized or i died trying so how do you test the oral microgram yeah it's just a saliva sample and then i send it to a company here in the states and they use whole genome sequence sequencing so you can get bacteria fungi i haven't seen viruses pop up in there yet which is good news but candida levels are low but uh yeah that one bacterium that's just a it's either there almost completely and i thought it was contamination i communicated with the you know the founders of the company and they were like look we almost never see this in anybody else and for whatever reason your data it's either incredibly abundant or not there at all so uh if it was a contamination issue i'd imagine everybody in their company or a lot more people would have it and that's not what they said but i'm not sure if it's a global thing you know uh there are global companies yet outside of the united states and maybe they ship outside of the united states i i don't know but uh whole june whole whole genome sequencing is the way to go i think uh you're not just getting bacteria you're getting potentially fungi and whatever else may be there so gotcha what do you think about these probiotic and fermented foods so like sauerkraut and pickles and other like do they have any positive effect on the microbiome and aging or what do you think yeah so so there's a couple things going on there one is whenever someone whenever i someone hears or whenever most people hear about optimizing the gut microbiome they say oh i eat fermented x y and z but the fact is you know it if people are eating fermented foods that's great there is some evidence that fermented foods can improve things like gut bacterial diversity so you have uh a larger group and more differences for the total bacteria that are there it's not just a group and very little diversity you have a lot of different stuff so but even bacterial diversity in the gut can follow u-shape where too little is bad but also too high which is found in kidney disease patients so there and then other other uh you know people will um there are some studies that have compared like inulin for example which is found in garland onions so very high inulin-based diets and compared that against like fermented foods or even probiotics and then the probiotics or fermented foods will come out on top you know in those studies like the sonnenberg lab has published some of those studies at stanford but the fact is to get like 30 grams of inulin or onions i mean this is almost impossible it's a completely it's like giving a mega bomb of drug you'd have to eat pounds upon pounds kilos of onions which there's no way physiologically we didn't evolve to do that so are there head-to-head studies of probiotics and fermented foods versus a high soluble fiber diet i haven't seen that yet now in terms of evolutionarily there probably were and again this goes on to that that that ledge of here's all the published evidence and now i'm starting to speculate what could be true or not right it's just my speculation evolutionarily we did have fermented foods in the diet right if we didn't eat for three days and we came across an apple tree and there were a few apples or maybe most of the apples on the floor that were half rotted and fermenting we probably ate them right so there is probably a role for fermented foods in the in the human diet but as the majority of our intake there's just no way and i i'd imagine that eating you know pounds of fermented foods probably isn't going to be good for human health so in small amounts i'd imagine going to be beneficial whether it's through probiotics that are in the foods themselves or some of the fermentation products whether it's lactate or whatever so i think fermented foods are our component it's just a matter of how much now the other aspect of it is too is uh i see people saying i supplement with x y and z probiotics so my gut health is good but even that is the sub-optimal approach but what i mean by that is i think the best approach is to actually uh study one's gut microbiome and to see which ones of the quote-unquote good ones are potentially missing and which ones are the potential bad ones quote unquote are elevated and then coming up with a strategy to you know optimize that towards you know youth and not dysbiosis so how do you do that right so in one study uh one research group the bindles group just using as an example they had mice in a cancer a cancer mouse model uh um so cachexia where they lose muscle mass and then controls uh with that were not that didn't have leukemia and they looked at the gut microbiome in both of those animal models and they found that the the leukemia animal model had lower levels of lactobacillus which is found you know in dairy and other stuff so and it was dramatically lower so they thought all right what will happen if we restore levels of lactobacillus in the cancer mouse model so they gave it as a probiotic and when they did they saw muscle mass increase uh so you know i i favor you know the um you know just like i do with all the systemic biomarkers that we talked about you know it's track identify demonstrated need come with come up with the mechanism and potential hypothesis for what can be used to optimize that biomarker and then treat it like that as opposed to the published studies show x y and z and other people and i'm just going to take it based on hope that it's going to do that for me so the same for the gut microbiome like identify potential weaknesses in your gut microbiome identify potential probiotics that you could take that could impact that or the dietary approach that can impact that and then do the experiment uh just as another example i've taken probiotics in the past using that approach like bifidobacteria which decline during aging and they cause some kind of gi issue where um like blood in the stool like uh it shouldn't be there which never happens otherwise uh so trying to restore levels of a bacterium that don't exist in my microbiome whether it was antibiotics as a kid or whatever but um it's not always easier said than done and then also just the the long long-winded uh story um some probiotics aren't coded in capsules properly to survive the acidity of the stomach so maybe they make it to the colon and they're just dead now can a dead micro a dead bacterium have positive effects systemically there is some evidence for that like pasteurizing acromancia does have health effects um but you want it to be alive and you wanted to be able to survive in your gut and be able to bloom whereas it can't do that if it's dead right it's it's just there so or you poop it out so a lot of factors involved with the probiotic story yeah and you know most of the probiotic supplements they're just you know random strains and random species that you know you don't necessarily know even if you need or if you have too much of it already or if it's yeah not suitable for your microbiome so yeah the first is probably to do like a microgram test and to see like what uh if there is some like imbalances or this biosis in there and then like supplement if needed the other side of this too is you mentioned ai and you know ai crunching the numbers for this targeted probiotic to skin there's got to be a way where we evolve society evolves towards that too for so you for the gut microbiome too and what i mean is you'll have a pre-existing gut microbiome composition and that composition they're making you know uh proteins they're making metabolites so it's not just who's there just looking at composition we'd also need to know what they're doing so having all of that information in in uh some kind of neural net or learning out machine learning algorithm and then you know the ai would be able to predict which probiotics should be able to improve your overall profile to make it a really a targeted approach um and even which ones could survive there you know but even then and then which prebiotics you would need in your diet to help keep them alive in that ecosystem because if you have a dominant strain you know that the giant redwood tree in the forest and you know there's a trillion of them and you and you just you know you supplement with one billion which is a thousand fold less is that one billion going to make a dent in that forest and that ecosystem relative to the trillion others that sister that's kind of the probiotic story and then if you take too many have you have you altered the balance of it so yeah eventually we'll get towards you know we'll get towards that more uh personalized but definitely not not there yet yeah i guess i feel like it's very hard to like manually try to i don't know like create the perfect microbiome like i feel like the microbiome is almost like the outcome of the kind of perfect lifestyle or like a perfect diet and stuff like that it's very hard to like reverse engineer or manually try to yeah create that ecosystem like that ecosystem is the kind of outcome of a perfect fit for your genetics and environment with your lifestyle and diet kind of yeah and so that's a great point because then it goes to the issue of if you don't pay the most attention to optimizing your gut microbiome would you see that reflected systemically right so that goes back into the idea of biomarkers because yeah i could add a probiotic or i could add x y z to try to optimize the gut microbiome but if i don't see systemic things or at least circulating things improving systemically what have i really done you know i'm just expensive supplements and i'm not positively impacting change so that goes back to looking at the systemic biomarkers um through any intervention even the gut microbiome um as a potential output you know whether it's the neutrophils and inflammation or circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase um and then do you see changes in that as a result of optimizing or attempting to optimize your gut microbiome um a little bit of a backtrack but like what do you think about glutamine for the gut barrier so like that's a common kind of this intestinal permeability supplement what do you think about that there is some evidence that it can improve the type barrier you know the gut barrier function but uh the only way yeah i mean that's just a gross generalization right i think i think the best way is going to be through you know the lifestyle whether it's through the high cyber fiber diet whether it's through exercise training um i think that's going to be the best way now we're taking glutamine on its own outside of those things kind of band-aid the approach um would it be better or equivalent that's i don't know you p and there's probably some individuality where maybe some people could supplement with it and and then look at some systemic biomarkers and if they see improvement then it's working for them but i'd say testing is is the essential part there um you know there are things like for example just on a side note uh you know i've been taking niacin and tryptophan trying to target nad related pathways because my nad levels are low so if i didn't test and i didn't measure if i only measured nad and i doubled my nad i would think oh i'm good now i'm you know i'm out of the old range and i'm good but my dunedin pace and the only thing that was different you know how how carefully i tracked my diet my dunedin pace is my worst ever with niacin and tryptophan together and i took the niacin out but i doubled the tryptophan not knowing that epigenetic data for that july test for my august test and i'm imagining my donated paste may be even worse with doubling the tryptophan so it just goes back to this idea of glutamine may work in other studies it may work theoretically on you know gut barrier function uh but you've actually got to look at some measure of systemic biomarkers whether it's do you see lower inflammation do you see lower immune cells these could kind of signal that you've actually improved up area function if people are just taking it based on hope it may be worse physiologically that than than they expect so anyway the danina pace is probably good news for you i'm not going to catch you yet i'm going to have to play some more ketchup uh and like another thing i wanted to ask was the apple cider vinegar so that's acidic and uh can help with like digestion in some ways so like how does that what do you think about that yeah so you know what the major that the almost exclusive fatty acid that's found in apple cider vinegar vinegar acetic acid yeah which is c2 two carbons it's a short chain fatty acid produced by the gut microbiome produced by exercise training so um now then that gets to a a dose response and there are a couple factors there too um when you're drinking it it should be absorbed through the small intestine very little of it should make it to the colon right if if the amount that you're drinking gets to the colon then you've got some absorption issues through the small intestine because it's a food right so um now then considering that the gut microbiome makes acetate and make you know which is acetic acid um does having the gut microbiome making acetate in the colon downstream of the small intestine do you need those effects there in terms of gut barrier function to optimize systemic immunity and systemic health and you know lowering glycemia all the things that soluble high-soluble fiber diets have been shown to do in part through the short chain fatty acids or can you get some of that benefit without the colon and you just now have a transient increase in circulating circulating levels of acetate because of apple cider vinegar there's probably a little bit truth to both i'd imagine you do get some positive health benefit with the apple cider vinegar through the small intestine and eating it but probably maximum effects are going to be having it also in the colon um okay but then it then it becomes a dose response too because how much you know can you go too high there is some published evidence that um people who are obese have very high levels of short chain fatty acids uh both in stool and circulating so again that u-shaped curve you know if you're just having too much apple cider vinegar have you have you bypassed right the the lowest part of the u so whereas on a high fiber on a high soluble fiber diet i imagine it's hard to overshoot yeah yeah and if you like drink it directly it might be too harmful for the teeth as well so you know yep that's beautiful true speaking of that like coffee and tea so like you know coffee more like about how does it affect the oral microbiome if it's too acidic or yeah i i haven't seen any data on that um on the flip side though green tea there are a good amount of studies that have used green tea as a mouthwash for uh you know optimizing oral microbiome uh but there too you can get you get staining right so you you lose the cause the cosmetic effect is a negative but maybe it optimizes and reduce and i actually used it for a while and stopped when i saw my dentist they were like you've got some extra yellowing you know as as and i was like yeah but using green tea as a mouthwash because i stopped that too um i don't know that i would use coffee as a mouthwash i haven't seen any of those published studies but um but then too there is published evidence on coffee epidemiologically you know where uh it's associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk so you'd imagine if it did have a negative impact on the oral microbiome it isn't reflected in all cause mortality and rather than focusing on the isolated part systemically the net effect would be positive right so um yeah i guess the yeah you know the with the microbiome and oral micro balance things that you know the final outcome is still the mortality that most people want or what most people want to focus on and yeah you can start to like micromanage it a bit uh too much eventually definitely yeah definitely yeah but is there anything else you want to color that we didn't talk about something important yeah i think we got it all gut skin mouth um probiotics fiber exercise um yeah so i think that's that's the interesting story is for the people who don't need any fiber that can have good good gut barrier function or whether it's they've got the genetics to better maintain gut better function without any fiber anecdotally i know that there are stories where that exists so i think that's hugely interesting you know um what are these alternative pathways is it you know an increased in ketosis and then you've got hydroxybutyrate that acts as you know part of the improving up area function do you get enough you know beta hydroxybutyrate or or keto butyrate to optimize cup area function to me that's a huge that's a huge thing an interesting story you know because i i don't want people to think i'm a dietary absolutist and i'm definitely not a vegan right so you know um it's for the for for the people that that aren't on those high fiber diets that it doesn't work for them for whatever reason bloating and you know just don't like the foods and are on other diets you know um what is their what are their systemic biomarkers look like of gut translocation you know do they have low white blood cells and low inflammation so that that to me is the the cutting edge part of the cutting edge too is is sorting out those details um yeah i guess you have to just keep track of her symptoms and the biomarkers to see which one is you know working for you and which which diet is the best definitely yeah definitely all right uh where can people get the book ah so it's on amazon uh kindle relatively cheap um and then yeah people can find me all over the internet just type in my name all over the interwebs sounds good we'll put the link in the description and uh yeah it was great talking with you again cool thanks team same all right i'll see you around
