## Transcript

Resveratrol extends lifespan but only under two experimental conditions so let's take a look at that data first resveratrol extends lifespan in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got proportions surviving plotted against time on the x and that time is after starting resveratrol treatment at one year of age and these data were in male mice unfortunately female mice weren't used and these mice were then fed one of three diets the first diet was the standard diet which was seven percent fat but also note that there was no real food on the on that diet it included cornstarch which is simple sugar casein as a protein source maltodextrin simple sugar sucrose simple sugar soybean oil cellulose which is a non-fermentable fiber so there was no real food on this diet but that was the standard diet the second diet was the high calorie diet and this was an obesogenic diet as it was 60 fat and it induced an increase in body weight which is what we can see here so body weight plotted on the y-axis against time uh starting at 50 weeks from the beginning of the study and for the standard diet fed mice we can see the body weight was approximately constant at about 35 grams per mouse however for both high calorie fed groups including the high calorie plus resveratrol group which was 0.04 percent resveratrol or 400 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram of food we can see that both high calorie fed mice had a significant increase for in body weight about by about 40 percent which was sustained for the duration of the study so we can see why it's both a high calorie and an obesogenic diet all right so what was the impact for resveratrol on lifespan so for that we go to 0.5 survival which is median survival that's the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive and we can see that the shortest median survival was for the high calorie fed mice which had a median survival of about 108 weeks in contrast we can see that the standard diet lived significantly longer at uh or more mice on the standard diet were significantly still alive when compared with the high calorie group about 30 percent more mice fed the standard diet we're still alive at 108 weeks when compared with the 50 that was still alive on the high calorie diet but here we can see that resveratrol feeding on a high calorie obesogenic diet had more of those mice were significantly alive 20 more were still alive at 108 weeks when compared with the high calorie-fed mice so there we can see that resveratrol extended lifespan in a mouse model of diet induced obesity now these data were published in 2006 and in full lifespan data that was published in 2008 which also included data for maximum lifespan and that's what we're going to see here so again on the y-axis we've got proportions surviving or survival plotted against age and weeks after starting resveratrol treatment and this was again in one year olds and these were male mice unfortunately no female mice were used and now there are these mice were fed one of four diets the standard diet which was the same as i showed before the high calorie control that 60 fat diet and then we've got two different resveratrol groups hclr which is high calorie low resveratrol which was 100 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram of food and then hcr which was high calorie plus 400 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram food so although we can see that dashed line which is indicative of median survival they reported average lifespan which should be in the same ballpark as the median survival data for the standard standard diet mice fed the standard diet they had an average lifespan as indicated by the black arrow of about 118 weeks and we can also see that the high calorie-fed mice the obesogenic diet had a significantly shorter lifespan as indicated by the red arrow of 102 weeks and that leftward shift when compared with the standard diet when compared with the high calorie diet for mice that were fed low resveratrol we can see a significant increase for median lifespan 115 weeks versus 102 weeks but uh and then similarly uh i was going to say but because some of these studies the low risk viral increased lifespan but the high resveratrol didn't but in this situation high resveratrol or 400 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram food also extended median license or average lifespan when compared with the high calorie diet as you can see by the right word shift for the dark red line when compared with the light blue line so from this study we can see that there was increased median lifespan for both the low and relatively higher dose resveratrol fed groups from mice on the high calorie diet so what about maximal lifespan so in this study they evaluated by looking at 0.2 survival at this point eighty percent of the colony has died and only 20 is still alive and we can see it illustrated here too with this image with maximum lifespan plotted on the y-axis so first we can see that when compared with the standard diet the high calorie obesogenic diet the black versus the light blue lines the high calorie diet had significantly reduced maximum lifespan and then high calorie diet fed mice plus low resveratrol 100 milligrams per kilogram food had a significant increase in maximal lifespan from mice fed the high calorie diet and lowers veritrol when compared with high calorie diet no resveratrol but in this situation and although the curve is shifted to the right which is going in the right right uh right direction sorry the 400 milligram resveratrol group per kilogram food high calorie resveratrol didn't have a significant increase for maximal lifespan we're compared with the high calorie group that was not supplemented with lifespan nonetheless from this study we can see that resveratrol increases lifespan on this high calorie obesogenic diet but but note as indicated now by the blue arrows at most to the level found in advice on the standard diet that were not supplemented with resveratrol which then raises the question does resveratrol extend lifespan on a non-obesogenic diet that's what we're going to see here so same setup survival on the wax is plotted against time after starting resveratrol treatment which was initiated at one year of age and again this is data for male mice who were fed 100 or 400 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram of food which in this study in this survival curve was the standard diet sd as shown with the black line and then we can see the two lower resveratrol groups lr in red and the 400 milligram resveratrol group in light green so when looking at median survival with that dash red line and then average survival which was reported in the study again we know that the standard diet fed mice had an average lifespan of about 118 weeks and then when compared with the low resveratrol group we can see that the median or average survival was essentially overlapping when compared with the standard diet so low resveratrol on a standard diet did not extend median lifespan now for the higher resveratrol group although that survival curve is shifted to the right that 2.3 week increase for average lifespan was not significantly different for the standard diet fed mice that were not supplemented with resveratrol from so from these data we can see that median survival was not increased in mice fed low or relatively higher resveratrol on a standard diet so what about maximal survival so for that in the study they looked at point two survival again 80 of the colony has died 20 is still alive and here we can see virtually overlapping curves when compared with the standard diet both the low and higher dose resveratrol groups uh have a similar average sorry maximum lifespan when compared with the standard diet so here too there was no effect but maybe the resveratrol dose 100 and 400 milligrams per kilogram food maybe that dose wasn't high enough to affect lifespan on a standard diet so that was evaluate evaluated then in this study where again starting in one year olds male mice were fed now a much higher dose of resveratrol 2400 milligrams per kilogram of food of the standard diets so sd standard diet hr high resveratrol and we can see that with the green line when compared with the black line which was the standard diet fed mice so when compared with the standard diet fed mice the black lime we can see that the very high dose of resveratrol has a survival a median survival that virtually overlaps so no significant difference there for median survival for the highest dose of resveratrol on a standard diet but what about maximal survival so again point to survival 80 of the colony has died 20 still alive and there too we can see virtually overlapping curves for high-dose resveratrol on a standard diet when compared with standard diet fed mice that were not fed resveratrol so from this plot we can see that from mice on the standard diet but with high resveratrol 2400 milligrams per kilogram food there was no effect on median or maximal survival so just to re reiterate three different doses of resveratrol 100 424 milligrams per kilogram food did not extend lifespan and mice fed a standard non-obesogenic diet now these data were verified by a different research group in a separate study which is what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got survival and then on the left we've got data for males and then finally we've got data for female mice that were also supplemented with resveratrol now this is data from the interventions testing program which is the gold standard for longevity studies as the studies are performed and the survival studies are performed at three different universities university of texas ut university of michigan um and at the jackson lab and then those data from those three studies are pulled into one study which is what you can see here with the data for again male mice on the left and females on the right just like the earlier studies resveratrol treatment was started at one year of age and then we have three different dietary groups the controls in blue and note that in this case the control diet was different from the standard diet that was shown earlier as this was whole food based as opposed to the standard diet earlier which was a purified diet with no real food and then we've got two different resveratrol groups 300 parts per million which is 300 milligrams per kilogram and then similarly 1200 milligrams of resveratrol per kilogram on this whole food-based diet so what was the impact over its veritrol and lifespan in these studies so for that we go to median survival 0.5 survival and you can see that first that the curves for the blue and the red line control versus low dose resveratrol essentially overlapping so no significant difference there but we can see that the highest resveratrol group 1200 milligrams per kilogram food has a small rightward shift which is going in the right direction but that data was not significantly different when compared with standard diode-fed mice that were not supplemented with high doses resveratrol similar data was in females too you can see that the survival curves for low and high resveratrol are essentially completely overlapped with the standard diet which statistically was not they were these groups were not significantly different in terms of median lifespan so resveratrol treatment for mice on a standard diet for female and male mice so far no significant difference for maximum lifespan in this study they use 10 survival so 90 of the colony had died 10 was still alive and we see a similar similar effect or lack of an effect well compared with the standard diet you can see that the red survival curve is essentially completely overlapped with the blue line so low dose resveratrol didn't impact maximal survival in the male mice and then again although the highest resveratrol dose is shifted a little bit in the right direction going in the right direction in terms of longevity that too was not significantly different when compared with the lifespan maximum lifespan from mice fed the standard diet without resveratrol with similar data in the female mice too no effect for maximum lifespan for either of the two resveratrol fed groups on the standard diet so from these two studies we can see that five different doses of resveratrol 100 300 400 1200 and 2400 milligrams per kilogram on a non-obesogenic diet on a standard diet whether it's purified or whole food based did not extend lifespan in both male and female mice now on the opening slide i mentioned that there was another condition where resveratrol extended lifespan so what was that situation and that was for mice that were fed every other day eod and the diet in this case was the standard diet that seven percent fat diet that was purified that didn't contain any real food so on day one mice were allowed free access to eat as much as they wanted and on day two the food was removed and uh resveratrol was supplemented to the every other day fed mice so there were two resveratrol groups for the every other day feeding 100 milligrams per kilogram and 400 milligrams per kilogram for resveratrol per kilogram food all right so survival that's we can see here same setup as the earlier data survival in the y-axis plotted against age and weeks on the x with the resveratrol treatment starting at one year olds and again this is only male mice but this was they were fed every other day with those two different resveratrol doses so what was the effect on lifespan so for that we take a look at the average lifespan data we know our standard diet controls lived about 118 weeks every other day feeding had a small shift to the right which was not significantly different from the standard diaphed mice although it is going in the right direction and then in terms of resveratrol treatment there was a significant increase in lifespan for mice that were fed every other day plus 100 milligrams per kilogram resveratrol were compared with every other day feeding without resveratrol but that was true only for the low resveratrol treatment group as we can see that the pink and the orange lines the survival curves for average survival are completely overlapped so only low resveratrol for mice fat in every mice fed every other day had a significant increase in median or average survival so what about maximal survival and there we see a similar story when compared with the standard diet every other day feeding didn't impact maximum maximum survival but we can see that the blue line which is the low dose resveratrol group had a significantly increased maximum survival when compared with every other defeating without resveratrol and then once again the high dose resveratrol group or higher dose didn't increase lifespan for every other day feeding that were not supplemented with resveratrol so from these data we can see that resveratrol again increases lifespan in mice that were fed every other day but only at the lowest resveratrol dose 100 milligrams per kilogram food so if you remember the opening slide i said that resveratrol extends lifespan but only under two experiments in two experimental conditions and just to summarize those conditions were on a high fat obesogenic diet but note that the lifespan increases there were not longer than mice that were fed the standard diet so no mice on the resveratrol treatment groups live longer than the standard diet mice in terms of average and maximum lifespan under the the other condition it was when mice were fed every other day plus resveratrol but only at the lowest resveratrol dose 100 milligrams per kilogram of food and then resveratrol did not extend lifespan with five different doses of resveratrol for mice that or fed a standard both purified and whole food based non-obesogenic diet all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount
