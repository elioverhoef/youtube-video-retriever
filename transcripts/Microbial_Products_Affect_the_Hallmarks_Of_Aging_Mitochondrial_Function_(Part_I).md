# Microbial Products Affect the Hallmarks Of Aging: Mitochondrial Function (Part I)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

There are nine well-established hallmarks of aging but what's less established is the impact of microbes so why would i expect that microbes can affect the hallmarks of aging so in terms of the total number of cells in the human body human cells are outnumbered by the amount of bacterial cells so we can see that uh data here so when looking at the total number of human cells for the reference man and reference woman uh that are young 20 to 30 years old we can see that the total number of bacterial cells in the human body outnumbers human cells by 1.3 fold in the reference man and 2.2 fold in the reference woman so there's more bacterial cells than human cells in young men and women now this is also true whether it's a young infant that's four weeks old or one year old and in older adults that are 66 years old which in this case would have uh 1.8 fold more bacterial cells than human cells and it's also true in obese subjects who have 1.4 fold more bacterial cells than human cells in the human body so when considering that we're more bacterial than human in terms of cells and that the total number of bacterial genes in the human body outnumbers human genes by more than a hundred to one based on that data i would expect that microbes can affect the hallmarks of aging so that's what i'm going to talk about today microbial products affect the hallmarks of aging in particular i'm going to focus on mitochondrial dysfunction so in order to talk about mitochondrial dysfunction it's important to talk about mitochondrial function what is mitochondrial function so just as a brief overview of that mitochondria uh their main function is to produce energy in the form of atp but also as a byproduct of that process they produce superoxide so what we're looking at is a cartoon of the mitochondrial inner membrane where the electron transport complexes are which is uh where atp synthesis occurs as as a result of their actions so just briefly oxidation of nadh and fadh2 starts the biochemical and electrical process that culminates uh in the production of atp by the atp synthase with atp production in the mitochondrial matrix now as a by product of this process as i mentioned electrons can leak uh and be picked up by oxygen thereby forming the uh toxic reactive oxygen species uh superoxide now as i'm going to show in a few slides uh fortunately for us um we're able to detoxify the relatively toxic superoxide uh into the less toxic but still toxic h2o2 hydrogen peroxide by manganese superoxide dismutase mnsod and then that h2o2 is further degraded by an enzyme called catalase into water and oxygen and again i'm going to talk more about the catalase story in a few slides so what happens to mitochondrial energy and superoxide production during aging uh thereby identifying mitochondrial dysfunction as a hallmark of aging so mitochondrial function uh declines during aging so in this cartoon we're looking at uh young versus old and more more specifically we're going to zoom in on the muscle in both young and old people so if we further zoom in and go to down to the level of the mitochondria in muscle cells and even more specifically to the mitochondrial matrix we can see that the young mitochondria characterized by relatively high levels of energy production in the form of atp and relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species production superoxide in contrast the old mitochondria produce less atp less energy and produce more superoxide so uh that mitochondria again that mitochondrial function declines during aging this is well established that's why it's a hallmark of aging but again what's less discussed is that the microbial product lipopolysaccharide increases during aging and that it negatively impacts mitochondrial function so uh let's jump into that data so what's lps and i uh i've introduced this briefly in another video so if you missed that uh you can check it out there or stay here so that we can go through it just a little bit so uh lipopolysaccharide lps is found in gram-negative bacteria uh so not all bacteria that are the same some are identified through a gram-negative stain and others are identified through a gram-positive stain so lps are found in gram-negative bacteria so if we zoom in on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria we can see lps which is a metabolite that's found in the outer wall or the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria so uh blood levels of lipopolysaccharide increase during aging so first this is data in mice and we've got plasma levels of endotoxin which is just another word for like polysaccharide or lps so plasma lps on the y axis uh it plotted against young mice ym and adult mice am and what we can see is that there's a an age-related increase in lps in the blood in mice uh and just just uh you know for a brief uh you know these are these were four-month-old mice which is equivalent to teenagers in people and 18 month old mice uh which is equivalent to about being middle-aged so they compared circulating lps values basically in teenagers versus middle age significant increase in the blood all right this this effect has also been found in rats uh and this is in data that's in a pre-print from earlier this year uh young versus aged rats we can again see uh significantly increased levels of lps in the blood during aging so where's the the obvious answers or question is where's lps cut even coming from how's it even getting into the blood so let's go through that real quick so first lps can translocate from the gut into the blood so 99 of the human microbiome is found in the gut and um much of that is contained with within gram negative bacteria so much of the lps that's found in the human body is found in the gut so in the in the situation where there's good intestinal barrier function the tight junctions that connect intestinal epithelial cells are intact which then limits the ability of stuff to go from the intestinal lumen into the blood however in the situation where there is intestinal barrier dysfunction or poor gut barrier function the tight junctions that connect the intestinal epithelial cells are weakened or degraded um and more leaky and accordingly stuff that's in the lumen whether it's whole bacteria or bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide or bacterial or other metabolites or bacterial vesicles can translocate from the gut lumen into the bloodstream hence that's one way how lps can get from the gut into the blood alternatively there is indeed a gut a blood microbiome and that's what's shown here this is data in young subjects that were 21 years old so um we can see that most of the blood microbiome composition in the circle is red so the red is uh proteobacteria now proteobacteria is a gram-negative bacteria so in other words uh 83 of the blood microbiome is lps containing now there aren't any large very large studies in older adults that have compared the blood microbiome versus the in old versus young but it's possible that the uh levels of proteobacteria that are found in young at an already relatively high level 83 of all bacteria being proteobacteria it's possible that they further increase in abundance as a potential explanation for having more lps in the blood during aging so that's those are two ways how we can get more lps in the blood during aging so i showed you the data in in rodents for age-related increases in lps what about in humans uh so first looking at again plasma levels of endotoxin which is another name for lps in young versus older adult uh people in this case this was 26 years old uh 26 year olds versus 74 year olds we can again see a significant increase in lps in the blood of the older adults now this is a small study you know 13 young and 12 older so total sample size 25 it's relatively small uh data from larger studies uh it can can add more strength if it's a real effect or not so again in a pre-print so the this study has not undergone peer review but it's been published online this is data for uh 1100 more than 1100 people and how uh plasma levels of lps change during aging and what we can see is that when compared to around 20 year olds lps significantly increased uh for 60 or 60 year olds so being older than 60 there were significantly higher levels of lps when compared to the younger adults the 20 or 20 year olds now uh what about older than you know about 75 or 80 which is the upper limit of this graph so what about in centenarians so one would expect that centenarians just by virtue of being alive for a hundred years they'd have the even higher levels of lps but in fact there's one study that has looked at this and they found the opposite so centenarians actually have lower levels of blood uh lps versus healthy young controls and that's what's shown here so you know just quickly two two reasons why that could be is you know survivor bias so that they get to 100 years old they're healthier uh you know than the those that died before them who may have had poor gut barrier function or alterations in their blood microbiome nonetheless it suggests uh potentially good gut barrier function and no age related alterations in their blood microbiome as at least two potential explanations for why centenarians would have lower levels of lps in the blood so the the purpose of this video is how do microbial products affect one of the hallmarks of aging mitochondrial function so let's have a look at that data so first there's decreased mitochondrial atp production in the presence of lps so we're looking at the atp to adp ratio which is a measure of uh atp production so energy production so this is energy production by macrophages so first what we can see is when compared to uh the control macrophages that were not treated with lps versus the lps treated macrophages there's a decrease in atp production uh in the presence of lps now these are in whole macrophages so that doesn't indicate whether it's coming from mitochondrial atp production or other sources in the cell that can produce atp so to address that the authors of this study added oligomycin so what does that do so in looking at our scheme of the mitochondrial electron electron transport chain again oligomycin inhibits the atp synthase complex 5 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which produces atp so by adding oligomycin you're inhibiting mitochondrial atp production so any atp production that remained after adding oligomycin is the amount of cellular atp that was produced but was not produced by the mitochondria so when you look at those amounts we can see that the remaining amount is similar after uh lps which suggests that the amount that atp production decreased in the presence of lps was almost completely mitochondrial a defect in mitochondria so lps negatively affected the mitochondrial atp production that's what the oligomycin data helps clarify so what about ross production reactive oxygen species production so first we're looking at mitochondrial superoxide production so in this study they added a specific uh dye that gets into the mitochondria and that binds to superoxide and what they saw was in the presence of lps there were higher levels of superoxide as a result so superoxide is one measure of reactive oxygen species another is hydrogen peroxide as in a less direct measure of superoxide production as superoxide is converted into h2o2 hydrogen peroxide so in this case again we're looking at macrophages and uh hours after exposure to lps so two six and 24 hours after uh macrophages were exposed to lps what were the cellular hydrogen peroxide levels h2o2 and what we can see is that there is a dramatic increase in cellular h2o2 production in the presence of lps in in macrophages that were exposed to lps now again this is cellular and it doesn't tell you about how much of the contribution uh to the total hydrogen peroxide pool was coming from the mitochondria so to address that the authors of this study uh over expressed catalase in the mitochondria even though it's found on the mitochondria they increased the levels of catalase in the mitochondria and if you remember from an earlier slide catalase degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen as shown with the reaction map under the under the graph so any h202 that remained in the mcat macrophages so overexpressing catalase in the mitochondria containing macrophages that would be the h202 that was coming from non-mitochondrial sources so what we can see is that in at every time point two six and 24 hours the vast majority of the h2o2 production was coming from mitochondria there is some small amount that was non-mitochondria at the 24-hour point but we can see that there was a massive decrease in the amount in response to the catalase so again this this demonstrates that most of the h202 that was produced by macrophages was in mitochondrial in response to being exposed to lps so increased mitochondria rise production in the presence of lps so as a quick summary uh so mitochondria the fun uh function declines during aging which is that why it's a hallmark of aging uh lps increases during aging and high amounts negatively affect mitochondrial function so uh what i did mention is that in these studies that have looked at uh lps on mitochondria atp production and on uh reactive oxygen species production they use levels of lps that are 500 to a thousand fold times greater than what's been shown in people especially during aging so the big question is would physio more physiologically relevant levels of lps impair mitochondrial function especially in the age and there's no data to support that yet but i'd argue that based on the data that i presented it's possible that lps and maybe even other microbial products can negatively affect mitochondrial function uh and yeah again no studies have explored this yet so stay tuned all right that's uh all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
