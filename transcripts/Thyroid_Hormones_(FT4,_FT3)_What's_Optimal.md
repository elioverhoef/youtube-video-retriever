# Thyroid Hormones (FT4, FT3): What's Optimal?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Thyroid aging is impacted by and impacts many hallmarks of aging including cell inessence and tiir shortening inflammation epigenetics metabolism loss of proteostasis and stem cell renewal more specifically tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone induces the thyroid gland to produce inactive thyroid hormone or t4 and it's named t4 because it carries or it has four attached iodine atoms one of those iodine atoms is removed to produce the active form of thyroid hormone or otherwise known as t3 now t4 can be also converted into reverse t3 which diverts away from the production of active thyroid hormone or t3 and t3 can also be degraded into t2 further reducing the active thyroid hormone concentration now collectively thyroid hormone metabolism can impact longevity but also aging and age related disease so with that in mind in today's video for the thyroid hormones 3 t4 and 3 t3 what's optimal and to address that we'll take a look at how these thyroid hormones change during aging and what's their association with all cause mortality risk so first starting with the data 4 fre t4 as we'll see in this plot it it decreases then it increases during aging on the y- axis we've got free thyroxin otherwise known as t4 and this is in picomolar and that'll become a we'll see why that's important in a minute on the x-axis we've got age and note that the age range is from 20 to 90 years and later in the video we'll go deeper into age related changes in centenarians and this study includes 83,000 plus people if anyone's come across larger studies for how these thyroid hormones change during aging please post it in the comments and i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video also note that all of the papers in the video will be in the video's description with links in the videoos description all right so free t uh four in youth average levels for women in red and men in blue are around 13.25 and 13.5 pamar which then declined during aging until around the 50 to 60e range with values around 12.5 pamar afterwards we then see an age related increase up until 90 years for both women again in red and men in blue now note that the reference range for free t4 is and this is quest diagnosis diagnostics reference range is8 to 1.8 nanog per deciliter so i'm going to compare the reference range with the data that we see in the plot now first note that the units are different nanograms per deciliter is not the same as pomar so we'll have to do a conversion so when taking the lowest value 12.5 pomar which is found in around 50 to 60 years and then the values that are expected to be average values that are be expected to be found in youth 13.25 and 13.5 pamar for women and men respectively converting that into nanog per deciliter we get a range of .97 to 1.05 nogs per deciliter now when comparing that with the reference range we would miss the age related increase after 50 to 60 years and we would also miss the age related decrease prior to uh you know going from 20 years to about 50 years so this once again highlights that the reference range is not necessarily optimal we may never see changes that are outside of the range both on the too high or too low and by focusing on year-to-year changes that can better capture how we can slow potentially slow aging at least that's my hypothesis all right what about free t3 as we'll see here it decreases during aging with data that's more continuous relative to the data for freet t4 freet t4 on the waxes we've got free triiodothyronine or freet t3 again in pamer plotted against age in youth average values for women in red are about 4.6 peer and for men about 4.9 and then we can see that for both women and men values in 90-year-olds are close to about 4.1 pamer so the data is pretty continuous in terms of a decline for men whereas for women it's biphasic in other words it goes down then it goes up then it goes down again all right so here for free t3 the reference range is 2.3 to 4.2 ps per milliliter and we'll have to do some converting based on the data on this graph and when we do that we get a range of 2.67 to 3.19 p per milliliter so once again all of these values are within the reference range and if we only focused on the reference range we would miss the age related free t freet t3 decline now that free t33 is lower and that free t4 is higher at older ages after around 50 to 60 that suggests a decreased conversion of free t4 into the active thyroid hormone fre t3 during age so looking at the free t3 to free t4 ratio may be more informative and that's what we can see here which is on the y axis once again plotted against age and this is also again in the 20 to 90 year age range so in youth or relative youth younger than around 50 years old or 50 50 to 55 years old we can see that the free t3 to free t4 ratio is about average values are about. 35 to. 38 uh and that's for both women and men after which there's a significantly significant decline for the for this ratio during aging as shown by the red arrows such that at older ages we can expect to see lower values for the free t3 to free t4 ratio of around. 31 to. 32 all right but what about older than 90 years and as we'll see here there is a further reduced freet t3 to free t4 ratio in centenarians going from 3 to. 2 so on the y- axis we've got the free t3 to free t4 ratio plotted against age but in this case the age range goes from 50 years to about 113 years old and then we can see that there is a significant inverse correlation in other words a relatively lower free t3 to fre t4 ratio at the oldest ages in the oldest old relative to younger ages but maybe a lower freet t3 to fre4 ratio is a marker of longevity in other words a good thing so if centenarians have a relatively low ratio maybe that's something we should strive for but i'd argue maybe not and that's based on this data so fre t3 to 3 t4 ratio on the y- axis plotted against fi and the fi is a frailty index this study included 180 centenarians that had an average age of 102 years and to the right more frail and to the left of the plot would be on the x-axis less frail and then we can see that there's a significant inverse correlation in other words a lower free t3 to free t 4 ratio is associated with being more frail and conversely a higher ratio is associated with being less frail so that argues that having a lower ratio may may not be good for frailty and i'd argue probably not good for uh health and longevity even though you can get to advanced ages with a low ratio based on the frailty index data that would it would suggest that having higher levels may be even better for being healthier and more fit at advanced age but that's only part of the story what what's the association for this ratio with all cause mortality risk and we'll see that a relatively higher ratio is associated with reduced all cause mortality risk and conversely a ratio less than 045 is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk as we'll see here so on the y- ais we've got the hazard ratio of mortality or risk of death for all causes plotted against the fre t3 to freet t4 ratio in terms of uh how big this sample study sample size was it was about 6200 people average age of of about 46 years and with a median followup so in other words starting at the initial assessment of thyroid hormone levels who was alive and who was dead a median of about 12 years later in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and then remember where the shaded gray region is completely above it or completely below it we have a significant association so when compared with the reference which was defined as 0.5 we can see that values that were higher than that were not associated with a significantly increased all cause mortality risk as that shaded gray region completely overlaps with one in contrast when this ratio the fre t3 to 3 t4 ratio was less than about 0.45 we can see that the shaded gray region is completely above that hazard ratio of one in other words significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk all right so one study is nice these data were also shown in another study as we'll see here once again hazard ratio and the 95% confidence interval that's the shaded red region in this plot for all cause mortality or risk of death for all causes on the y- axis plotted against levels of 3 t3 ided 3 t4 and this study had a larger sample size and i usually start with the larger studies first but the x-axis is a bit screwy they didn't convert uh their thyroid hormone levels into the proper units so you can see that we've got 2 4 and six where the free t3 to free t4 ratio should be less and one so they didn't properly convert their units nonetheless we can see in both plots that the data is similar so in terms of significance we put up that red line at a hazard ratio of one and we can see that relatively higher levels for this ratio are associated with lowest all cause mortality risk whereas relatively lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so two different studies two different cohorts similar data but note that the average age in both of these studies was pretty similar and the median followup was also in the same ballpark in other words uh the average age of death was or median age of death was somewhere around 60 years so what about at older ages what's the association for this ratio with all cause mortality risk at older ages and let's go to as old as we can get centenarians an average age of 103 years as shown here survival on the y- axis who was alive and who had died plotted against time now in days and in terms of what's significant we put up that uh line at5 survival this is the time when half of the population has died and half is still alive in terms of the shortest lifespan that was cluster 3 in red and they had an average free t3 to free t4 ratio of18 and they lived an average of 500 days after the initial assessment of thyroid hormone levels in contrast cluster one as shown in blue had a higher ratio of 0.24 and they had a significant increase for median lifespan living about 400 days or 15 months longer than cluster 3 which had a lower free t3 to freet t4 ratio so from these three studies we can see that having a relatively lower ratio is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk at both young younger ages relatively younger ages and advanced age in the oldest old all right so that brings us to what's my data as one of the major goals of this channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and thyroid hormone fun function is obviously one of the organ systems now i've been taking leo thyroxin if you're familiar with the channel you then you know i've been taking leo thyoxin prescribed for almost half of my life and with that in mind i've basically forgotten about tracking thyroid hormones with the assumption that i should be fine i'm taking 137.5 micrograms per day of leo thyroxin well that may not be true so i only have two tests and i'm going to change that uh you know as i'm going to include thyroid hormone testing at every test going forward so i i'll at least have seven more tests every year going forward indefinitely so i only have two data points one of them october in 2022 and based on the t4 and t3 free levels for both my 3 t3 to fre fre t4 ratio was 0.3 not too bad as we'll see in a second for my most recent test though for the april 29th of 2024 so last month's test for the same day 3 t4 and 3 t3 and calculating the ratio i get a much lower value of 0.18 now remember it declines during aging so this is going in the wrong direction and 0.18 is what you'd expect to find in uh in you know a cent a short-lived centenarian now that doesn't mean that i've got data that will get me to centenarian status my interpretation of it is it's too low and i want to avoid the age related change and knowing that in at least two data points i've had values as high as3 i at least want it to be as high as that if not as high as the data that's found in youth. 35 to 38 so that's the plan so how will i increase it though that's the big question i only have uh two data points and i can't calculate correlations yet so the initial plan is to increase selenium intake from whole food which would i which i'd expect to be lowest risk relative to taking high does supplements and the major source of my selenium intake comes from brazil nuts now my current selenium intake mostly from brazil nuts is already around 275 microgr per day but the tolerable to sorry tolerable upper limit has been defined as 400 micrograms per day so the initial plan is to increase brazil nut intake up to the tolerable upper limit of 400 micrograms per day and then i'm going to retest very soon not just for thyroid hormones but everything else hopefully i don't increase or improve uh thyroid hormones in terms of the the free t3 to free t4 ratio but then mess up other stuff and then i'll have come up with a new strategy for improving the free t3 to freet t4 ratio so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i offer blood test consults and we've got got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification oral microbiome composition at home blood
