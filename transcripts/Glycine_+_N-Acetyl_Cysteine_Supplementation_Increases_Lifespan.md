Glutathione declines during aging to illustrate that point let's take a look at data from three different studies so first when looking at glutathione gsh on the y-axis plotted against age starting from 21 year olds up to older than 61 we can see a 50 glutathione reduction during aging similarly in study number two again glutathione on the y axis plotted against age in this case starting with glutathione concentrations in blood again all these data are in blood from birth we can see a significant 15 glutathione reduction when starting from newborns up to about 70 years and then in study number three again glutathione on the y axis we can see that there's about a 33 glutathione reduction when comparing the youngest group 20 to 29 with people older than 60. So with that in mind can restoring glutathione levels in older adults improve health so to optimize glutathione first we need we'll need to know what it's made of and that's we can see here so glutathione as shown there is a tripeptide which means it's made of three amino acids cysteine glutamic acid or glutamate and glycine now although i won't go into that data here i've presented this in an earlier video glycine and cysteine levels decline during aging and if you missed that video it'll be in the right corner so when considering that glycine and cysteine levels decline during aging uh strategies aimed at replenishing glycine and cysteine or more specifically an acetylcysteine as a source of cysteine may restore glutathione and potentially improve health-related outcomes in older adults so in this study high-dose glycine plus and acetyl cysteine was supplemented to older adults 71 to 80 years old and this was a relatively small study of 16 people so actually only half that eight of the 71 to 80 year olds got the glycine plus and acetyl cysteine and the other eight were a young control group and this was a study that lasted for 24 weeks and without going through all the individual data just going through the highlights we can see that glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine supplementation in glutathione deficient older adults improved glutathione deficiency which because glutathione is an antioxidant it reduced oxidative stress with reduced oxidative stress we should expect to see reduced genomic damage or oxidative damage to dna which is what they saw but it also reduced markers of inflammation and insulin resistance improved mitochondrial function reduced markers of endothelial dysfunction improved body composition including reduced fat mass it improved muscle strength and increased exercise capacity and last but not least it improved cognition now interesting that i started making this video last sunday and on wednesday of this week similar day similar data was just published in a new study by the same research group so we can see the title there and it was published on 8 17 so wednesday of this week and if you're interested in checking out that paper it'll it'll be in the video's description so in that study they once again used high-dose glycine plus and acetylcysteine and more specifically they used 100 milligrams of each glycine and n-acetyl cysteine per kilogram of body weight so for someone that's around 154 pounds 70 kilograms which is in the ballpark of my body weight that would mean seven grams each of glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine so they expanded the age range in this video in this study in the earlier study was 71-80 in this study it was 61 to 80. They increased their sample size by just a little bit it included 23 people uh relative to the smaller sample size of the earlier study and note that of those 23 people 11 of them were the older adults that well actually both groups the older adults there were 11 and then there were 12 younger subjects everybody got uh glycine placenta acetylcysteine i'm only going to present the data in older adults though because there were no major changes for the young adults taking uh nsc uh and acetyl cysteine plus glycine so this study was also a bit shorter uh 16 weeks when compared with their earlier study which was 24 weeks and then just going through the highlights we can see that glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine impacted many of the same things that the earlier study did so i won't go through each of them individually but then they also it was also shown to improve markers that they didn't go through in the first study including markers of cellular senescence improved markers related to stem cells and mitophagy and reduced blood pressure so when considering these two randomized control trials in older adults glutathione restoration may be a promising approach for improving aging related outcomes in people that are or most specifically older adults that are deficient or that have age-related or somehow related somehow a deficit in their blood levels of glutathione whether it's age-related or some other uh condition that's leading to reduced glutathione all right so that's not the purpose of this video to rehash old data i want to know can glutathione restoration increase lifespans we haven't yet covered that on this channel and then also do centenarians have relatively higher or lower levels of glutathione so first let's take a look at the lifespan data and as you can see by the title i've given away the story glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine supplementation extends lifespan and mice so here we're looking at that data and we've got two groups of mice mice that were fed the regular diet in red and there were 16 of those mice including eight males and eight females and the genotype was c57 black 6j which if you've watched my other videos or more recent videos that animal genotype was also used in some of the calorie restriction fasting and circadian alignment studies and then in green we've got the mice that were supplemented with the regular diet plus glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine and again also 16 mice eight males and eight females and then supplementation was started at 65 weeks and they used a dose of glycine and acetylcysteine that would be similar to what was used in their human studies so 1.6 milligrams of each glycine and acetyl cysteine per gram of food all right so what was the impact on survival so for that we look at median survival which is the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive so that's eight mice for the control group as shown there and then we can see a significant increase for median lifespan in the glycine plus n-acetyl-cysteine supplemented groups 24 129 weeks versus 104 for controls now this study did have some limitations though so 16 versus 16 mice is a is a relatively small study for evaluating survival and for more information on that check out my recent calorie restriction fasting and circadian alignment videos which included more than 40 mice per group not 16 per group more than 40 per group and also they didn't report how much food was consumed or body weights of these animals at any point during their lifespan and that's important because if the animals that were supplemented with glycine placenta acetyl cysteine even were on a small but mild calorie restriction we know that that can extend lifespan so did the supplemented animals eat less as a potential explanation for these effects we don't know but this study also had strengths including glutathione restoration in multiple tissues which is what we can see here so this is heart liver and kidney levels of glutathione and we've got micro moles of glutathione per grams of heart liver or kidney going from left to right and then you can see on the x axis we've got rgsh the r stands for reduced so that's the version of glutathione that can combat or can ameliorate oxidative stress because when glutathione is reduced actually when glutathione is oxidized it's in its gssg form and it's not going to contribute to reducing or helping to reduce oxidative stress so in terms of the form that we're interested in it's rgsh all right so when comparing young versus old blue versus the red we can see that that the young animals had much higher levels of glutathione in their heart liver and kidney when compared with the old animals but then when old animals were supplemented with glycine placenta acetylcysteine we can see a rebound where glutathione levels were restored it for each of those tissues so from this we can conclude that the lifespan extending effect of glycine plus n-acetyl cysteine supplementation is associated with glutathione restoration in multiple tissues all right so what about the data in centenarians are glutathione levels relatively higher or lower in centenarians now we saw earlier that glutathione levels declined during aging so from that we'd predict that centenarians should have lower levels uh since glutathione declines during aging so is that true so here we're looking at blood levels of glutathione and we've got two groups one that's close to centenarian with an average age of 97 and this is there were 116 subjects in that category and then their offspring that had an average age of 67 years and there were 232 of those subjects and what we can see is that the centenarians had an average a higher average blood glutathione level when compared with the the group that was 30 years younger such that the fold change they had about a 50 percent relatively higher level of glutathione when compared with the younger group and this data was statistically significant as you can see the p value and the false discovery rate fdr were both less than 0.05 so from this we can conclude that being able to maintain relatively high glutathione may be important for longevity especially when considering the animal data and the rct data in those two separate studies that showed a whole bunch of health related effects for glutathione restoration on all of those different health health-related effects all right so last but not least note that for each of glutathione's component amino acids they're also relatively higher in centenarians which may be a potential explanation why glutathione levels are higher in the close to centenarian group when compared with the 67 year olds and we can see that here if you remember glutathione is comprised of three amino acids cysteine glycine and glutamate or glutamic acid and when looking at the fold change and the p and p value and fdr we can see that these are all higher and significantly higher in the centenarians when compared with the group that was 30 years younger all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack
