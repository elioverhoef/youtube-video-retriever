# LPS Increases During Aging: Besides Calorie Restriction, What Else Can Reduce It?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video i showed evidence that lps also known as lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin increases cd38 expression and i also showed data that cr calorie restriction can reduce lps which uh introduces a hypothesis that one of the reasons that cr may result in increased nad levels is because of its effect on reducing lps now that's one intervention that can reduce lps are there other interventions that can also reduce it with the goal of maximizing nad production so i'm going to talk about that in a few slides but before we get there it's important to just do a quick review because it's going to be important to the discussion in a slide or two so first levels of lps increase during aging and that's been shown in the left in mice and in people and again if you want more of a review of this topic i'll link the previous video in the right corner now the age-related increase in lps is important again as i mentioned because cd 38 gene expression and macrophages is increased up to seven-fold as shown here in the presence of lps and also when macrophages are exposed to lps they don't just increase gene expression within macrophages they release cd38 uh into the external environment so that potentially would indicate an increase in circulating cd38 to uh negatively impact nad levels uh systemically not a good thing so where is this lps coming from how did it get there and then what can we do to reduce it so i showed this data in that previous video too but i'm going to add a little bit more information uh that'll lead us into the story for this video so lipopolysaccharides found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and that's what's shown here and so there's the outer membrane and then you can see a light polysaccharide as the metabolites sticking out from the outer membrane now what i didn't show and highlight in the last video is that um in the proportion of the lps molecule i've highlighted two phosphates that are found in its lipid a portion and this is important because i'm going to introduce a protein later on that takes those phosphates off that dephosphorylates it which detoxifies lps so that data is coming in a little bit so when considering that lps increases during aging and that lps is found in the outer wall of gram negative bacteria does that mean that the lps that's in the blood is that coming from an increased amount of blood bacteria and in part there is evidence to support that hypothesis so we're looking at here is the incidence of e coli bacteremia which means the presence of e coli bacteria in the blood as a function of age so first what we can see is that the incidence of having e coli found in the blood is very high for babies zero to one years old and then it dramatically decreases uh you know up till about 15 to 24 years but then when comparing that age group with 25 to 49 year olds we can see that 25 to 49 year olds have about a double incidence of having e coli in the blood but even worse than that is that 74 year olds or older have about a 10 times higher incidence of having e coli bacteria in the blood compared to the 25 to 49 year olds so there's definitely an increase in lps containing e coli in the blood during aging so where did it come from how's it how's it getting into the blood well one possibility is that it's coming from the intestine and intestinal levels of e coli increase during aging which would make sense based on the blood e coli data so what we're looking at here is e coli abundance in the intestine as a function of age so in younger than 20 year olds e coli levels range intestinally cold levels range from about eight to ten percent that then decrease uh a little bit uh to uh until you get to about 40 to 49 years old where it's more tightly around eight percent seven ish to eight percent but then you can also see that the e coli levels then dramatically increase such that uh 80 people who are over the age of 80 have e coli levels that are 12 to 14 of the total uh bacterial amount in the intestines so a six around a six percent increase in e coli levels in the blood uh sorry in the intestine so um i didn't show some of this data in that i just wrote down here but during aging there's obviously which i showed there's an increased intestinal amount of lps containing bacteria but there's also decreased barrier function i didn't get into that but the decreased barrier function would then uh be an explanation why there would be an increase of lps containing e coli in the blood so is there a way to reduce intestinal e coli levels to improve gut barrier function and also to detoxify lps and remember the end game here is uh reducing lps so that we can reduce cd38 expression to maximize nad and in boost health health span and lifespan and all the good things that come with that so i'm going to introduce a protein here and that's intestinal alkaline phosphatase and that protein is found obviously in the intestine as its name says and it's been shown to detoxify lps now how it detoxifies lps is partly encoded in its name it's a phosphatase so if you remember a couple of slides ago i had introduced that lps has uh phosphate groups in its lipid a core that uh this protein iap dephospho dephosphorylates and removes them thereby reducing lps's activity so that's what we see here in this picture so starting from the top of it uh with the luminal microflora that's the microbiome contained in in your stool and some of the bacteria in that microflora have lps and then you can see the phosphate groups in yellow that are attached and then the iap that's in green dephosphorylates those uh phosphate groups on lps and removes them and that's what you can see with the lps with its free phosphate groups now that's important because on the left side we see lps intact that's intact and when it's intact it binds to its receptor in this case intestinal epithelial cells its receptor is called tlr toll-like receptor and when lps binds to the tlr receptor actually in any cell not just in tesol epithelial cells it it's it signals a pro-inflammatory cascade inflammation is bad it's i don't have to explain it in this is this video you know everybody knows having too much inflammation is bad it increases during aging so in contrast when iap intestinal alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylates lps that detoxifies it and lps can no longer bind to tlr its tlr receptor to stimulate that pro-inflammatory cascade so iap is good for potentially reducing inflammation based on this you know this data so while that seems like iep would be very important in this lps story however intestinal levels of ip iep decreased during aging and that's what's shown here in human data so this is actually ip in intestinal contents as a function of age that's what's plotted and we can very clearly see that someone in their 30s with values around 0.4 uh are reduced to about half 0.2 to someone that's 70. So that you know aging induces a decreased iap activity and that's got functional consequences so in this case this is data in mice and this is a frailty intake index data as a function of age so they they looked at frailty in 4 12 and 21 month old mice uh so so what did they compare so they compared frailty in wild-type animals who have iap and then they knocked it out which would basically simulate the aging condition where it's dramatically decreased so it didn't do anything in the four-month-old mice this is essentially you know a 10th uh you know maximum mouse lifespan is about 40 months that's not on cr just the normal lifespan so four divided by 40 months is one tenth of the lifespan which in human years would be about a teenager 12 year old so uh but there was no effect uh you know when comparing uh having less iap on frailty in young mice however in the 12 and 21 month old mice we can see that not having iap the mice were more frail significantly more frail when compared with the animals that had iap at both ages so not having iap obviously will induce frailty in the mice but what about having more iep if this hypothesis of iep having anything to do with health is true we'd expect to see opposite effects if you add more of it in so that's what they did and again this is the again in mice and what we can see is in animals that were treated with iep uh that were 18 months old and 21 months old we can see that the animals treated with iep and this is wild type animals not the knockout animals so give the normal mice more iap and the blue bars show that they were less frail at both 18 and 20 21 months of age so um functionally iep is important but more important or or equally to some important is lifespan what affected does iep have on lifespan so that's what we see here survival plotted against age and again this is mouse data so they compared the normal lifespan with the black line versus iep knockout mice which do not have intestinal alkaline phosphatase and they also compared supplementing the mice with iap and the mice that didn't have iap live significantly shorter you can see that with the red line and in contrast the animals that were supplement supplemented with iop had both an increased average and maximal lifespan so we could argue based on this data that iep is important for both health and longevity so with all that to consider which interventions uh increase iap so first omega-3 fatty acids uh have been shown to increase uh intestinal levels of alkaline phosphatase so what they did in this study was they used transgenic animals that would have an increased omega-3 level in tissues which then would reduce the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio but they also did experiments directly supplementing the animals with fish oil so the omega-3 in this case would refer to fish oil so what happened when they had uh higher levels of omega-3 and tissues and a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio well it induced changes in the gut microbiome and we can see that here iep iep levels increased e coli levels which again contain lps decreased correspondingly levels of intestinal lps decreased i didn't box it but gut permeability also decreased and the net effect of those changes were decreased levels of lps in the blood which would be good again with the cd8 story because less lps potentially less cd38 potentially more nad and all the good stuff that would come from that now they also did experiments uh inhibiting iep to to look at its contribution to uh its ability to affect the gut microbiome composition and its ability to affect circulating levels of lps and gut permeability and found that it was you know while omega-3 induced iep it was iep that was driving the changes in less e-coli less lps less gut gut permeability and also less circulating lps now also just to play this forward on on this picture a little bit more again so with less circulating lps that uh there's less of it that binds to tlr4 and then less of the intracellular uh signaling cascade that activates uh pro-inflammatory uh gene expression or uh you know actually protein levels of tnf alpha il-6 and il-1 beta which are pro-inflammatory molecules so omega-3 and the iap story would be good potentially not just for the for nad but also for reducing systemic levels of inflammation so what about other interventions uh well another intervention that increases iep is potentially a high soluble fiber diet so not all fiber is the same fiber is comprised of insoluble fiber which is not fermented by gut bacteria and soluble fiber which is fermented by gut bacteria into the short chain fatty acids here uh acetate c2 two carbon fatty acid propionate c3 a three carbon fatty acid and butyrate c4 a four carbon fatty acid and why those are fatty acids those short chain fatty acids are important is because when colonic epithelial cells are exposed to short chain fatty acids in this case they also besides using c2 c3 c4 they also did c5 and c6 of 5 and 6 carbon fatty acids so when adding short chain fatty acids and looking at iap gene expression compared to actin a loading control they found that uh highest levels of ip were induced by butyrate c4 so when considering that butyrate is increased by a high fiber diet one could posit that eating a high fiber diet would also increase iap levels in the intestine now those on a ketogenic diet could also make a similar argument because uh with a high fat ketogenic diet you're going to have an increase in uh fatty acid oxidation and that increase in fatty acid fatty acid oxidation should lead to an increase in acetate acetate is a c2 short chain fatty acid as i mentioned here but then acetate is also it can it can also be combined into butyrate so um but i look for more direct evidence for a ketogenic diet on increasing short chain fatty acid levels and i didn't find any rcts on that so that's purely a hypothesis whereas a high soluble fiber diet has been well published well known it's well known to increase uh you know intestinal levels of short chain fatty acids now last uh vitamin k has been shown to increase intestinal levels of uh alkaline phosphatase so uh what we're looking at here is both k1 and k2 were given to rats and then their levels of intestinal phosphatase activity iap were compared against controls or control fed animals so in the duodenum uh we can see that k1 resulted in increased iap activity relative to control but k2 did not however in the jejunum both vitamin k1 and vitamin k2 increased iep activity when when compared to animals that were not supplemented with either of the vitamin k isoforms so it's also important to note that the rats were fed in this study uh 600 milligrams of vitamin k1 or k2 per kilogram of food uh and that the animals also ate 15 to 16 grams of food per day so when you crunch the numbers there and consider that the uh the body size conversion for rats to humans is divided by six the equivalent human dose to get this boost in iap activity would be at about 1500 micrograms of vitamin k1 per day just as an example and i didn't include this in my k1 video i'll link to the k1 video for those that are interested in the right corner here but one reason why i shoot for the 1500 micrograms of k1 per day which is dramatically higher than the adequate intake of about 100 or so micrograms per day is in part because of this data so just as a quick summary if we increase iap with diet one would expect less lps and when considering the association between lps and cd38 that potentially would result in more nad now the last half of this uh uh this hypothesis has not been tested i look for evidence uh published evidence for iep and nad levels and it hasn't been tested yet but based on everything i've shown you so far it it seems like a pretty low risk approach to change with diet with the potential uh high benefit of improving nad levels and that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
