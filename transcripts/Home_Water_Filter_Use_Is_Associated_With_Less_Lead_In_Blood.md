# Home Water Filter Use Is Associated With Less Lead In Blood

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that blood levels of lead are associated with an older biological age and an increased risk of death for all causes now a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of organ and systemic function with the goal of staying as youthful as possible for as long as possible so with that in mind what's my data for lead and additionally what may help keep plasma lead levels relatively low so first what's my data to start on that journey i went to ulta laab test do where i ordered the plasma test and a bunch of other tests on that day too and if you want to do that yourself and help support the channel there's an affiliate link in the video's description so i then brought the form to quest diagnostics and for a september 6 test we can see that my plasma levels of lead were less than 1 microgram per deciliter which is their lowest limit of detection which then raises the question what's optimal so for that we'll take a look at a plot for all cause mortality risk which is shown here on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of lead in blood on the x lowest risk of death for all causes was associated with plasma lead levels that were less than 0.8 microgr per deciliter so i seem to be in good shape for plasma levels of lead at less than 1 microgram per deciliter now note that the reference range the upper limit of the reference range is less than 3.5 microgram per deciliter and just the highlight that the reference range is generally not what's optimal at least in terms of all cause mortality risk in this study we can see that people who would have 3.5 microgram per deciliter would be associated with a an 30% increased risk of death fr all causes relative to people who had plasma lead levels that were 0.8 micrograms per deciliter all right so next up is what might contribute to relatively low levels of lead in in blood or lead in plasma now one factor might be home water filter usage or home water treatment which is associated with reduced levels of lead in blood and that's what we'll see here on the y- ais and on the x we've got no uh wtd and uh wtd which stands for utilization of household water treatment devices so then the obvious question is what are these household water treatment devices so they included bre or brea or other water pitcher filters uh ceramic or charcoal filters water treatment including water softeners or airators and also reverse osmosis so people who reported using these water treatment or water filters what was what were their plasma lead levels so then we've got five groups data for all people in black men in pink or red women in green and then two age groups so older than 60 and younger than 60 in purple and for each of these groups including the whole cohort we can see that people who reported using home water filter treatment or home water filters had significantly lower levels of lead in blood now this is just an association it's not causation but it suggests that using water filters may be one way we can help keep plasma lead levels relatively low so with that in mind what water filter do i use so i've been using clearly filtered water pitchure which is shown here which on their website they claim to remove up to 99.3% of lead and i can't say if this is what is causing my relatively low levels of lead or not this is just one factor in the approach if you want to use this picture yourself there's a link in the video's description now the story for plasma lead levels are not yet complete i it it could be right i'm using the water pil uh water uh water filter and my lead levels are relatively low but i recently added cocoa beans whole cocoa beans back into the approach to test correlations with mcv and lipoprotein a and i added a relatively high amount or at least close to the high high end of my range since 2015 when i started tracking diet so around 20 gam per day now cocoa beans have lead they're a notorious source of relatively high lead levels and in one study that i found they contain about 2 micrograms of lead per gram of cocoa bean which based on my 20 g intake per day now which i'm going to continue at least through november and december too until the next test that should increase my my dietary intake of lead by about 40 micrograms per day will that have an impact on plasma levels of lead i don't don't yet know but that blood test is scheduled for the december test all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself while helping to support the channel including alab test.com where you can order almost any blood test clearly filters water pitch epigenetic testing or microbiome composition nad testing with gfinity at home metabolomics including more than 600 different metabolites at home blood testing with scifox health which includes apal b but also the epigenetic test grim age green tea diet tracking with cheter or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
