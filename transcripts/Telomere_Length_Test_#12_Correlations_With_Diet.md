# Telomere Length Test #12: Correlations With Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tiir shortening is a hallmark of aging but even worse than that it negatively impacts other hallmarks including genomic instability mitochondrial dysfunction and stem cell exhaustion more specifically tiia length declines during aging and that's what we'll see here with data from men and women on the y- axis we've got ltl or lucy tiir length so tiir length inside white blood cells plotted against age on the x from about 20 to 100 years old and for both men and women we can see that age related decline such that average t length in youth is about 7.75 kilobases whereas in 100y olds it's an average closer to about 5 kilobases now essential premise of the channel is to try to slow aging by optimizing biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible t length is on the list and with that in mind i now have data for 12 tests so what's my tiir length and then with the goal of potentially lengthening tiir getting them closer to youthful status which factors are significantly correlated so let's jump right into the data and to address that i simp blood to true diagnostic if you want to measure your own t length there's a discount link in the video's description so here's that data for all 12 tests t length on the y- axis plotted against collection date on the x for three tests in 2022 average tm length was 7.04 kilobases in 2023 over a tests it was a bit higher 7.13 kilobases what about 2024 the first test of this year was on january 15th and we can see that tary length was a bit better than 2023 at 7.16 kilobases and note that that's a nice rebound from the last test which was 7.06 kilobases which is when i supplemented with two grams of nn per day with the goal of increasing nad and doing a different experiment i'll link to that experiment in the right video if you missed it but no nmn higher tm length at least for this one test so in terms of biomarker goals they are to improve year-over-year and or to resist any age related decline so we can see that both of these are true but this is only part of the story remember youth is characterized by a tary length of an average tary length of 7.75 kilobases so i've got some work to do to try to get back to that or as close to that as i can so with that in mind can t length be further lengthened and with that in mind which factors are significant correlated with t length so let's start off by taking a look at correlations for diet with t length so note that i looked at comparisons for 97 foods macro uh foods macro and micronutrients against t l so for those who may be new to the approach or new to the channel i track diet every day weigh all my food i enter that data into chronometer and then i manually enter that data into a spreadsheet now if there's a 60-day period just for example it may be 49 and maybe 42 maybe 56 let's just say 60 days in between blood tests the average dietary intake for that period lines up with the latter blood test so every blood test every biomarker has a corresponding average dietary intake and then once i get past about five uh blood tests or five biomarker data data for about five biomarkers i start looking at correlations so i now have 12 testr length so we can look at correlations that's what we can see here these are the top hits and i mentioned that these are the top hits because there are 30 seven foods or nutrients that are significantly correlated at a p value less than 0.05 with tm length if you're interested in the full list they're in the correlations tier on patreon so check that out if you're interested in terms of what's on the table the lowercase r is the correlation coefficient and then the p value you can see that all of the foods or nutrients on this list have a p value less than or equal to 0.01 in terms of what's on the list we can see that positive correlations for vitamin b1 black pepper beets selenium brazil nuts cloves and vitamin k in other words towards the higher end of my range intake for these foods and nutrients is significantly correlated with a longer tiir length conversely total fructose has an inverse a significant inverse correlation with tiir length so in other words a relatively higher fructose intake is inversely correlated or significant correlated with a lower shorter tmal length now note that this is not from sugar sweetened beverages and junk food my diet in terms of calorie amounts is 99% clean 1% from junk at most somewhere in that ballpark and i've detailed that in my diet composition videos now note that these are the correlations after test number one in 2024 and the reason i raised that issue is let's take a look at the correlations after test number seven in 2023 so two tests later is the list the same has the list changed so we can see first that there were 43 foods or nutrients that were significantly correlated to tess ago and now it's 37 so some foods or nutrients have come off be uh significant list at a p value less than 0.05 but what's uh still on the list are four foods and nutrients or at the top of the list selenium vitamin b1 brazil nuts and black pepper are on both correlation lists but we can see that whereas parmesan cheese was the top hit top correlation hit two tests ago it's not on the top list two tests later its correlation currently is 0.62 which is still significant at a p value less than 0.05 but its correlation has weakened which suggests that other stuff may be more important for impacting tiir length cacao beans is also in that same situation it had a correlation coefficient of .88 it's now .61 so that correlation has weakened suggesting that again other stuff may be more important if correlation impacts uh causation now note that this approach is uh one of measurement and then evaluating correlations after measurement which i i term find out that's the find out phase and then after evaluating correlations following as many of them as possible or the intervention phase which i call the fround so this is the f around find out approach for trying to optimize biomarkers as an as an approach for trying to slow aging now all jokes aside these are unadjusted correlations and with that in mind are any of these foods or nutrients significant correlated with t length after adjusting for calorie intake and that's important to consider because calorie intake is significantly associated or significant correlated with tiir length which is what we can see here on the y- ais we've got t length plotted against the average daily calorie intake and remember this is the average daily dietary intake from one blood test to the next and then we can see that there is a significant inverse correlation for comparison after test number seven that correlation was nega 0.85 so the correlation for calorie intake with t length has weakened by a bit which suggests that maybe it's not just tiir length that's driving uh improvements for uh for tm length there may be other stuff in the diet that could do it too which is good news because eventually i'll reach a lower limit for calorie intake where i just can't get leaner because if i get leaner i'm also losing muscle mass and i'm not trying to do that so it's this is important data because it suggests that there may be other stuff in the diet besides calorie intake that could impact t length so what this data shows is that a relatively higher calorie intake is significant correlated with a shorter tm length and conversely a relatively lower calorie intake is significantly correlated with a longer t t t length so to address the question are any of these correlations significant after adjusting for calorie intake i then built multivariant linear aggression models and what that means it's just a fancy way of saying that now after uh what's included in the model isn't just the food or nutrient calories are now also included and after adjusting for calorie intake we can see that in this case vitamin b1 is still significantly positively correlated with t length so after adjusting for calorie intake vitamin b1 is significantly associated with tm length and using that same approach black pepper beets selenium and brazil nuts are also still significantly associated with tm length after adjusting for calorie intake but that's no long longer true for cloves and anything below cloves won't will will also not be significant as their correlations are weaker so adjusting for calorie intake will make the uh correlation probably make the correlation even weaker so the goal for the next test then is to test this hypothesis to potentially intervene if i increase these foods or nutrients for test number two in 2024 will i increase tm length and i i am doing that so for vitamin b1 i've added p's already into the diet with the goal of increasing trigonelline which may impact nad i'll put the link to that video if you missed that experiment in the right corner but then i've also increased or kept relatively high black pepper beets selenium and brazil nuts so i'm following all five of these top correlations for tiir length the question is though will it work test number two for 2024 in 2024 is scheduled for march 4th so that data should be uh around sometime at the end of march so stay tuned for an update sometime in early april all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biy high aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing including tm length ned quantification oral microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apop green tea chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the
