# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #4 in 2021

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Last week i blood tested for the fourth time in 2021 so with that in mind what's my biological age so here we're looking at data for morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric of biological age so without going through each uh variable uh individually we can see that the net effect of these nine biomarkers is that my biological age is about 13 years younger than my chronological now uh this isn't the only biological age test that we can use that's freely available and another is aging.ai so what is my biological age using aging.ai so here we're looking at the 19 biomarkers for aging.ai and based on the that data we can see that my predicted age is 31 years old which is uh about 17 and a half years younger than my chronological age so then the obvious question should be or could be what's contributing to my relatively youthful biological age so in terms of supplements and these are the supplements that correspond to the 43-day period in between blood tests and my last blood test was on july 21st uh so my latest blood test was on september 2nd so that period in between blood tests is 43 days uh and my supplements that i took during that period are the same as for my last blood test levothyroxine i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking that for about 20 years and then i'm taking methyl b12 to help limit my homocysteine levels which have a tendency to to increase which they increase during aging so i'm trying to limit that but note that for the for my next blood test i've removed the methyl b12 supplement and i'll get into that a little bit more later in this video and i'll actually have a separate video on why i'm going to do that but uh for the at least for the next blood test i'm gonna take it out and see what effect it has on my homocysteine levels all right what about fitness stats so my body weight uh for this dietary period for this 43 day period that corresponds to the blood test from last week is about the same as for my last blood test so 156.7 was the last body weight so it's about it's a 10th heavier so essentially the same uh accordingly my bmi is similar 24.6 it was 24.5 last time and then my cardiovascular health related metrics resting heart rate rhr and heart rate variability hrv so we can see that my resting heart rate went down uh 1.1 beats per minute since the last blood test again 43 days ago and my heart rate variability uh increased so it went up about five and a half milliseconds and these are favorable changes because uh we want our resting heart rates to go down but increase heart rate variability and that will be going in the right direction in terms of cardiovascular fitness related metrics now what it what impact did these improvements these relatively small improvements for resting heart rate heart rate variability have on biological age and as we can see based on my previous biological age for levine's test 35.3 and aging.ai which was 29 one could argue that the improvements these relatively small improvements for resting heart rate heart rate variability didn't impact my biological age at all so with that in mind what's my diet and i haven't done a full diet breakdown in probably about a year so it's it's about time we get into that so uh just real quick it's important to note that this is my average daily dietary intake for that 43 day period july 21st through september 1st so the day before the blood test and i weigh all my food with a food scale and that's every day without fail and then i enter those food amounts into uh online software free software chronometer and i'm not sponsored by them so you can use anything myfitnesspal has a similar approach there may be other tools online tools that one can use but that's what i use and then the output data including macro and micronutrients and individual food amounts i then enter those into a spreadsheet and then with enough data for diet fitness metrics and blood biomarkers and note that i have now 32 blood tests since 2015 i can then investigate which aspects of this approach can impact and then correspondingly can i optimize the blood biomarkers and then i expect that approach will minimize disease risk and maximize longevity so the food intake now i've got this uh in three columns so on the left is the rank in grams so i've ranked these um in numerical order from 1 to 26 and i have a second half of that from 27 to 52 but in terms of how much of each food do i eat i've got them ranked in order numerical order all right so then the individual foods in the middle column and then the amount that i ate in grams ounces or calories and to be consistent i everything is mostly in grams but there are a few on this list that are in ounces like green tea as in ounces and there's some other stuff that may be in calories i'll i'll note that in a second so what is my diet mostly comprised of and atop the list are carrots and obviously carrots as indicated by their name are carotenoid-rich now carrots aren't the only carotenoid-rich food that i eat as you can see by the red arrows of other carotenoid-rich foods including spinach red bell peppers watermelon avocado and tomato are prominent within the top 11 foods that i eat on a daily basis so why carotenoid rich foods and i presented this in another video but if you've missed it for a quick review on that relatively higher blood levels of carotenoids are associated with a younger biological age and in this case it was epigenetic age so dna grim age dna methylation by the grim age metric so this is blood levels of carotenoids which we can see there and the n is the sample size so this was in a study of about 2 300 people the bi core is the correlation for blood levels of carotenoids with epigenetic age and then the p-value is indicative of statistical significant signific sorry significance for all of these uh carotenoids so it isn't just the total sum of all the carotenoids in blood that was correlated with the younger epigenetic age which is shown there but each of the individual carotenoids like including lycopene alpha and beta-carotene lutein and zeaxanthin and beta cryptoxanthin so higher intakes or higher intakes of those would be expected to result in higher blood levels of those carotenoids and correspondingly that may impact epigenetic age or impact a more youthful epigenetic age so with that in mind i go for coverage for each of these carotenoids in my diet lycopene including watermelon and tomatoes alpha and beta-carotene spinach and carrots lutein and zeaxanthin again spinach and then beta-cryptozambin which i get from red bell peppers now other foods that are prominent on my list are strawberries uh coming in at second place and strawberries are a rich source of physetin which has been shown to extend both average and maximal lifespan in mice and that's what's shown here so we're looking at percent survival plotted against age on the x-axis and when compared to the median survival in the control diet which contain no physetin we can see that the physetin fed mice supplemented mice had both that increase in average uh or median lifespan and also in maximal lifespan as shown there by the shifting in the right curves the red curves to the right so other other foods that are prominent in my diet are blackberries and parsley and one reason for that is because they are sources of dietary cd38 inhibitors curomanin which inhibits cd38 is found in blackberries and apigenin as i'm sure we all know is found in parsley and this is fresh parsley that i eat average an average of 47 grams per day fresh parsley every day so why dietary cd38 inhibitors and i've also some videos on this on my channel so if you're interested in more info this is just a quick summary of that so please check it out if you're interested but as we can see nad levels decline during aging and one reason for that is because cd38 levels increase and cd38 is a nadas which means that it's a nad degrading protein now c38 inhibitors can correspondingly inhibit cd38 and these inhibitors include epigenin and coromanon which i mentioned are found in parsley and blackberries respectively and that would be expected to increase nad or at least slow the age-related nad decline now i haven't measured nad so until then i think it's a prudent strategy to include some of these cd38 dietary cd38 inhibitors rather than none in my diet now also last on the list that just popped up with the red arrow is cheesecake now you know obviously if you look at the 26 foods it looks relatively clean but uh notice that i do have cheesecake there and that's not eating a little bit of cheesecake every day what i usually do is after i get my blood tested on that day i have a cheat meal or a cheat day however you want to call it really not a fan of that term cheat meal and cheat day a celebratory meal i don't know just something to uh something that i feel like eating and on that day it was cheesecake so i had a big piece of cheesecake from the cheesecake factory and you know that 29 calories per day is actually over that 43 day span so it was like a 1400 calorie piece of cheesecake now it wasn't just cheesecake that i had on that day we can also see that i had m ms on that day but then you know whereas some people may uh have cheat meals uh daily or or weekly uh i try to limit this to once per dietary period at most so this was the only um you know processed junk food that i had during that 43 day period in between blood tests one slice cheesecake and a bag of m m's so that's my uh dietary intake what about my diet composition including total calorie intake you know protein fat and carb composition so starting from the top we can see that my total calorie intake for this dietary period that corresponds to the blood test that i got done last week was about 2500 calories and then in terms of the percentages of carbs fats or lipids and protein during that period it was 41 carbohydrate 40 about 42 from fats and 17 from protein now i'm just going to highlight a few aspects of my my intake here and i should note that again this is the average intake this isn't one day before the test or a week before before the test this is my average dietary intake for the whole 43 day period that corresponds to the blood test so first we can see that the my average fiber intake during this period was about 87 grams per day and that's purposely high in order to optimize the gut microbiome and for more info on that i also have many videos on uh the ability of fiber to optimize the gut microbiome and i'll leave that in the right corner if you're interested to check it out all right other things that i'm paying close attention to are total fructose intake so sucrose which is also indicated there by the red arrow is comprised of 50 fructose so if you combine that 50 of about 37 with the 56.5 grams of fructose you get to about 75 grams of fructose per day which does seem like a lot uh i eat a lot of fruit but that's actually on the low end of my range for me and i'm trying to shoot for a little bit lower but i love fruit and you know i eat a lot of berries so that's where it's coming from and the reason i i'm keeping an eye on my fructose intake and trying to shoot for lower the lower end of my range it's because relatively high levels of fructose in my data is correlated with lower ldl i mean values as low as 40 or below so i've got to keep a close eye on that because i want to get it to about 50 or higher which is what has been shown to be associated with maximally reduced uh all-cause mortality risk and i also have a video on that so if you're interested in that check it out all right also on this list is uh omega-6 and in my data i haven't mentioned this before in other videos but relatively higher uh levels of omega-6 dietary omega-6 and are correlated with higher homocysteine which is going in the wrong direction so for this blood test coming up for the next one i intend to take out the b12 the methyl b12 to limit my omega-6 intake and that's coming from most i mean it's exclusively whole foods these aren't from omega-6 rich oils it's mostly walnuts and pecans that i'm getting my omega-6 content so i'm going to try to shoot for less than 10 grams per day i'll probably end up somewhere around 7 or 8 grams per day and we'll see if it actually plays some role in impacting my homocysteine levels all right what about vitamins and minerals and again this is the average vitamin and mineral intake over that 43 day period that corresponds to my latest blood test so just some highlights and again i have videos for all of you so if you're interested in more uh please check it out so first notice the beta carotene intake which is uh 58 000 micrograms so that's about 58 milligrams per day in my data relatively higher levels of beta-carotene are associated with higher albumin and higher albumin is found in youth and is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so i shoot for relatively high levels of beta-carotene every day also note of my vitamin c intake so the rda is somewhere around or it's actually less than about 100 milligrams per day so for this dietary period i was about 600 milligrams per day so that's six times the rda and one reason for that is because there is a meta-analysis that's been shown to um that there's a dose response for higher blood levels of vitamin c with reduced all-cause mortality risk now what the upper limit is should i should i take in a thousand milligrams per day i don't know but for now it's at least six times the rda now also higher than the rda or what's been defined as an adequate intake is my vitamin k intake and the adequate intake ai for vitamin k is about 100 100 micrograms per day um maybe 120 somewhere around there depending on if you're a man or a woman so i'm i'm about 19 times higher than that and the re one reason for that is because there is data that suggests that vitamin k intake is greater than a thousand micrograms per day and again i have a video on that if you're interested in that data please check it out so i shoot for relatively high intakes of vitamin k including green leafy vegetables like spinach all right so in terms of my average daily mineral content we can see that here and just to highlight we can see my selenium intake at about 182 micrograms per day and i also have a video on that um showing that selenium intakes up to about 200 micrograms per day may be optimal so that's my upper limit uh you know so i've got about 182 micrograms per day of selenium for this blood test all right so as a last note by tracking diet in conjunction with blood biomarkers i believe i'm working towards identifying the dye composition and the macro and micronutrient amounts that best optimize the composite of blood biomarkers not just glucose or triglycerides or lipid panel or kidney function but the net of all of them which would be expected to maximize health and potentially longevity all right that's all i've got for now if you're interested in more you can check us out
