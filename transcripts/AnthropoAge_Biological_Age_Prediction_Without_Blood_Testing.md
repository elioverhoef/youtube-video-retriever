# AnthropoAge: Biological Age Prediction Without Blood Testing

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

If you're familiar with the channel biological age testing is a big part of the approach for potentially slowing aging for example there are many videos on the channel using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno but also aging.ai but can biological age be predicted without blood test data so in today's video we're going to take a look at anthropo age which attempts to integrate body composition measures into the estimation of biological age and potentially more importantly no blood tests are required to assess biological age so a first and obvious question should be how does how good is anthropo ag how does anthropo agage compare with pheno ag so as we'll see enthropy ag is as good as pheno ag for associations with all cause mortality and these data were generated using the enhan 3 and four studies which included more than 177,000 people so first in looking at all cause mortality risk as shown there and when evaluating two different anthropo ag measures including anthropo agage and s or simplified anthropo ag and i'll have more on that in a minute and comparing those two measures against pheno wage we can see that the hazard ratios for both anthrop wage measures were above one and also the data in parenthesis which is the 95% conf confidence interval that two was above one in other words enth thruple wage is significantly associated with all cause mortality risk as is pheno wage so we can see that that's also true the hazard ratio is above one and the data in parenthesis the 95% confidence inter interval also above one so both measures anthropo wage and phenoage are both significantly associated with all cause mortality risk in the nanes 3 and four studies similarly anthropo wage is as good as pheno wage for associations with cause specific mortality too and for the cause specific mortalities those included cardiovascular disease diabetes stroke cancer influenza or pneumonia kidney related issues including nefritis or nephrosis deaths related to alzheimer's disease and chronic lower respiratory disease for each of these outcomes we can see that anthropo was significantly associ associated with them both in terms of their hazard ratio and again for that data in parenthesis the 95% confidence interval was completely above one as was pheno we can see the data in parentheses and the hazard ratio both completely above one so from these data we can conclude that anthropo ag is as good as pheno ag for associations with all cause and cause specific mortality so with that in mind what measures are included in anthropo so let's start off with the simple ifed or s anthropo age and i've put my data here just to illustrate so first we'd have to enter chronological age height so one would need a tape measure weight or we'd need a body weight scale weight circumference so once again the tape measure and then you would enter your sex race or ethnicity and then we need to make sure to toggle the only estimate s andrle h to toggle that to the right then you click on submit and you get your predicted anthropo age or an anthropometric age in my case it's 48 .73 so then enthropy age subtracts that from my chronological age and i get a value of 1.47 which means that enthropy age acceleration is not accelerated and what that means is that my 10-year mortality risk would be lower than expected based on chronological age all right what about the full anthropo age how can we calculate that to calculate the full anthropo age we would need to use the tape measure for thigh circumference and then also the upper arm circumference so midpoint of the arm for arm circumference and midpoint of the thigh for thigh circumference for women they would need a skinfold caliper and that would be used to gauge this uh skinfold thickness on the back of the upper arm behind the triceps and also subscapular skinfold thickness so just below the scapula on the back and then we would need to toggle the only estimate s anthropo wage toggle that off so that we get the full anthropo age estimation and then click submit and we get a similar number 47 88 which that two because it's less than 50.2 my chronological age is uh non-accelerated so and again that non- accelerated means it's a 10-year mortality risk that is lower than expected based on chronological age so as a last note anthropo ag is free to use and i'll put the link for the uh for anthropo in the video's description so if you're interested in using it check it out all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including ned quantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link as all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
