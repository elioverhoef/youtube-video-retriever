## Transcript

Are there blind spots for blood-based biological age clocks for example levene's test includes glucose two biomarkers of liver function a biomarker of kidney function two biomarkers of red blood cell related markers the mcv and rdw uh markers of immune cells and inflammation including white blood cells uh the lymphocyte percentage which is lymphocytes divided by total white blood cells and then as a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein similarly aging.ai uh contains glucose two markers of liver function five markers of kidney function five red blood cell related measures uh two immune related uh biomarkers including total protein since albumin's already included and knowing that total protein equals albumin plus globulins the total protein measurement in aging.ai is likely a reflection more of globulins but also platelets and then the lipid panel including total cholesterol hdl ldl and triglycerides which are generally used as measures of to evaluate cardiovascular disease risk so note that biomarkers for all organ systems using these two measures levene's test and aging.ai are not included so with the goal of a more comprehensive representation of organ and or systemic health what other biomarkers can we include so with that in mind in today's video we're going to take a look at data from this recent pre-print and in that study they identified systolic blood pressure and lung function as potential contributors or contributors to the prediction of chronological age and as we'll see in a minute systolic blood pressure may also be a biomarker of brain age so what were the top predictors of chronological age in this paper starting with the data in women we can see that the top two predictors of chronological age were systolic blood pressure and the forced expiratory volume in one second or the fev1 so what is the fev1 so it's a measure of lung function and it's defined as how much air can be forced forcefully expired in one second now note that blood pressure and the fev1 contributed more to the to the prediction of chronological age relative to other blood-based biomarkers including two markers of kidney function urea in statin c hba1c glycated hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase which is found on levine's test so what about the data in men so once again the top biomarker for its contribution to the prediction of chronological age was systolic blood pressure and although it wasn't number two the fev1 came in third place for its contribution in terms of weight for the prediction of chronological age and note that these two biomarkers again the systolic blood pressure and the fev1 contributed more to the prediction of chronological age relative to other blood-based biomarkers including markers of kidney function again systatin c and urea so blood pressure's impact on cbd related outcomes may be obvious but it also may impact brain aid and that was shown in this paper optimal blood pressure keeps our brains younger now there weren't any pretty pictures in the paper but we can see that people who had an optimal bp which was identified in this study as a systolic blood pressure spp less than 115 and a diastolic blood pressure dbp less than 75 so those people had a significantly lower brain age and this was identified with mri so brain scans when compared with people who did not have blood pressure uh less than 115 over 75. So let's put this data into perspective by looking at how blood pressure changes during aging so for the systolic blood pressure we can see that there are relatively low values in youth with data for men in green and women in blue and then it consistently increases during aging such such that uh 90 year olds or older than 90 have systolic blood pressure average systolic blood pressure measurements that are higher than 130. What about the diastolic blood pressure and that's what we can see here so in youth relatively low in peaks in middle age and then it declines during aging such that uh older than 90 have also relatively low levels so when considering both the sbp and the dbp we can see that youth blood pressure and youth is characterized by values in the 1 8 108 to 118 over 65 to 67 range depending on if you're a man or a woman and in aged blood pressure average blood pressure readings would be somewhere in the 130 to 135 over 68 to 69. And i say age but this is advanced age so older than 90 years old now note that bp is a relatively easy measurement and it can be performed at home which is kind of an advantage over the blood-based biomarker test where you've got to actually go somewhere to have it drawn so what about the fev how does that change during aging let's put that data into perspective so the fev the forced expiratory volume in one second it declines during aging in both men and women and note that there are four lines here for both men and women including healthy non-smokers healthy smokers people who are sick which was defined as having the common cold or lung disease so sick and non-smoker or sick and smoker so regardless of the health status we can see that the or lung function fev1 peaks in youth somewhere around 20 years and then it consistently declines for both men and women now when complete when considering the fev1's importance as a chronological age predictor can we slow or prevent the age-related decline now to improve or slow the slow the decline tracking would be a first step so how can we track it so the fev1 is measured with a spirometer or a spirometer depending on how you pronounce it and i'm not sponsored by that company uh i was looking there are many spirometers and some of them are very expensive this is actually a relatively affordable one and i was looking for spirometers that have been used in published studies and actually this one has and use of the spirometer was compared against spirometry performed at the doctor's office and there was a an almost perfectly linear correlation between at home spirometry with that performed at the doctor's office so a correlation of 0.96 so i i haven't purchased a spirometer yet if anyone's currently using one or has used one please indicate it in the comments so i'm curious in terms of what everybody's using all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
