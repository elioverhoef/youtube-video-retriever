A sleeping respiratory rate greater than 16 breasts per minute is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so let's jump right in and take a look at that data so on the y-axis we've got percent mortality or percentage of people who died and this was up to 3 000 days after the initial assessment of the nighttime sleeping respiratory rate this is a relatively small study of 406 older adults that had an average age of 83.1 years and then we can see lowest all-cause mortality risk for the group that had a respiratory rate less than 16 breaths per minute as shown in green in contrast and increase all-cause mortality risk was present for the group that had a respiratory rate greater than 16 breasts per minute now one factor that may be related to these associations is an older age and that's because the group that had a respiratory rate greater than 16 breasts per minute was significantly older 83.4 years for the for the blue line group when compared with the group that had a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk with an average age of 82.9 years and we can see when comparing the ages 83.4 versus 82.9 and looking at the p-value the group that had a relatively higher respiratory rate greater than 16 breasts per minute was significantly older now in another study that of 20 about 2700 people with a little bit younger of a cohort 76.2 years we can see similar data so again we've got the higher all-cause mortality for people who had a nighttime sleeping respiratory rate greater than 16 breaths per minute for the line in blue n a significantly lower all-cause mortality for the group that had a nighttime sleeping respiratory rate less than 16 breaths per minute as shown in green and once again age an older age may be contributing to these data as the group that had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk had an average age of 77 years and the group that had a reduced all-cause mortality risk for a respiratory rate less than 16 breaths per minute had an average age that was 74 75.9 years which was significantly lower than the group that had the average age of 77. So age may be one factor that contributes to a relatively higher nighttime sleeping respiratory rate now there are several questions to it to address here first is these data indicate that optimizing the nighttime respiratory rate while sleeping may be important for health so then how top with with that in mind how is the respiratory rate calculated which factors affect the respiratory rate besides potentially advanced age which fitness trackers provide respiratory rate data so that we can track it and potentially optimize it and last but not least what's my data so let's go through all of these questions so first how is the respiratory rate calculated the sleeping respiratory rate is derived from heart rate or hr so on the y-axis here of this plot we've got heart rate plotted against time and then the respiratory rate is calculated with a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia in other words heart rate increases upon inhalation and then heart heart rate correspondingly decreases upon exhalation so each inhalation exhalation heart rate pair equals one breath so correspondingly a higher heart rate while asleep is associated with a higher nighttime sleeping respiratory rate and we can see that data here so this is a study of 10 000 men and women and that this is based on fitbit data so fitbit is at least one fitness tracker that can provide nighttime sleeping respiratory rate so on the y-axis again we've got the respiratory rate and breasts per minute and this time we've got heart rate or resting heart rate plotted in beats per minute on the x-axis and what we can see is that as heart rate increases above 45 beats per minute all the way up to 85. The corresponding lead the respiratory rate also increases now if we look at the data from the last slide with that 16 breasts per minute cut off for all-cause mortality risk we can see that people uh the the resting heart rate cut off for that uh for that respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute would be a resting heart rate of 75 beats per minute so for people who have a wrestling heart rate of 7 75 beats per minute it's possible that they've got a relatively high respiratory rate which would put them at an increased all-cause mortality risk all right so which fitness trackers provide respiratory rate data we already know fitbit but are there others so aura ring whoop and apple watch each provide respiratory rate data and now this is just a small snapshot there may be other fitness trackers that provide that data but i know for certain that these fitness trackers provide that data so we can see that here aura provides it we can see that they're in the right corner for whoop and we can also see it for the apple watch all right so then besides heart rate which factors impact the respiratory rate with the goal of optimizing it to below 16 breaths per minute so having a relatively higher bmi more specifically greater than 26 kilograms per meter squared is associated with a higher respiratory rate and we can see that here this is from the same study of 10 000 men and women derived from fitbit data so respiratory rate on the y-axis plotted against bmi on the x and then we can see as bmi is higher than 26 kilograms per meter squared we can see that the respiratory rate correspondingly increases and conversely the lowest respiratory rate in the study was found at about a bmi of 25 and actually lower is not necessarily better at least based on this population-based study we can see that people who had bmi is less than 20 it looks like they had higher respiratory rates relative to someone with a bmi of 25. Now this then raises the question is body weight significantly associated with respiratory rate at the individual level does my own data correspond to the population-based data so with that in mind let's take take a look at my respiratory rate data over the last uh 567 days as shown here so we've got respiratory rate on the y-axis and this is plotted against body weight and i've met i weigh myself every morning after number one and number two uh and this is again 567 days of data from march of 2021 through october of 2022. And what we can see is that the respiratory rate rr is significantly correlated with body weight in my own data with a correlation coefficient of 0.17 and a significant p-value 0.02 now although that's a weak correlation 0.17 it's still a significant correlation as shown by the p-value so what that suggests is that a higher risk tur rate is significantly correlated with higher body weight at least in my data it may be different for others and conversely a lower respiratory rate is significantly correlated with lower body weight again in my data and it may be different for others so these data are in contrast with that population-based study that i just showed where in my case the respiratory rate increases from a bmi of 23.6 up to 25.4 in the earlier study we saw that the lowest uh that that the respiratory rate declines from relatively low bmi's down to 25 and contrast might be my respiratory rate increases as my body weight has increased now another factor that may impact the nighttime sleeping respiratory rate is immune activation so we can start to see that here so when using that 16 breaths per minute cut off based on the all-cause mortality data we can see that only three days out of the 567 days that have track respiratory rate have been higher than 16 breaths per minute in my uh in my data and that's because on the night of vaccine dose number two it was exactly 16 breaths per minute and then for the day of and the day after vaccine dose number three it was again greater or it was greater than 16 breaths per minute so the only days i've ever had a respiratory rate greater than 16 breaths per minute was as a result of vaccination and more specifically probably the immune activation that's related to that which then raises the question do older adults with a respiratory rate greater than 16 breasts per minute have chronic immune activation whether that's through infection infection with undiagnosed infection with bacteria fungi viruses etc a topic for another day that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in epigenetic testing testing the oral microbiome at home blood testing tracking your diet or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all these links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
