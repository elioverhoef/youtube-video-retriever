# Ancient Alien Artifacts: Real or Fake?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey everyone today will be something completely different on the channel that may superficially seem off-brand from the conquer aging or die trying motto which has been completely focused on health and longevity optimization but conquer aging or diet trying doesn't just apply to health and longevity but other things too for example do i want to buy a house made of wood and aluminum siding which will be demolished in 100 years or would i prefer a house carved into the mountain which could last thousands that's a part of the conquer aging or diatrine brand similarly in terms of art would i want to own paintings that are a few hundred years old or artifacts that are thousands potentially thousands of years old so with that in mind today we'll take a look at artifacts that may indeed be thousands of years old or could be an elaborate fake either way i think it's fun to investigate so with that in mind today we've got aliencarvings.com and we're going to take a look at a bunch of their pieces so let's get into it so what do you have what do you have today for us well i i've got a a collection here that i've gathered from mexico from different places uh tula hildago abuelo stilisco those are the two primary ones but also from other states like guerrero the mijohan and the waka areas um lake sale all these places are producing um pieces that are coming up with abnormal results you know there's been carbon dating thermoluminescent testing on ceramics and when i say carbon dating they take the adhesives that have organic material and or for instance resin in a pipe and and test that not the actual stone itself but nonetheless uh the the results are consistent and they're ten thousand plus years old and um so that being said the government you know says all these pieces are false and i i purchased them as art you know i figured it was an elaborate hoax myself um you know the the piece is screamed that they had a store though and and there was something really interesting is is going between the different places i noticed that the story was the same and uh so i started collecting these things and researching these things about three years ago and uh you know now i've amassed a good amount of them and what was really crazy is is there was things that we started finding out like for instance they had phosphorescence and luminescence i can show you a brief example it's daytime right now so it's hard to see some of them but you can see these pieces are inlaid with intricate uh you know luminescent and phosphorescent type um things and and so that that was really interesting to me because a the people that sold it to me didn't even advertise this and b they um had no idea when i showed them they were blown away in fact they were asking me where to get the light that i had and uh so for me that was kind of odd um also the fact that these people down there collect these pieces they don't just sell them um you know they they have full collections of these things and and are attached to them in ways that that someone that's just you know trying to make a buck wouldn't um so yeah here i am three years later you know and and i've hit a brick wall in terms of of research like you can't just go to a university and say i want to carbon date this piece um it requires having archaeologists chain of command all of the proper credentials and things and so we we went through that and and we got people of the phd level to request the testing um you know we found these bone schools and we we really want to know because it's a lot tougher to fake bone than stone and so that gives us a big thing i'll show you what one of these looks like they look very similar to the the one found in the rodeo mountains back in 2001 and they've got the same type of carvings on the the skulls we found about a dozen of these you can see here a picture of some of the others but uh yeah trying to get the research on this is a brick wall the carbon dates the the dna testing um it's extremely tough you know i spoke with the gentleman in peru that has the the nazca mummies down there and it's the same thing for them i mean he's been working on it for five years and are just now found finally starting to get you know they have a positive affirmation that they're 2 000 years old and that they're you know not completely human and vegetarian and so it's cool to see that it is possible and and it's worth um diving into and that's where i'm at i just researched this and try to figure out the truth because the art spoke to me in a way that that knockoffs don't yeah all right so we got a lot to unpack there so let's start with the most obvious which is uh carbon dating right so i know on your website there um you you guys carbon dated at least one mask as you mentioned the glue or the organic resin that glues these you know so if you can hold up that one that you've got right in the middle you know you can see the blue stone so i guess where the blue stones were glued on the front right the blue stones on or blue and red yeah all these stones actually the bottom here that black piece is a solid piece and then it's glued on with all these other pieces of stone and inside of the the cracks here is this red glue yeah and that's the most abundance supply there is a glue that holds these on as well and this can be tested and it has been but the primary source is this this tremendous amount of red glue because a there's so much of it in the mosaic that you know testing different areas on there you should get inconsistent results if someone's uh messing with it i.e grinding a mammoth bone or something into it to mess with the age you know uh it's not prehistoric it's not millions of years old like you would find in in synthetic glues and modern fossil fuel glues so it's it's interesting that it hits a consistent 10 to 15 000 years across multiple different areas and styles and types of adhesives that's the other thing the adhesive types between tula and abuelos are completely different made 100 different they look different um so it's really interesting and they're both primitive type blues there's chunks and stuff in there it's not refined like you would expect a modern blue to be so so the the blue so the glues completely different separated by like 800 miles or so and but yet the artifacts are similar like the the overall scope of the artifacts like what we see being similar in terms of these stone skulls and you know stone depictions of maybe aliens or whatever whatever it is uh so so all right so starting with the carbon dating um so on your site after dating the glue i think one of them came up as 8 400 years old or or something like that somewhere in that range yes yep and then how how many so probably and actually it's 80 8400 bp so that's before present so i believe it's actually more like a what is that like 11 000 or 10 000 years oh wow yeah all right but then there were some that the carbon dating or um is it thermal luminescence am i saying that right yeah thermoluminescence that's how they test us ceramic they do like a core sample uh where they can see the last time it has been fired right so that on your site there were some pieces where they couldn't even deter german the age of it because either there wasn't enough you know because carbon will well degrade over time i'm not an expert yeah so they couldn't even uh carbon date it because there was so little carbon left in the sample that they couldn't put an estimated uh date on it which means it could be beyond their limit what was it like 50 000 years as the limit of what so some of these so some of these pieces could be as old as 50 000 years old i mean you haven't clearly carbon you can't clearly carbonate everything right no no definitely not i mean i wish i could carbonate more stuff with the universities just won't do it they refuse i mean they say that uh you know it could be unethically dug up uh they don't want anything to do with that um even private firms uh it's just they don't want to touch it for some purpose uh as soon as they figure out what it is you know the people that tested the resin for the pipe they called the owner of the lab called scott woltar who's a host of america unearthed he was the one that submitted the test and uh and then they said don't ever send us anything like this ever again i hate to say it's religion based but i imagine some people it would destroy their worldview if this stuff was real right and older a lot of wars and stuff have happened over religion and you can go back as far as to uh babylon and egypt you know there's the old kingdom the new kingdom and quite a few um questionable things that occurred in terms of war so i i definitely think there's been something going on and pulling strings at this and and if you go back to the most ancient of ancient texts you'll see that there's you know uh angelic type beings in in this war of of human souls and all these type of stories that could absolutely resonate with these pieces you know if true so i think that i don't know i'm not so sure i merge it into the angels and demons kind of thing but like if you consider that the bible is like 6 000 years old or so and some of these pieces maybe 50 000 years old or even older or in that range so eight thousand to fifty fifty thousand years that's a big time you know time gap to go from there to only 6 000 years you know ago so um all right wait so let's go back let's go back to that initial piece because the one that had the uh blue and red uh stones on it so if we if you could just hold that up right so you can see clearly the almond the almond eyes i mean this is not depicting a human character right so someone's got the imagination ah right so it's reptilian on one side of the face and the other side isn't reptilian right yep yeah so even that i mean uh but then you've got the the dna what we would interpret is probably dna going down the middle right and but so it's clearly something someone's either got a very vivid imagination to produce this or maybe those things were around i don't know i don't know what the truth is i have no idea right because there's the vivid part say say that again i said here's the vivid part so so wait i can barely i see wow wow wow so you got dna you got something in a bubble right so it looks like a a being or a human of some form or uh you know it doesn't have the normal shape of a gray the head wise so it's kind of more humanistic looking uh could be the creation of atom uh or the whole uh start of of you know human in itself this could be the the pre-flood story you know atlantis type times who knows you know tula is really interesting that the place that some of these pieces are found in mexico it's uh there's there's a story about where the atlanteans washed up and uh and that was was in tula and and so it's a which is basically in mexico right that was the city of gods who's to say i don't know there are people going to roast me and think i've lost my lost my mind but the fact is maybe some of this or all of it is real right maybe what was interpreted as gods was just uh uh an advanced civilization that either lived here before or came here and yeah right even that right there i mean the yeah yeah yeah the i'm not i'm clearly not a stone mason and if there are any people who work with stone uh please leave a comment but the the ability to chisel this so precisely in 3d i mean it's just amazing it just blows my mind i've never seen anything like this yeah me neither yeah you know it's just there's true beauty in it and like you said earlier it's a vivid imagination and um to that that you know if only one percent of these pieces are legitimate it still tells a large part of a story that that we're missing and so the the reason of research for me is is dramatic even if it's one percent you know there's things like this though uh that that are found in in um iraq and sumerian dissented areas that are called astrolabes and these are pretty complex to make and these carry a pretty um general form of the night sky so being able to translate this is not um extremely complicated then you can plug in the coordinates in the north star location and all that to uh to a super computer and and get a date of when that was the last time that it happened like that in the sky and there's numerous of these i mean i've got i think 10 of them total um and they all have different depictions and this one here has a a ton of writing on it um and it was found with this piece and it's like i don't know if it's like additional data from the sky but i mean it seems fairly complex in terms of just someone making a you know elaborate hoax so same with on the back of this one thank you it's got a fair amount of it almost looks like cuneiform but it's it's not it's like a proto-cuneiform um there are proto-cuneiform pieces that have been found that are you know multiple different iterations and it seems like it dates back till the the very beginning and what's funny is uh even you know symbols like this is masonic symbol is found in sumeria like 5 000 years ago like way before the masons were even thought of so it's kind of interesting to see those symbols carry through you know yeah so the astrolabes i mean those have been around though you know for maybe a couple thousand years i mean i think 5 000 is uh when the night sky was of the ones that they found in sumeria that they plugged it into the super computer and that's at least when when it was last depicted like that it doesn't mean that it was made then yeah but that's that's the picture that they were able to put onto that disc so yeah and i i think i saw someone say uh history is written in stone not on paper so if you were if you were a civilization you know that had some you know that was an advanced civilization like truly advanced maybe probably more than us you'd want to make it in stone right you'd want it to be found right because if it's paper and wood and all this other stuff that we're using today it's gone it's crushed in hurricanes and floods and everything else but stone must much less likely to you know to be destroyed so hang on so the flute there the lizard flute could you hold that because that's got a whole bunch of uh yeah actually uh yeah so you can see the writing i mean in whatever whatever they're trying to convey i mean uh and i think you you mentioned you know or someone has asked you about ai decoding this stuff but i think that's probably a way to go where you would catalog it in pictures and you know there's over 10 000 symbols that we've cataloged that's crazy there's no repetition there's no vowels there's no it's very bizarre yeah but yeah this is a a pipe um and it actually has resin still deep inside of there which is great i haven't tested it yet but i've got a full excavation data on this one and and a lot of chain of commands so um it's good we actually have like organic material in the freezer from this it dig sites and we try to do it as 100 legitimate as possible so when we finally do find a lab we can just get this stuff done you know nice so the skull before you before you go to that one i haven't seen that one yet the skulls are even more i mean impressive because especially the one you've got right there or the one you just passed these so i i've seen i've seen people say that these may be just cow i don't know cow skulls are vertebrate i don't know yeah you know we we had a a couple bone experts look at these because it does have a similar spinal connection uh to a cow there are some similarities to a cow but this is you know obviously a cow school is going to come out uh here and that the costco would have to be heavily modified with saws and and paul you know all this stuff to get it and and the both the bone experts said that when they examined these pieces that this bone right here if if you were to cut a cow skull open to keep this intact is near impossible they'd never seen it before on any of the specimens and they said that if the bone was intact it would be so fragile that you couldn't go like this this is super super hard and the bone density and mass of this specimen is not that of a of a cow so they say it has some relation to a cow in terms of the way it is but it's not and so that being said um i find it interesting that you know we hear of all these cattle mutilations from ufos and they take out the organs maybe they're harvesting the organs because they're closely related um so it's different too about those if they are skulls is that you said that they're bone and that they're not stoned so you've got the stone skulls and then you've got whatever those are as i guess bone skulls right yes exactly yeah so so if you know i hate to bring it to the longevity idea but if you were a long-lived society and i don't mean like a hundred years but whatever something longer than that and if you wanted people to find your artifacts and know about your culture they're not going to find bones in the ground what with the exception of what we just saw right but so you'd you'd want someone to find your replicas and maybe these are replicas of theirs their skulls only in in stone form right so and again i don't know if that's true but um yeah the handbags is also another thing right so it depicted so many in so many um megalithic structures right and here you've got a stone can you just hold it up so people can see how heavy that is yeah i mean 10 15 pounds what do you think 20 pounds i'm gonna say probably 15 12 to 15 pounds yeah yeah and it's a calcite dominant uh stone that's why it's uh like that it glows red phosphorescently and then it has all the luminescent detail on it but same with this one this one actually shattered uh during shipment unfortunately but you can see it's a full crystal all the way through the the piece you know and then are the handbag stones or all of these stones are they found in ojueles or in tula uh tula hildago and auelo stilisco both i've got uh bags from both you know no i mean i mean the the stone like in order where are they getting this where did they get the stone from like is would you expect to find these stones like just on uncut undesigned stone in those areas yeah calcite is very common um green banded calcite is fairly common to these areas so it is possible this stone here is interesting because it's the way it's formed and the way it's put together you know it's very pitted um and and hard to work with and so for for that being said you know these right here are legs to a table so that has this hole right here for this crossbar to go in and the two legs sit there and hold this large disc the same weighs over 420 pounds and uh you know to hold that up and and know that this stone would be um structurally sound is really an engineering marvel in my opinion because a it's super fragile in most cases and it's very pitted so to be able to trust it with that kind of weight it blows my mind you know yeah definitely and plus a 400 pound stone i mean if someone's trying to make some fakes why are you going to make 400 pound stones if anything you'd want it to be small and mobile so everybody could buy it but it's going to be sure this was a nightmare you know oh i can imagine yeah so all right so we talked about problems getting the artifacts carbon dated uh the mexican government stance as you i think you mentioned that they said they don't believe any of this stuff because the mayans didn't worship it so that's why you're you have the ability to have it because they just don't believe that it's a real thing it's just somebody making it up right well they and that's that's a debated thing so the inaa has said that they've had these pieces being turned in for over 80 years and uh but they don't have a place for them in history so they do have a large amount of these pieces is what they said but they don't have anywhere to display them in the museum because it doesn't fit into history so um and they don't they don't have a way to validate that it's real it's very sketchy because they do have ways to validate it but they're not enacting them yeah i mean if it's gonna you know if it's gonna disrupt history and people have you know invested their world view in history it's just hard for people to change it seems like disclosure is something that is being collaboratively done at a proper speed in time like it's not something that they're allowing to slip up very easily that's for sure yeah so just going back to that stone skull right there on just to the left the mosaic yeah yeah so just to illustrate all of those different colors those are smaller stones that were glued together to make this large stone head right yep yeah so even that too i mean what like a 10 pound or so i mean what are we looking at there yeah about 10 pounds on this piece it's very heavy so you know the like when you look at like the megalithic structures that are all over the world and and then you know potentially older civilizations or younger civilizations that try to imitate it and either build on top of it or build to the sides of it and you can see differences in workmanship where the oldest megalithic structures like for example in peru were just you know basically this the megalithic stones are so perfectly uh joyful yeah yeah yeah so there was a level of precision that was involved there that later generations couldn't replicate and you can clearly see the difference i mean it looks like baboons trying to imitate you know some highly advanced with some highly advanced culture did so they for that stone skull there i mean it's gluing individual it's first it's making those individual little stone pieces and then gluing them together and you look at it and it's i mean it looks from you know i'm i'm not you know trained eye but from you know the untrained eye mind it looks flawless you know it doesn't look like some primitive baboon made it right so no impressive yeah and you got to think too that they they have to glue all this together and you can't just put all the pieces and put the glue in and just expect it to set like it has to be done like a section at a time right and then they have to sand it all and and then carve on top of it what if you make a mistake when you're carving on top then the whole mosaics ruined i mean it's ridiculous to carve on a mosaic like that to be honest definitely all right so you've mentioned that they've been turned in for about 80 years so and i think in one of your videos you mentioned plasma cutters so um the engraving that uh is on some of these stones is so precise that one potential option is that a plasma cutter was used so i looked up when plasma plasma cutters how that's super cool too but hang on so i looked up when plasma cutters were invented and it was 1950 so i mean plasma cutters have been around for 70 years so that they've been turned in 80 years so 10 years before plasma cutters were even invented i mean it kind of tells me that or what was what was using that level of precision to carve into these things so like this stone here is so smooth to the touch yeah you would not like if if you were blind and you were feeling this there's no way you would guess that this has a mural on it yeah you know what kind of stone even is that that it's green i mean it's green banded calcite so they were able to take calcite which is naturally white and somehow make it green no no uh there's green banded calcite out there yeah but yeah it's not super common in this quality um you know the replicas we've seen because they've replicated these green stones the carvings don't look the same it's easy to spot the symmetry and and whatnot but needless to say the specimen itself is is nowhere near the saturation and the quality like some of these pieces i have are extremely saturated this one here is over uh so it's close to 200 pounds yeah now this is very very big and then even the eyes there i think you mentioned that there that's gold leaf or it's yeah it's real you know uh i don't know 18 24 karat gold whatever it is well no that that's the peculiar part so for instance like on this bracelet there's all these different places with gold when you take an xrf scanner and scan the alloy it's not consistent first of all there's no purity at all it's between 12 and and you know some of them are 10 some of it's 15 carat um some of it has silver in it some of it has copper in it some of it has even rhodium um that's all unrefined 100 percent wow and then i think you mentioned too that radium was found in some of the gold samples so why is that important rhodium uh rhodium is uh it's uh like platinum but much more rare it's it's i think it's like three or four times the cost of gold so to find rhodium in a gold sample is just extremely rare so was it was it uh purposely put into the gold or the no no you'll find it just like platinum when you're refining gold or when you're finding gold you'll see that there's traces of other elements and and so it's not completely uncommon um to have you know that but in modern gold like if i was to go buy leaf off of you know the web or something like that it's all going to be 24 karat so they can weigh it out properly and get you the correct amount and you're not going to find the variance there let alone unrefined with other metals because it's not going to make as quality of a product in the end and people want quality products if they're going to be using gold on it so it's uh it's weird so so whoever made these pieces had to tap that gold out themselves and and it's not just on a couple pieces this is across dozens and dozens of pieces even on on like this armadillo here um his eyes are gold oh wow you can see it's not a very high purity um i think this one was only like nine carrots but still it's gold you know yeah all right so let's take a look at that mask that you have in the in the case the uh yeah alien mask because this one too it's got writing all over it it's a mosaic um it's a pipe pipe wow i mean that's just crazy uh what's on the back i don't know you gotta go slow with this sort of stuff yeah also heavy right i mean that's another what 10 pounds no this actually is only it's actually meant to hold up to your face and smoke out of so it's it's probably only three pounds that's crazy if there were aliens ten thousand years ago they're getting they're blazing they're blazing the green or whatever they were smoking well it was tobacco is what we found in the resin samples at least it was majority tobacco and maybe some other roots and stuff but no cannabis no ayahuasca or any of the vines that contain that sort of stuff so yeah that was obviously the question for me because some of this stuff is it's borderline psychedelic looking you know yeah and the sauces are even i mean more impressive like uh i mean you've got that which is a disc but yeah you've got a saucer there classic saucer saucer shape this one blows my mind here i uh i mean this is your typical abduction scene right here there's like a lady with this helmet on and um two guys standing over the top of her in a saucer wow crazy i never thought about it like that i just thought it was a person in the middle i but it could be i guess abduction right i don't know i mean it's weird i've never seen a helmet like that depicted on any other piece and the fact that her genitalia is uh depicted is is interesting of why they would go through that extension unless it was of significance you know yeah and then the step pyramid i mean stone balls too like so uh clearly i don't know the difficulty in making a stone ball a spherical ball but can you just grab that that ball and just uh i mean there's got to be some level of difficulty in making these things where you know i even have one and i i you asked me to grab it but i unfortunately could not grab it it was way too deep um i have a lot of stuff in safes and things but uh one of them's a full mosaic ball like this and that's the crazy one to me because to create a sphere out of stone isn't easy out of mosaic is just ridiculous you know yeah and then in the back we can see they had rings stone rings and then you've mentioned that that there i mean that one looks like a small stone ring but they're super large stone rings and super large pendants like you know yeah very large here i'll show you this one this one's crazy um it's absolutely very large um i'll put it next to this bottle here you can see yeah i mean it's just it's amazing to me because if there was some advanced civilization 10 000 or plus years ago that they're still that they that they care about you know pendants and you know just fashion things you would you would imagine would be irrelevant to uh uh you know potentially space traveling you know civilization right so yeah yeah and that's and that's the thing you know is it is it uh exactly that or or was this more of what the anunnaki story talks about i mean are these grays the ajiji or or previous races uh that inhabited here before endless you know spaz i i don't know but if you read those stories um there's definitely something to it i don't take it word for word in terms of the translations but there's definitely a core there that that seems to be really relevant to the book of enoch the only argument i would have against that is if the gigi were uh you know subservient to the anunnaki so i can't imagine that a subservient civilization even though they may have been more advanced than whatever humanity was if if that all of that is real could create such i mean masterpieces you know none like like i said none of this stuff looks like it's uh out of place or you know jagged edges or you know created by an advanced technology was used for sure just like the pyramids just like a lot of this stuff i mean there's those durai statues in egypt there are carved to such precision to look like you know immotep and stuff there's just no way unless you have something advanced i don't think we have a way to replicate that in derive today yeah that's an interesting one there too the cylinder uh so you got basically the top is saucer right oh wait yeah it pulls up out of there there's three guys inside of it that come out that are all adorned with you can see the core is made of a ceramic of some form or a stone and then they glue on the top of it so i i never saw the inside of that why why would they why would they make it like what do you think what's going on with the inside i mean it kind of looks like a they're just frozen you know frozen in carbonite kind of in the middle there yeah it's weird i don't want them to fall out because uh oh you can see there there yeah one-handing that one's not possible but uh yeah it's it's a it's a very immaculate piece there's golden light into this piece um as well here ah that's another one with the the i don't know what you would call it hybrid or you know you've got the almonds gates of duality uh is depicted in in many of these pieces you can see uh trying to find another example like right here is another one yeah um but but the one thing i notice about these is notice the eye shape and the position of the eyes is different and and it varies from piece to piece but but it's consistent some of them look human on one side some of them look reptilian on one side so that's something i've noticed is the dualities are different states yeah yeah i don't know what to make of that i mean my first thought is you know just going back to the hybrid thing whether that was a real thing or not but maybe they were transit transitory states where someone was representing in their mask like i'm half this and half that i don't know yeah and that's i mean it's showing genetics so that it could absolutely be and you know we have scaly skin so that's always kind of been a mystery uh some of the things that put us together to create us or or differentiate us from you know primates and stuff like that uh i think it's interesting you know in terms of uh the way our chromosome mutated and how intelligence was actually born on on you know us versus our predecessors it definitely doesn't seem like an accident they've ran those odds through supercomputers and it comes up with impossible odds you know 10 to the 500 or more and that's crazy yeah i mean we're 99.9 something percent uh primate you know evolved from you know monkeys right so uh i i don't know what i don't know what the truth is hang on wait can you go back to that piece you just had because yeah the other thing yeah the other thing about it if it was fate how do you fake the weathering i mean the the like how can you make something look as old as that looks they have methods i mean i've studied this a lot and i've looked at a lot of these pieces and i've been i've identified pieces that are fake absolutely what they'll do is they'll put it in a rock tumbler or some sort of uh cement mixer with certain types of sands and rocks and things and it'll sit there and spin with it and get uh naturally worn and stuff like that well not naturally war but um it'll look like it's old but it's not you know then they just cover it with dirt and stuff so i've i've rinsed a lot of pieces off and and uh you know started from from bread and butter to see what was underneath all the dirt because that's really important and then they say not to remove that stuff and i don't on most pieces but it had to be done just to know you know wouldn't that wouldn't putting it in some kind of rock tumbler wouldn't that destroy or increase the chances of you know breaking some of the pieces absolutely yeah so that would kind of argue against it because if they're going to try to age it you know uh superficially there's going to be some percentage of pieces that break and it's just a waste of time and effort right that they're going through i mean i i think on the smaller pieces like this that that no that's not the case yeah when you're talking something like this yeah yeah i i cannot see them putting this in a tumbler man there's no way that you would get all the way done with the etchings and perfecting this on a mosaic and be like yep let's go ahead and age it now you know there's just no way that doesn't make sense for sure yeah it's really bizarre too you know a lot of these pieces i'll show you something kind of unique you know they have these holes drilled into them um let's see here if you can see that like there you see the hole there in the hole here yeah also on this this top piece here you can see there's a hole again and then um for instance on this pendant so you got this pendant the two gems have holes drilled through there and and i just you know you can put a light behind here and it'll illuminate the gemstones um which is interesting you know because a lot of this stuff plays with light and uh what what is also interesting is you see the anunnaki depicted on a lot of these and if you read through the anunnaki stuff you'll read that they they had a splendor about them um in terms of a light that they put off or a halo and it's the same with the old people in the bible like methuselah um they would light up a room just by entering is what it said so if this was the case what if that light had ultraviolets in it the spectrum and caused these pieces to naturally illuminate and just by wearing this piece the the eyes would illuminate by being on one of these beings with this blood of uh whatever caused them to glow you know anunnaki bloodline yeah i i don't know it could be anything i hear you but it could be anything right it could be oh just theories man i i have to think about this stuff because you know to wrap my mind around it and swallow the pill that it's even real is really hard so i have to really try to understand what the what's going on here and and man it's it's way deeper than i ever imagined i would go i'll tell you that much definitely and if there are pyramids too so there are there are a few pyramids stone carvings i'll show you a really crazy one here let me grab my light too so you can see inside of this thing you know there's different pyramids like this have pieces inside of it um little pine cones and acorn looking calcite pieces and we see a lot of the pine cones and handbags but for instance like this pyramid here it's got an odd shape to it it looks more like the ones found in sedan oh actually i can do this and it'll look much better i'm so sorry i have no idea um but this has a weird slot here you can see and and it came with this this key a pegged key and you put it in here and it'll allow you to push this little pin up and so you can see this this block is now locked in here i could turn it upside down and it's locked and so there is a primitive type of a latch thing it's not a spring loaded um let me get it out of here now okay but that's stone somehow they made they made a stone lock yeah it's it's definitely taken some practice um to understand it because it's just so uh like i just wouldn't have guessed it to be like that i guess you know and then what's what's in there when you take that piece out i'm trying to get it out of here so give me one second yeah i'm gonna actually set you down so i can do this properly here so give me one second here just don't want to break something you know yeah i mean you basically have like the museum of alien carvings it's great yeah i mean it's turned into that it's absolutely crazy you know we got close to 600 pieces now or a little over 600 pieces i got it out awesome you can see here inside the hole i got my light i'll show you um it's full of carvings a which is incredible yeah they've got this primitive lock system you see the notch there behind the notch there's a little peg you can barely see it that's how i didn't notice it but that's what the key pushes in and and it pops out um and you just use the gravity of the piece to to have it lock it in there and a whole bunch of them outside and a whole bunch of engravings on the inside i saw i think i see a dna on the top dna in there and aliens in there as well as language and it's all illuminated too it's been inlaid with the glowing in there as well and then the piece here see it almost reminds me of the the stuff on the fifth element you know those blocks that they were chasing around the universe or whatever uh old movie from the 90s but yeah it's uh it's interesting to see some of the sci-fi and some of the the things that just made me really scratch my head because first of all you know i got this piece from the mihohan and i thought for sure i had them i'm like this is fake for sure look at this okay it looks like the xenomorph and i'm like yeah that's that's bs you know yeah and then gen 6 gen 6 productions is down in tula hildago you know a place that's like 600 miles away and they got full coverage uh you know dig videos start to finish of this coming out of the ground and i don't know if you saw a recent post but i mean there's a full cave system and and there's aliens on the walls and so it's really hard for me now to be like what the heck you know what is this real are there really xenomorphs i mean it blows my mind to even question that you know yeah uh this whole this opens a whole world of like did they if it's real did they come here did they live here did they evolve here are we products of somehow whatever they did i mean there's so many questions right so um yeah it's it's a it's a beautiful um thing to research and to have this i've gone into deep history of multiple religions and cultures and i feel like i've educated myself a lot just because of really curiosity at this point you know or or or it's just somebody's brilliant imagination it's like the banksy of stone carvings right yeah and if that's the case i want to shake this person's hand so bad because they they got me and then they got it so good and they were so correct that they're they're a genius i mean they really are they deserve to be credited um and i say that too like because there's you know i'm a musician this is a whistle so i'll show you i'll play this here for you real quick it uh it's it's so in tune and so just pure sounding [music] but you know you put that into a tuner and it's it's right on the money so it's a tune a stone skull that weighs 30 pounds um just nuts you know so you're saying from your musical background that's tuned what what music yeah i ran it through a guitar tuner and and it's and it's right on the notes of uh i think it was i think c d and f or something like that if i remember right it's crazy so some of the some of the pictures depict uh beings like blowing into the air and i don't know if that's them singing or maybe it's the flute frequency i i don't know it's a great question there's quite a bit of it in abuelos especially more so than tula that i'd seen however in this cave system that i just mentioned uh there's actually a depiction of one of the aliens blowing out the uh the thing that you're speaking of i'm trying to find a um a depiction of it here real quick so we can put it together too many pieces actually i think it's there's one on this maybe no but yeah it's it's super interesting i mean you take a piece like this all these little circles around here are all individually cut and laid in there with with heads and different symbols on them and then on the back they're all drilled and so if you lay this up to a light you can see here they light i mean it's not this isn't the best light but you can see the light through and these things illuminate so it's like a what was on the back of that what was it on the back of that uh i've seen that piece before complex little uh yeah piece you know it's got this scale here this it seems like a scale maybe but bizarre looking i don't know yeah some of the technology depictions and and things of that nature are just mind-blowing because i've never seen anything like it even just like this language i've never seen these symbols ever yeah and then there are some like stone astronauts i think you've got a couple a few of those yeah yep this guy here yeah any chance you could pull that out so we could take a look at what's on the inside because when you open it up it's just amazing absolutely i mean it's like it's like uh stone carvings for kids like if you had kids and you have these little you know toys i mean it's like stone toys i mean it's just yeah again it's either brilliant or just you know whatever i mean you know so this helmet comes off of here yeah and what's interesting you know is this red glue that glues all this together you can see the inside is just caked with this red glue yeah yeah they repaired this helmet it cracked at one point wow but it came out of the ground cracked and repaired already so that having traces of repairs and stuff on these pieces is also a pretty good inclination that it's you know in the ancient glue um because i've seen the guys locally when they break the pieces pulling it out of the ground and it's always super glue every time there's never been one uh where it's just you know oh yeah we repaired this with the red glue it's always super glue you can always spot it they're horrible with it it kills me um as you can hear the tone of my voice so you know it's you're frustrating when they don't do a good job you know but yeah another important thing i mean seeing uh seeing the craftsmanship and the amount of inlays on these pieces is just it's a lot of work yeah not easy to cut stone you know and just to reiterate that's a stone astronaut with a removable head like you said that it broke and they glued it back together i mean this isn't some plastic toy this is completely carved out of stone i mean it's just amazing do you have other yeah and then we go again with the you know alien iconography i mean it's just uh there's the the thing coming out of his mouth too yeah and so what we're what we're thinking or what we've been able to kind of visualize based off of seeing all this is that that it's possible that these beings are are like multi-dimensional and can maybe you know through the mouth blow their soul out or something i i mean that's kind of what it seems because some of them actually come out and then it shows the the character animation into um a being with a little wispy thing behind it like uh you know something like this where it's not a there's no feat uh yeah and yeah i don't i don't know if i buy the multi or trans here we go right here so you'll see some of them blow out the thing oh yeah it's right on here perfect the guy's blowing it out and it out comes this yeah breathing out life i don't know so it's interesting because uh the i don't know about these things or even whatever is going on at skinwalker being trans-dimensional i just think that i think it's possible that evolution speed is geared into evolution so if you notice i don't know how closely you watch skinwalker but they have it from uh like the fastest uh cameras in terms of uh lens speed faster than the eye can detect and then when they roll the camera did you see that you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah coming in and out of the mountain and i mean the stuff that they've captured is breathtaking have you did you watch the brandon fugle interview uh from uh i think his name's nick or something like that but it's like a it's like a four hour interview with brandon fugel and i'm telling you what i highly encourage it because he goes into details that are not on that show and it really gives a full circle of how he got the ranch from bigelow and and what maybe more is going on there i mean you have to look the the travis taylor was was working with the government for years while working at the ranch getting paid by brandon fugle so brandon fugel is basically paying a government agency person to do work at his ranch and and so uh he's cool with it now but the story of how travis taylor was given to skinwalker or proposed to skinwalker was through the history channel the history channel brought him to brandon and i find that interesting because prometheus entertainment owns ancient aliens they own oak island and they own skinwalker and all these shows have real truth to them but they seem to be little breadcrumbs and a trail that never ends you know ooh piece of candy ooh piece of candy but it's it's like they're controlling this like a a faucet and they're not giving out the um the conclusive research and and i know this because i've contacted so many people from ancient aliens and talked with linda moulton al for six months and and stuff regarding this topic and they know all about it but it's completely lip sealed and and my point is if you're a ufologist and this is your passion and and you've put 50 years into this why wouldn't you try to disprove something like this that's making your subject and your passion look foolish um in reality because this if it's fake is is just hurting the alien community you know what i mean well i think i think it's easier said than done to try to you'd need people with specific expertise to try to disprove this stuff like geologists we've got them and we've got them we've got we've got geologists forensics geologists we've got phd bone experts we've got um all kinds of people that have the proper degrees and and scott woltor specifically has submit and been told no by like 14 or 15 different labs yeah but i think travis is i'm not i don't think travis is legit scientist now the whole entertainment versus you know research he's a legit scientist i i play zero doubt on the stuff he's doing there but in terms of the what i was what i was going to say about skinwalker in terms of cameras that have a lens you know the lens speed that's way faster than the human eye so i wonder if there's some aspect of evolution where highly advanced civilizations they're not you know they're whether it's their i you know their ability uh first of all our senses can only detect you know we evolve to detect things just for survival so who's to say a million years from now whatever humans can evolve into won't be designed for speed right so and you know so our primitive senses maybe can't detect what the full nature of reality is so it goes back to transdimensional versus just the highly advanced civilization maybe millions of years into the future in terms of evolution of their species just evolving to the point of speed where you know what we receive as a glimpse in time in a millisecond to them you know it's it's you know anyway yeah it's just like the the james webb being able to see beyond the big bang i mean it's it's all about how how much uh or how far you can look you know and and seeing that there's something before that is is really relevant you know yeah so what do you got here i see the saucer i see the yeah this was just it's a really interesting piece uh this piece has been out of the ground for over 10 years um documented wise and and it's um it just you know it's obviously this large mothership looking thing it's it's quite the the piece it's got the stepped pyramid on there uh the depictions are pretty amazing but yeah this back piece is why i brought it out just because it's got a lot of this um you know spaceship with with what almost looks like planets or or or uh you know this looks like the moon almost maybe it's got big craters i mean spaceships pushing it with a beam or something i mean or did they put the moon in position is that what this is depicting because you've got saturn here um it's very interesting it's almost like they're rearranging our solar system or something you know what i mean yeah so i thought about that saturn iconography but i imagine that the universe is filled with planets that have rings that we would interpret a saturn but maybe where they come from that's their no i i don't know it could be anything you know well i would say that too however um i have documented multiple pieces that show specifically the the well here i'll show you one right now um that you just can't argue it because it's got jupiter's guests little rings on there and i mean this is definitely what we got going on here yeah see that's a man i mean you got a person right it's a person what what are they juggling planets i i don't know man yeah your guess is as good as mine i i have a million guesses but it's it's definitely like you said earlier it's it's one hell of an imagination regardless and it's yeah definitely and so these things give off electromagnetic uh radiation you know or alexa right so yeah cool the tri-field yeah so i was thinking like have you considered cataloging you know so i don't know what spectrum are you are you in right now uh this is just the electromagnetic frequencies on a standard level so maybe there's a way to catalog it based on their emf emission what's what's odd is it changes um it changes all the time like sometimes they'll pop up really like right now this is way higher than it was last night when i did this wow 180 is really high for wow so yeah zara i have no explanation on this there's no real scientific merit of what's going on here but i've seen it on skinwalk or ranch that they were getting odd readings and so i bought a a spectrum monitor i bought the tri-field meter i got a geiger counter just to make sure um there was nothing radioactive considering it all glowed green um and we're clear there but yeah no no real idea what it means that they produce this energy but it is consistent i've had numerous collectors tested i've tested it outside you know i've never tested it in a faraday cage but that would be my next move to see variance and monitor them more accurately i have used frequencies and different tuning forks and synthesizers to produce um harmonic tones that could possibly interact with that emf or fluctuate it and i haven't been able to see anything there but it's a common question that i wanted to address yeah interesting and then so what would your phone give off in terms of emf like if you held it next to your phone um that's a good question i uh let me see if i can get it what's a background background's just zero right and now i'm getting it closer and closer to my phone you can see it's not moving at all so no emf that's you know most people are worried about like wi-fi you know and so basically no emf coming off the trifle very little oh you're going closer to the yeah it's crazy i'm just pulling it back towards me now as close as i can get it you can see it's down to five or four and then you go closer to the pieces and so do rocks give off emf normally i mean is that yeah i i've definitely gotten things to put off emf um so that's why i say i don't have a scientific explanation on this specifically but what i can tell you is that the consistency and and how you can move two inches right to left like if i touch the scanner here it doesn't show anything uh but if i go just inches from one to another you can see the dramatic difference like i was just showing so the fact that it spikes up above 100 and and the fact that it's that you know consistent to the piece that that's the part that definitely are peculiar i think it makes me think maybe it thinks uh so maybe it's uh the organization of the pieces so if you if you align certain pieces next to others they'll have a different emf that they give off individually that's definitely possible yeah i i was thinking that you know it could be something to do with planetary a magnetic field energy as well um you know what i'm saying like the planet's magnetic field is always changing so uh it could very well have to do with if we're getting hit with solar flare who knows right but um but like this piece here for instance it shows this guy with this pendulum and i i found numerous pendulums and and i found numerous depictions of them and what's really crazy is there's a guy that i interviewed in a waylo steel uh when i first started before i ever seen any of these pendulums and he said when he was 12 years old that he had contact with with aliens right and they taught him how to go and find these pieces and and so what's interesting is they've been finding these pieces for a long time geo radar and gpr has only come onto the scene in the last few years and i think that's why this is exploding so much now is because people are getting it more cost effectively and you can afford it you know to do it down there before it was twenty thousand plus dollars and it was out of range but um but i i think that that's a big factor that he he said that the the the beings taught him how to use this pendulum they gave him a pendulum it looks like the all-seeing eye i've seen it it's got gold on it and um and he'll take it on a string and go out there and look for areas of cactuses or rock form nations he'll hold this thing over there and sometimes it starts tugging on him and i thought he's just bsing but i mean he keeps bringing the pieces so it's very strange now so my point of that is is okay if these things really are producing an emf and there really is something in his um pendulum that he has that that could interact with that emf it's possible it could have some sort of police i don't know right but interesting on a science level right yeah so maybe the emf is linked to the luminescence right because when you hit the black light on them i don't know we haven't done that it doesn't affect it doesn't affect the emf with the black light now and like in these pieces here uh i'm not going to be able to show you but but these here will have a phosphorescent glow they won't glow green and show you they don't you know there's no green on them but they will still emit a phosphorescent glow after you turn the light off and uh and that's more of a geological thing i think it's because of the amount of calcite they seem to use calcite in almost every one of these pieces um obviously not the quartz or the jade but uh in almost every piece there's calcite and i think there's something really important there because you know you've got this this pineal gland or this eye depicted everywhere a lot of people call it the pineal gland because it's got the proper things coming off of it and it looks just like it um if that's the case you know you look at that gland and what it produces chemically for your body in terms of dreams and all kinds of things um it definitely depicted on on these pieces as like a portal and uh so if that's the case well there's a recent study about the pineal gland and when using ayahuasca they were able to see that there's micro calcite crystals in the pineal gland that harmonically resonate when uh put in in under the influence of of dmt so it's bizarre that there would be calcite in our body like that let alone all these pieces have to do with this type of uh you know ritual type stuff so i'm going to look more into that that's the first i'm hearing about it so yeah i'm gonna definitely look more into that you know some crazy weird pieces and and stuff i'll bring these over so you can see a little better in terms of the emf and the you know the the the green and the you know chemiluminescence or or whatever the luminescence that comes off of it but i'm not trying to say that the emf will go down or up because of that but maybe you the green color is because of what whatever's emitting the electromagnetic you know radiation right you wouldn't see it with your eye but once you turn the lights off then because it's emitting that that's what you see in terms of chemiluminescence i don't know maybe i'm at that side of that field but it's definitely it's possible on the tulip pieces for sure that have that luminescence but these pieces that don't have it still have the emf so that would that's the weird part you know yeah gotcha so the claw yeah yeah i mean what the heck is this this is a piece of like egg and it's it's crystal you can see uh you know again with the light but yeah it's a interesting piece for sure very interesting i mean they made a lot of animal based you know replicas right like so i guess there's a beetle there's turtles snakes lizards scare about yeah yeah i mean it's like they must have had that's another thing if it was an ancient civilization this is like the pinnacle of their civilization is to make stone artwork i mean there's got to be other stuff right i mean oh oh i mean there's there's definitely ceramic you know but the the artwork is insane i i can only think that you know obviously that it wasn't just this though it's not just this think about what you said earlier with the stone age all over the world yeah think about india and the amount of art engraved onto their temples yeah like this wasn't just these guys you know what i mean this was a worldwide thing this is the this is the the the the dollar store this is the dollar store and the megalithic structures was their big grand design right so yep yeah wow this is crazy so there were coffins too i don't know we saw a couple coffins but uh that's that's another interesting one yeah definitely confidence from both areas uh fairly intricate you know nice so so there's got it so there's a superficial where i see it a few times or more than a few times because i'm checking your instagram and your tick tock every day looking at these things and even trying to study it and try to get the sense of what is the story here what story were they trying to tell but since you're actually living with hundreds of these pieces like what story what store do you think this tells well i think it tells the story of all of our cultures and and why we are the way we are why there's the races that we have why there's our genetic changes and and all the different experiments on this planet you know we have all these plant species and all these species of life here um and it creates this balance and and i think that we're seeing that that there is is um bigger things at play i think that's the big cap here is that there's bigger things at play i'm tuning this planet for our inhabitants um and i think we can see it throughout even in our dna today the human dna is evolving faster than any other species on this planet and we have proof of that so it how's that working in that nature you know and evolution the whole darwin's theory you know we don't really see any sort of um you know by now we you think we'd monitor some sort of of evolution and it's not there so so i heard lou elizondo talking about if you were an ancient civilization and you wanted stuff to last a long time dna would be the way you would tell that story because dna is basically immortal right so yeah so who's to say there aren't copies of whatever that created this if it is real in our genome right just and we just don't know if we just interpret it as genes and you know we may have not been able to translate it or or who knows you know it's just like how they found the the you know yahweh symbols or whatever in our in our rna um it's it's definitely interesting ah stone watches right so that too i mean like what it's it's one this one's pretty crazy i've got one that looks just like the uh the sumerian anunnaki you know relief one um it's in the safe but yeah very very interesting designs and also very big right like when you put it on your wrist it's bigger than yourself this will actually fit me uh fairly well but some of them are massive yeah like there's there's no way um and it's the same with the rings like some of them are so big that you just even a 350 pound football player is not going to be able to put it on i'll show you this guy here is it's really impressive the work in this bracelet yeah you know it's mosaic just think it's hard on the inside it's so what's on the inside well i can't really see uh they're symbols you can see the symbol here and i know the focus is really uh rough and zoom for some reason i mean i've never seen a stone wristband ever i mean i don't know how you even in the even in the replicas and stuff like you don't see that type of stuff let alone cups and vases and look at this bowl this bowl is just ridiculous oh it's probably 20 pounds yeah and it's got metal you can see these metal inlays yeah right here and we see this deity here which is found in egypt as well um not not commonly but it's there so in austin you see a lot of egyptian symbols like you asked earlier you know have you been able to translate anything and and so symbolically yes you know like on on some of these pieces here like this is really symbolic in my opinion because osiris was depicted you know by an eagle and uh this is set here the anteater guy but on the back of this you have the the all-seeing eye which is like the primordial dodd and then you have the two serpents that are angels down below here uh one of them is depicted with water here this is the generic symbol for water globally you'll find it in peru egypt all over the place and uh so i believe this is this is to depict anki the one sun and and enlil the other son of the primordial god the angels that supposedly came here in the annunaka story yeah that's that's just amazing so i think i think the eye and the pineal gland is just consciousness i mean it's you got that recorded yeah and then the ankh being the symbol of life so you've got the symbol of life you've got consciousness you've got dna you know all all things that are pretty common what's that this is the symbol of the pharaohs here it's the uh i forget the the specific name for it's the it's not the hook it's um yeah they're they're they're they're uh the flail and the yeah i'm drawing a blank but needless to say you know when like king tut's uh sarcophagus he's holding these two items crossed over his chest you'll see it in egypt a lot wow yeah i can't so that's what top top is the one with the dog head no that's anubis uh thoth has got the the head of the ibis is this here the ibis bird and then he looks like uh i'm just trying to think of i gotta got a thoth somewhere handy oh nowhere that giant skull my gosh yeah there he is yeah so i mean it's that's either a metaphor or real i don't know which way like you know if you've gotta if you've got an advanced civilization that can genetically engineer anything it wants into anything it wants who's to say there couldn't be a dog head or thoth or or you know yeah yeah i think i think shape shifting is something that's depicted on many many of these pieces and uh and i believe to say that they often embodied these these animal type um uh you know perspectives or whatnot if you go into greek um norse like you'll see that they all represent animals and and constellations you know with the planets and saturn mercury like this is common across many different cultures so there's definitely something to that yeah like like thoth is found in samaria greek and egypt and he's known as hermes tresemmergistis in greek but but he's known as thoth and isis are both in egypt and sumeria so i think that's really important you know yeah i just don't know what to make of it because you know i i can't imagine you know representing animals and images with animal heads and regular bodies and images i can't imagine what the purpose of that would be unless it was a real thing or it was intended to be some type of metaphor right so but i don't understand why it would just be a metaphor why wouldn't you just uh yeah i don't know no i i think it was absolutely that these these um you know in genesis it talks in in the book of in the epic of gilgum as she talks about the angels uh mating with our females right and and creating offspring and that that's in the first chapters of the bible you know um across so many different people believe this story that angels had sex with or so what what were those beings who who you know what what did they possess did they possess special powers were they the giants were they the glowing beings did they have uh you know reptilian and different animal type characteristics i mean who who knows you know if we're made in in his image i mean is all life made in his image and so if that's the case then uh you know maybe that's where where we have all these different animals you know i always wondered as a kid like why do we have so many breeds of dogs and stuff you know everything's so there's just so much of it and then another bit to that story could be are they still here you know is this the uap phenomenon and they're here and we're just we're primitive baboons even by any standard compared to their advanced civilization right so you remember that one video of the uap that they had going in and out of the water yeah with no with no disturbance to the water yeah like mach six right or whatever they clocked it out yeah let's go that video i felt was really important and i don't see it very often these days and um you know you see a lot of aquatic type beings like here he has a type of a mermaid tail holding a trident um and you see these aquatic type tails you see the fish head with the uh the the the tail as well um like they depict enki so it's very possible that these things are in the sea you know yeah so i have a hypothesis about that so you know if you live in a poor neighborhood and you make some money you move out of the poor neighborhood you don't stay in the morning but generally so why couldn't it be why couldn't it also be true from an advanced civilization scale if we're primitive baboons just shooting spears at each other why would you want to live around that you want to live away from the primitive idiots who are blowing themselves up with missiles every day right so if you're deep in the sea and again i don't know if it's true or not but if you're deep in the sea who's going to come bother you unless you can actually go in the sea to visit right so it's just like antarctica you know there's a lot of hypothesis that there's stuff going on down there the nazis were really interested in it uh you know the whole world war ii thing i keep going back to it in my mind because you know he was chasing around the ark of the covenant and all these these sacred things uh you know developing ufo looking ships and crazy technology what the heck did he know or or thought he knew and was working towards right yeah exactly or being deceased and and yeah man it's quite the story to think about for sure like the indian uh the the manyans right so i mean they were talking about that stuff for thousands of years even they were carving stuff in the mountain you know the the temples that are carved into mountains this this same idea of carving out of the stone you know goes back for thousands of years right so petra and yeah it's it's crazy yeah turkey i mean you know even when i see gobekli tepe to me that looks primitive and that's 12 000 years old compared to this stuff and you know the peru and and uh even uh you know the the one that's in near singapore that was in uh graham hancock's movie the non-madal or maybe i'm saying it wrong yes yes it could be up to 60 000 years old when they you know were doing the carbon dating deep into that thing so you know yeah yeah i i think there's definitely something to that and i mean time will tell yeah all right so good stuff so aliencarvings.com you're on tick tock you're on instagram uh anything we didn't cover that you want to put out there no i think we we definitely got a good cover cool all right i i want to say thanks and then your name but i you know i i know you want to stay anonymous so thanks alien i stay anonymous for now you know um they keep talking about this this congressional thing that's something we didn't talk about but uh i i you know i've got a two-year-old and a family and and this is a side thing for me i researched this purely out of hobby and passion so it's all independence and i'm not trying to to bark up the wrong tree or anything like that and so right now it seems like there's a quite the cover-up you know and if that's the case and this stuff really is real i want to proceed with caution until congress grants this immunity for people to be able to talk about this you know like there's a reason the people from area 51 and all these different programs are are silenced and um so until we can do it safely yeah i'll probably stay quiet makes sense i don't blame you i i have a you know a daughter too so i totally get it yeah so gotta stay safe you know it's absolutely you try to anyways i mean i i can't let it go though you know my gut tells me to push forward with it and uh so here we go we appreciate it so thanks aliencarvings.com and uh see you later all right ciao have a good day
