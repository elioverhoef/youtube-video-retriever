# Blood Test #6 in 2022: Diet Composition (Part I)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number six in 2022 we saw that my biological age using levine's test was 34.5 years which is 15.2 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai that gave me a predicted age of 33 years which is 16.7 years younger than my chronological so what's contributing to these data first let's take a look at supplements well if you're a regular watcher of this channel then the first one shouldn't be a surprise i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine for about half of my life and then i restarted vitamin d on october 1st so about the last three weeks before the test so i didn't take any vitamin d for the first six weeks as i was getting regular sun exposure and that's it no other supplements including gero protectors or xenolytics which then brings us to diet so we can see that this blood test was on october 24th but how does diet relate to that date so how am i tracking diet so the average daily dietary intake from the last blood test which was on august 22nd through the day before this blood test for blood test number six on october 23rd so that 63 day period corresponds to blood test number six in 2022. So let's go through that approach for people who may not be familiar so here we're looking at the calendar august september and october and as i mentioned blood test number five was on august 22nd whereas october 24th was blood test number six and then we see those 63 days in between tests now every day since april of 2015 i've weighed all of my food prior to intake and then i enter those food amounts into an online tracking app known as chronometer and if you're interested in a discount link that'll be in the video's description i then enter daily chronometer data into a spreadsheet and the average intake for those 63 days including individual food amounts macro and micronutrients corresponds to blood test number six so each blood test since 2015 has a corresponding diet composition which then allows me to calculate correlations and based on that data i alter my dietary intake to optimize blood biomarkers so let's start off by taking a look at individual food amounts that corresponded to blood test number six in 2022 and that's what we can see here so ranked in order in terms of amount in grams from the highest intake down to the lowest this is the first half of the diet that corresponded to blood test number six including the first 25 foods so in in terms of why are the top seven foods here i covered that in test number four and if you're interested in that video it'll be in the right corner what i'd like to focus on in this video is what's different for test number six when compared with test number five there were a whole bunch of little experiments that i tried so let's go through each one of those so first i switch back to strawberries whereas for the last test i was mostly using a three berry mix of strawberries blackberries and blueberries so correspondingly we can see that my strawberry intake increased from 289 grams per day to 547 grams per day and also we can see that blackberries and blueberries decrease from 144 grams per day each down to about 32 grams per day so there were two main reasons why i prefer to go with strawberries over the combination of blackberries and blueberries first is that strawberries have a relatively lower fructose content per 100 calories where compared with the same amount of calories 100 calories from black blackberries and blueberries so strawberries have 6.8 grams whereas the combination of blackberries and blueberries they get 100 calories has 8.3 grams and that's important because in my data a relatively higher fructose intake is significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i try to limit as much as possible overall fructose intake and the other reason for focusing on strawberries is that they have a net correlative score with big picture biomarkers that i've covered in other videos of positive four in other words a relatively higher strawberry intake is significantly correlated with lower levels of the liver enzyme ast lower levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein lower ldl and lower platelets and those are each going in the right direction in terms of aging or all-cause mortality risk so i i've given that i've made them green if it was red they'd be going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or all cause mortality risk my average strawberry intake since i started tracking food intake is 356 grams per day and in terms of the rules in terms of following these correlations that suggests that i should eat above my average intake because a positive score positive correlative score i would try to eat above my average intake so with that 547 is higher than 356 so i give it a check because i'm following that correlation now with the goal of optimizing as many blood biomarkers as possible i think it makes the most sense to follow also as many correlations as possible i don't know which food or macro and micronutrients will impact the given biomarker but if i follow the data if i follow the correlations as much as i can i'd expect for the best biomarker profile to result and that may be one reason underlying my relatively youthful biological ages using levine's test and aging.ai all right now where strawberries have a net positive correlative score with big picture biomarkers conversely blackberries and blueberries each have negative correlative scores of minus two and minus three respectively and with average intakes of more than 100 111 grams per day each that suggests the net negative correlative score suggests that i should eat below that and i did 32 is less than more than 111 so i get green checks because i'm following those correlations now next i also uh made a small but significant reduction for red bell pepper intake 233 to 227 grams per day uh now red bell peppers have a net correlative score with big picture biomarkers of negative four although they are significantly correlated with higher levels of albumin as shown in green there are also significant significantly correlated with high levels of ast creatinine neutrophils plate and platelets which are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk and they're also significantly correlated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes my average red bell pepper intake since i started tracking food intake in 2018 i started tracking macros and microbes in 2015. Unfortunately i didn't have the idea to track food going all the way back to 2015 and i wish i did nonetheless my red bell pepper average intake since i started tracking food intake is 293 grams per day and because 227 is less than that which is what we'd want to do with a net negative correlative score we give that a green check now note that red bell peppers have a net negative correlative score and a criticism that i've i've gotten a few times is why not just take them out for the net negatives just take them out maybe it's completely bad well red bell peppers are one of the few foods that are a concentrated source of the carotenoid beta-cryptosanthin and that's important because relatively higher blood levels of betacryptazanthin are significantly correlated with a younger epigenetic age which is what we can see here so here we've got blood levels of betacryptosanthin the epigenetic clock in this case is grimage dna m dna methylation so it's grimage epigenetic clock which is one of the best epigenetic clocks for its association with all-cause mortality risk and we can see that the relatively higher blood levels of beta-cryptosanthin were significantly correlated with a younger grimage as shown by the bicore and the p-value all right so moving along i also reduced barley intake from about 59 grams per day for test number five to 40 grams per day for test number six barley has a net positive score in my data of plus three it's significantly correlated with higher homocysteine and triglycerides which you can see i have red there those are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or all cause mortality risk but then it's got five biomarkers that it's inversely correlated significantly inversely correlated with in green and when i say significantly note that that's a p-value less than 0.05 so uh barley intake since i started tracking food intake in 2018 my average is 14 grams per day with a net positive correlative score that suggests i should eat more than my average and because 40 is higher than 14 we give it a green check now although for this test i want it by cutting the barley from 59 to 40 grams i wanted to address the question although its correlative score is positive how high is too high in other words above 14 grams per day what's the upper barley limit to simultaneously optimize each of these seven biomarkers and i should say that when considering its positive significant correlation with homocysteine and triglycerides both of those came down a bit for this test when compared with the last test whereas the other biomarkers in green didn't change much at all so based on these data it's possible that somewhere around 40 grams within the context of everything else in my diet of course may be optimal for me relative to a relatively higher barley intake of 59 grams per day all right so that's the first half of the diet let's take a look at what was different for test to test from from tested test for the other half and here's the other half using the same approach ranked in order from highest intake in grams uh to lowest intake uh in grams two so we've got all 50 foods that i ate or over the 63 day period and i should say there are two exceptions to the uh listening listing in grams green tea i listed in ounces uh and pizza i listed in calories number ranked at number 31. But we'll get more into that in a bit all right so the first thing that we can see that i changed from test to test five to six was flaxseed intake increased it from about 12 grams to about 16 grams per day flax seeds in my data have a net correlative score of plus four they're significantly correlated with lower neutrophils creatinine uh hdl ldl and platelets sorry and also red blood cells and you can see that five of those are going in the right direction in terms of aging and or all cause mortalities whereas that correlation for hdl is going in the wrong direction so lower hdl will be worse my average flaxseed intake since 2018 is 9.7 grams per day so with a net positive correlative score i would try to eat above my average intake and because 16 is higher than 9.7 we give that a green check now note that for test number five i was at 11.8 grams per day which is which was already higher than my average intake which is following the correlations so why did i further increase flax seeds for this test now one of the biomarkers that flax seeds are significantly correlated with is creatinine and for from from test 5 to test six i was able to reduce creatinine from 1.04 to 0.98 milligrams per deciliter now i'd like to have creatinine levels that are even lower somewhere around 0.9 milligrams per deciliter which is the low end of my range since uh 2015. Since i started tracking blood doing blood testing so often now my average creatinine level since 2015 is 0.95 so uh 0.98 isn't much different from 0.95 but i'd like to further improve that down to 0.9 or so if correlation equals causation and if flaxseed somehow impact creatinine i thought it made sense where if i further increase flax seeds i should see further reductions for creatinine and so far so good i'm going to actually try to go a little bit higher and try to find that upper limit again if correlation equals causation in terms of creatinine four flax seeds all right next up on the list are peanuts so i increase them from none none zero grams per day up to 12 grams per day and the major reason is because peanuts are a good source of niacin and one of the goals was to keep niacin relatively high so more than 40 milligrams per day and we'll go into that in another video and that was to make up for the niacin reduction by cutting barley so barley's also a good source of niacin so by cutting barley i cut niacin but by including peanuts i was able to keep nice and relatively high now peanuts have a net score of zero it's not significantly correlated with uh it's significantly correlated with an equal amount of biomarkers going in the wrong and right direction which gives it a net score of zero we'd suggest that i should eat my average intake which is 2.6 grams per day since 2018. So we can see that 12.3 is higher than 2.6 so i give that an x so i'm not following that correlation all right so next up are pistachios so i went from 11 grams per day down to 9.9 and that's a significant difference the two groups 63 days for this period versus however many days were that corresponded to test number five now one reason i did that is because uh and one gram a day may not seem like much but let's take a look at why i did that so pistachios are a great source of melatonin and i'll put that link the link for that paper in the video subscription so in a few days i purposely didn't eat them to limit the morning sleepiness that can come with too much melatonin now whether that was related to just some mild sleep that that had nothing to do with pistachios or indeed from too much melatonin coming from eating pistachios on too many consecutive days i don't know but that was one of the reasons that i cut their intake now in terms of their correlations they have a net correlative score of plus four and you can see the biomarkers there so based on my average intake of 2.1 grams that suggests with a positive correlated score i should eat above my average intake because 9.9 is higher than 2.1 we give that a check all right next up are eggs so i increased it from zero grams per day up to seven and the main reason for that is be to do the dietary cholesterol dhea sulfate experiment and if you missed that that video will be in the right corner i also increased brazil nut intake from 3.4 grams per day up to 4.7 now brazil nuts are a rich source of selenium selenium is required for conversion of the thyroid hormone t4 into its active form t3 so uh did the ratio t3 to t4 improve because selenium is there and selenium you know may improve the conversion of t4 to t3 so i have two data points so this is very preliminary data for the t3 to t4 ratio and i should mention that a relatively higher ratio is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk so a higher t3 to t4 ratio would be better in terms of risk of death for all causes so i have a fingerprint test that i did on october 3rd so that ratio was 1.64 and the average selenium intake my average selenium intake for the seven days prior to that test was 186 micrograms per day now i then tested by venipuncture on october 18th so about two weeks later and my t3 to t4 ratio was then 2.92 which is higher now i can't obviously evaluate statistical significance for those two ratios 1.64 versus 2.92 but the 272 micrograms per day for selenium for the seven days prior to that test is significantly higher versus the first test so whether it was selenium or some other factor that i ended up having a higher t3 t4 ratio including maybe it's a difference for venipuncture versus fingerprick i don't know but the ratio t3 t4 definitely went in the right direction uh as my selenium intake also went up and again i don't know if that's causation it could be lots of different things so brazil nuts in terms of the correlations they have a net correlative score and my data of minus two with uh four biomarkers going in the wrong direction in red and two going in the right direction in green my average brazil nut intake since i started tracking food intake is 5 grams per day so when the court net correlative score is negative that suggests i should eat below my average intake 4.7 is less than 5 so we give that a green check i also increased my ginger intake and this is fresh ginger not powdered from 0.6 grams per day up to 1.9 and the major reason there is because ginger has a very positive net correlative score of plus seven in my data with seven biomarkers going in the right direction in terms of aging and awe and or all cause mortality risk my average ginger intake since i started tracking food intake is 0.65 grams per day and because 1.9 is higher than that we give that a check following the correlation all right and then last for these foods i increase clove intake and that may not seem like a big difference 0.1 versus zero but the data showed it two sample t two sample t-test as significantly different at least nominally significant significantly different i can also already hear people yelling at me about it just p values but that's another story anyway the main reason why i increased my clove intake through diet is because although it's already in my homemade mouthwash with the goal of trying to optimize the oral microbiome and i'll put that video in the right corner too i think that adding ground clothes into the diet may also be a good idea and as the corollary for why i think that may be a good idea just like a dietary nitrate the direct effect will be an increase in oral nitrate in the mouth from the food but also absorbing it through the blood and then secrete it back into a to the into the mouth by the salivary glands i think a similar possibility uh is is is possible i think it's also possible for by eating cloves i may get some of the beneficial uh it's beneficial metabolites that can impact the salivary microbiome to be absorbed into my salivary glands through the blood and then secreted into the mouth potentially optimizing my oral microbiome now that's the hypothesis we'll see if that's true when i retest uh for test number three for the salivary microbiome which i haven't done yet so for cloves they have a net quarter score of plus one my average clove intake since 2018 is 0.13 grams per day so since that's identical to what my average was for this test and because the correlative score was positive that suggests i should go higher so we give that an x now i've i've been eating clothes more regularly since this test on october 24th so i'll be following this correlation for test number seven in 2022. All right so what about junk i haven't gone through that yet my diet isn't always clean uh so i do occasionally add junk and if i do i try to stick to the day of immediately after the blood test and the day after uh for this period it was actually three days so i had junk on three of the 63 days that corresponded to this test and no junk on 60 days and for the junk i had two slices of pizza it was nothing special domino's and actually regretted eating it after the fact uh anyway so i'll probably get some higher quality pizza in a couple months when i travel on the east coast to see my parents and then uh other junk was nutella which was on the day of and the day after the test and i had to put 145 grams there because people have commented before where they thought that i was eating literally 2.3 grams of nutella every day but that's not the case i had nutella on two of the days that corresponded to the 63 for this test and then nothing after that and then last in terms of junk with swedish fish which is a type of candy i had that just on one day 60 grams not one gram every day for for 63 days that would be ridiculous all right so that's the first part of my diet analysis that corresponds to blood test number six in 2022 in part two of this series we'll look at the macronutrient and micronutrient profile that corresponded to test number six if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack agent you can check us out on patreon and before you go we've got some discount links that you may be interested in including epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking with chronometer or if you would just like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all these links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
