# 13y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #6 in 2024; Test #54 Since 2015)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic function can aging and disease risk be slowed so apologies if you've heard that a trillion times that's the main focus of the channel and with that in mind earlier in september september 6 2024 i blood tested for the sixth time in 2024 and note that this is test number 54 since august of 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age and we'll see that using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag and if you have blood test data and want to calculate your own biological age using this metric there'll be a downloadable excel file in a link from my website in the video's description no email required all right so when entering these data i get a biological age of 38.6 years which is 13 years younger than my chronological but note that this is just one test and it's important not to get too high or too low for one test it's important to look at year-to-year changes so with that in mind let's see more context and look at all biological age results using this test since 2018 which is what we'll see here so when i first started testing in 2018 to 2019 i only had three tests and with an average pheno age or an average biological age of 36.1 years so then thinking that three tests over a 2-year span is not enough to evaluate year toe changes i started testing more often testing six times each in 2020 and 2021 and in both of those years average fenal wage was 35.6 years so that's probably a closer approximation of the full year average as six tests is better than looking at three tests over a 2-year period in 2022 i tested seven times with my best data yet an average of 33.8 years the data got a bit worse in 2023 7 tests 34.7 years and after the first six tests including the most recent test average fenal ag in 2024 is very close to where it was in 2023 34.6 years now just as an interesting aside note that this test on september 6th looks like an outlier relative to all the other tests in 2024 and at about the same time in 2023 also an outlier now i don't know if these are seasonal effects or there's something going on in my environment in late august early september but i'm eager to find out so i'll check out the correlations and see what i can come up with so that i can avoid this fate around the same time next year in 2025 so what we can see from this six years plus of data is that i've avoided an age related biological age increase so biological age increases for every year of chronological age so i've resisted that for at least this six-year period now another way to look at the data is by subtracting biological age from chronological age and when doing that in 2018 to 2019 chronological age minus biological age was 9 to 9 to 10 years younger which i was able to improve 2020 to 2021 11 to 12 years younger my best or close to my best data yet in 2022 15 years younger and that's the average of 15 years younger looking at all of the tests for a given year and then when considering 2023 and 2024 data i've been able to maintain so far in the 15 to 16 years younger range chronological age minus biological age so within this context we can see that the september 6 test years younger is actually worse than average not just by looking at it as an outlier but relative use uh when using that chronological age minus biological age average for the full year 13 years is worse compared to that so i've got to get back to the 15 to 16 years or better going forward for the last two tests in 2024 at least that's the plan all right so rather than looking at data entered into a spreadsheet let's take a look at the full blood test report uh from the lab and that's what we'll see here so to generate these data note that i don't go to my physician which in the past has generally involved me essentially begging them to measure the things i want to measure so in my case now i'm able to go to tabs.com and there'll be an affiliate link in the video's description alal laabs uses quest diagnostics so i go to alal laabs their website i pick the test i want to want to measure on for that given test i bring the lab form to quest diagnostics and then pay the i think it's like a $10 lab draw fee and then i get the results pretty quickly thereafter so for this test i measured in the morning on a friday around 7:30 in the morning and got the results by around 6:00 6:20 the next day so pretty fast turnover so if you want to help support the channel while also testing yourself again there's an affiliate link in the video's description so let's highlight some uh highlights and some potential weak spots for room for improvement in the blood test report and i think that's important because i don't want to just focus on pheno wage which have may have blind spots i want to focus on as many biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible so let's start off with hdl which i've covered many times in many videos and hdl is currently a strength but it wasn't always like that so for the 11th test in a row hdl is now in the optimal range for men which is 50 to 60 milligrams per deciliter and if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner so over those 11 tests average hdl is 54.5 milligram per deciliter in contrast for the 43 tests prior to the past 11 test average hdl was about 45 milligram per deiler so for those who struggle with raising hdl my data shows that it can be increased and consistently maintained at that higher level for at least this 11 test period all right also we can see hscrp so for whatever reason quest diagnostics has lowered their detection limit it used to be less than3 mig per liter now it's less than2 mg per liter and as we can see for this test it was at that detection limit again less than2 mg per liter now that's important because because for the n 19th consecutive test hscrp is below the detection limit so it's somewhere below. 3 milligrams per liter another uh strong strong spot another uh highlight is glucose at 87 so what's optimal for glucose is what's found in youth and what's associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk which is 80 to 94 milligrams per deciliter and let's take a look at that story because i haven't posted in a while on the channel so for those who may not be familiar let's r the data for blood levels of glucose so glucose increases during aging which is what we'll see here and this is in a study of 12.5 million people so i always aim for the largest studies that i can find for a given biomarker as that would be expected to be closer to the truth in terms of population based averages so if anyone that's watching comes across a larger study than any of the video any that i post in the video please post it in the comments i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video so for glucose uh average glucose levels in so 18year olds is around 85 mg per decil for both men and women which then increase to greater than 100 mig per decil in 88 year olds now age expected based on my current chronological age of 51.6 years almost 52 in a few months is 99 milligrams per per deciliter that's the average based on my chronological age based on this plot but for the first six tests in 2024 average glucose levels are 89.9 so 9 mg per deciliter which is the average value for someone that's about 20 years younger chronologically so the glucose data is one reason why feno agage is consistently younger at least in my case all right what about all cause mortality risk so from the same study and note that all the studies in the video will be in the video's description so if you want to check it out yourself it'll be in the video's description 80 to 94 in this same study is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here so on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio so risk of death all causes plotted against fasting levels of glucose fasting circulating levels of glucose and in terms of lowest risk we can see that green bar is in the 80 to 94 milligram per deciliter range and then when glucose levels are less than 80 or higher than 94 we see a significantly increased all cause mortality risk all right so back to the blood test data now it's time to highlight a weak spot which triglycerides at maybe not crazy high at 75 but this is a weak spot at least based on my interpretation of the data and we can see why because lowest coronary heart disease chd mortality risk is associated with triglycerides being less than 45 mgrs per deciliter and that's what we'll see here this is a study of 4.5 million people and the data that i'm presenting is for 18 to 45 year olds the data up to 64 year olds which is a separate separate plot so 46 to 64 year olds in this study is similar this that's why i didn't show it but the data for triglycerides gets a bit different for people that are older than 65 nonetheless i try to focus on what youthful data looks like so that's why i'm highlighting the 18 to 45 year age range so on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio for chd mortality risk so risk of death from coronary heart disease plotted against circulating levels of triglyceride and we or triglycerides and we can see that when triglycerides are higher than about 45 mig per deciliter all cause mortality risk starts to increase now if we only focus on the reference range which lists less than 150 as quote unquote optimal or that's just their reference range right it doesn't necessarily imply optimal that's just what they suggest that we should be at we can see that using that as the cut off there's a 30% higher coronary heart disease mortality risk relative to using less than 45 as the cut off and when considering my current data of 75 mig per decil of this te for this test that would be associated with about a 15% increased risk of death from heart disease mortality risk relative to having less than 45 so the goal is to in in my case the goal is to reduce triglycerides to less than 45 at least going forward all right so on to page two of the blood test report which is what we can see here so uric acid got flagged by the lab at 3.7 milligram per deciliter as being low which then raises the question what's optimal for uric acid so uric acid increases during aging which is what we'll see here with circulating levels of uric acid on the y- axis plat against age from 20 to 80 years on the x-axis so on the top plot in blue we've got data from men and in red we've got data for women so starting with the data for men in youth average uric acid levels in 20-year olds are 310 micromolar or 5.2 mg per deciliter and then afterwards there's a pretty slow but continuous increase for uric acid levels during aging at least for men for women the story is a bit different they start off with an average level of uric acid that's lower in 20y old s which either decline or are basically flat until around 40 and then we can see a pretty close to linear and steep increase for uric acid levels in women up to 80 years all right what about all cause mortality risk so the values that are found in youth around 5 micromolar uh 5 milligrams per deciliter sorry or 300 micromolar are also associated with lowest risk of death for all causes all cause mortality risk acm risk which is what we'll see here so on the y- ais we've got the hazard ratio for all cos mortality so risk of death for all causes plotted against circulating levels of uric acid and in terms of lowest risk we can see that it's right there that you know that mids spot of that j-shaped curve at about 5 milligrams per deciliter so to put my most recent data into context that 3.7 mig per deciliter it will be somewhere there still pretty close to lowest risk but it shows that i do have some room to increase it if i choose now the reason i the reason i raised that issue is because for the test before this you're acid was a bit higher at 4.7 mig per deciliter and in conjunction with that test i had my best horvath epigenetic age and uh dna methylation based estimation of tmr length and to get there one part of that story may be a higher protein intake and higher sardines which may have increased uric acid so that's the the long story short there is i have some room to increase uric acid if i want to and i may do that by increasing sardines with the goal of potentially keeping my epigenetic age metrics uh relatively youthful so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video all right so back to the blood test report and then we can see based on the what's found in youth and all cause mortality risk that there's no reason to worry about that 3.7 uh flag from the lab for uric acid all right so another new uh test that i've added is ggt gamma glutamil transferase which is a liver specific enzyme relatively lower is better i'll probably give ggt its own video as it may be an important biomarker for a different bio ological age tool not feno age so stay tuned for that video too in an upcoming video all right weak spots mcv so the mcv for this test was 94.7 which is my highest value over 51 tests since 2015 all right so that then raises the question what's optimal for the mcv so the mcv increases during aging so on the y-axis we've got the mcv plotted against age this is from 26 to 90y olds in youth in this case 26 year olds we can see that average aage mcv values in men were around 90 which then increased to around 94 an average value of 94 in people that were close to 90 years old so to put my most recent data into perspective 94.7 for mcv that would be age expected for someone around or older than 90 years so this is not great data what about all cause mortality risk so that's what we'll see here and this is a relatively small study but this is the largest study that i was able to find for the association with mcv which stands for the mean corpuscular volume so that's the average volume of a red blood cell do you have very large uh red blood cells or do you have very small red blood cells so a a relatively large mcv would be that i have very large uh red blood cells and smaller would be better at least in terms of what's found in youth so what about all cause mortality risk so again this is a relatively small study anyone that's come across a larger study than 36,000 or so please post it in the comments i'd be happy happy to give you a shout out so the second core in this study was defined as the reference so 90.5 to 93 for the mcv and then the first quartile and the third quartile were not significant associated with an increased or decreased all cause mortality risk relative to the second quartile but when the mcv became larger than 95.8 that was associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so to see that we look at the 95% confidence interval that's the data that i just boxed or rectangled in blue and so so for the first quartile the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one so that range 83 to 1.34 overlaps with one so that's not significantly different from the reference but when looking at the fourth quartile we can see that 1.15 to 1.8 is completely above a hazard ratio of one so that's a significant increase in terms of the association for mcv with all cause mortality risk so from the all cause mortality data we can see that the mcv less than 95.8 is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk so to put my mcv of 94.7 into context it would be what you would expect to find in someone who's of an older chronological age and it's not too far away from the highest all cause mortality risk now this is just one test and the goal again is to look at year-to-year averages fortunately my year-to-year average for the mcv is not 94.7 but the data went in the wrong direction and now i've got to figure out what i can do to bring it back down closer to 90 or lower if i can and the first part of that story is by looking at diet composition and supplements in terms of how they corresponded to this most recent test that was 13 years younger biologically and as a part of that story i look at correlations i follow the correlations with the goal of optimizing biomarkers including reducing mcv reducing triglycerides so stay tuned for those
