If we track and optimize biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging be slowed now most health and anti-aging approaches only focus on metabolic markers including glucose and the lipid panel in contrast big picture biomarkers that i commonly show on this channel include the metabolic markers but also include markers of immune liver kidney function and others as shown here so the immune category would include white blood cells or leukocytes erythrocytes red blood cells thrombocytes platelets c-reactive protein each of those are included in the big picture biomarkers also included are markers related to liver health and function including the transferase enzymes more specifically ast albumin and not included on the on this list for this paper is alkaline phosphatase which is in the big big picture biomarker list and i also include markers related to kidney function including creatinine blood urine nitrogen and uric acid now leanness and fitness is a big part of my approach which would cover the muscular most of the musculoskeletal category and in terms of cardiovascular markers i commonly or i measure every day resting heart rate and heart rate variability rhr and hrv so the goal if uh is to cover as many systems as possible and the hypothesis is that by tracking and attempting to optimize as many systems as possible we may be able to delay aging and potentially extend lifespan so what about markers related to lung function blood pressure bp and brain interestingly there it may be possible to improve lung function which will reduce blood pressure and that may be a means to slow brain aging so let's get into it so first lung function defined as the fev1 declines during aging so the first question then is what is the forced expiratory volume in one second or fev1 and that's how much air can be forcefully expired in one second and it declines during eight aging as shown here so we're looking at the fe fev1 on the y-axis plotted against age and in this case we've got people younger than 20 and older than up to older than 80. So we can see that the fev-1 peaks uh around 20 years old and then steadily declines during aging this is data in men i covered the data for women in an earlier video if you missed that it'll be in the right corner so fev1 is also a top predictor of chronological age in this preprint and note that all of the papers in this video will be in the video's description so if you're interested in that check it out so in this study and this was a study that included about 400 000 people including both men and women as shown by the black arrows we can see that actually first by looking at the biomark biomarker contribution to the chronicle age prediction in other words how much did each biomarker contribute to the overall prediction of chronological age in men we can see that the fev1 was the third best predictor and in women it was the second best and note that in men the fev-1 was a better predictor or contributed more to the prediction of chronological age relative to other blood-based biomarkers including markers of kidney functions so sister and c and urea and other bio blood blood-based biomarkers including testosterone and igf-1 now before leaving this data note that the best predictor or the predictor that contributed most to the prediction of chronological age is systolic blood pressure and i'll have more on that in a minute so to improve fev1 or and or slow the age-related decline tracking is the first step and fev1 is measured with a spirometer and i've highlighted this one because it's been shown to be as good as spirometry performed at the physician's office so i was interested in getting a spirometer that could measure fev1 that's been peer-reviewed you know to be as good or similar to what's performed in a doctor's office and this model here has been shown indeed to do that so then the big question then is what's my fev1 so i've only been tracking it for about the past month i only have nine days of data so each of these red circles is an individual day of data so we've got the fev1 there on the y-axis plotted against each data point for about the last month and note that each data point also represents the highest value of nine attempts per day i didn't want to just measure this once because there could be potential variability in each measurement so by measuring it nine times and taking the highest value i should be able to minimize uh the test the test variability by using the spirometer so when we take the average of these nine measurements over about the past three weeks uh three weeks the month we can see that my average fev1 is 3.27 liters per second so how does that compare with the expected fev1 based on chronological age so for that we go back to the plot on the left and we can see that my expected fev1 based on my chronological age would be 3.7 liters per second however my data is to the right of that which would be 11 to 12 years older than expected based on chronological age so not good if there's a weakness in my data this is potentially also a weak weakness in my data in addition to dhea sulfate at the moment and note that it's far from youthful values which would be somewhere around 4.5 liters per second so now note that i don't know what my fev-1 was in youth so i can't say if or and how much it's declined and then the next question is can it be improved i don't like having data that's older than expected based on my chronological age so i obviously want to make it better can it be improved and the good news is it can so this is a study uh looking at ins inspiratory muscle training or imt in long distance runners and there are many studies using imt or again inspiratory muscle training uh in unhealthy populations for example people that have lung disease so cop copd as an example but i wanted to focus on relatively healthy populations because that will be most relevant to me uh for now so what is the imt and in this case this isn't just deep breathing against no resistance this is deep breathing uh against a resistance and you can see a device is used for that that provides the resistance uh either on inhalation or exhalation so again on inhalation would be an imt trainer emt would be a trainer focused on exhalation muscle muscle training so this is pulmonary system strength training so in this study the average age and bmi is shown there so this is a relatively young cohort uh average age about 24 years and relatively lean with a normal bmi of 22 kilograms per meter squared this was an eight-week study they trained five days a week and they did 30 inspirations each each group did 30 inspirations per day and then there were three groups so when the and note that each of these three groups that one of the things they were looking at in terms of lung function was fev1 obviously to see if it improved as a result of training so in the first group they use the device called power breathe and uh they again this wasn't just deep breathing they trained against a resistance in this case the resistance was 50 to 70 percent of their maximal inspiratory pressure or mip and we can see for this group there was a significant increase of 7.7 percent for the fev1 after the eight at the end of the eight week study in the second group they used it also in imt an inspiratory muscle training device known as threshold ideally they should have used the same device power brief but they use a different one and they also used a different mip a different maximal inspiratory pressure of 30 to 50 percent and in this group there was no change when compared with baseline for the fev1 so from these two groups we can see that it's possible that imt training at greater than 50 of the maximal inspiratory pressure may be required for improving fev1 and a lot in the last group these were the controls there was no inspiratory muscle training no imt and we can see that they didn't change from baseline uh and after when compared with baseline the eight week data wasn't different from baseline so note that fev1 is a measure of expiratory muscle strength as you're you're quantifying the amount that you're able to expire the amount of air that you're able to expire in one second so why have i studied why have i decided to focus on a study that used inspiratory uh muscle strength training so note that there's a lot less data published data for expiratory muscle training when compared with imt and also inspiratory muscle training has been also shown to reduce blood pressure and we can see that data here so we've got the svp systolic blood pressure on the y-axis and then we we've got that plotted against age so two studies in young adults one study in middle aged slash older adults and then two studies in middle age slash older adults that had obstructive sleep apnea so for all six of these studies and before getting into the data note that the two circles black is baseline and the tan is post inspiratory muscle strength training or imst so for each of these six studies we can see that blood pressure systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced regardless if the starting blood pressure was relatively high or low so you can see that for the young group blood pressure systolic blood pressure was in the 110 to 120 range which is relatively low and they saw improvements and then there were also blood pressure improvements even for people who had values in the range of the 130 to 140 range so higher so so blood pressure was improved regardless if the starting blood pressure was relatively high or low and regardless if the groups were young or relatively older so from this we can see that inspiratory muscle strength training imst improved lung function as defined in this case as one measure of lung function the fev1 which also serves to reduce systolic blood pressure so how does that link with slowed brain aging so in this study optimal blood pressure keeps our brains younger they identified a relatively younger brain age which was assessed by mri and people that had blood pressure values that were less than 115 over 75. So then the question becomes could my blood pressure benefit from inspiratory or expiratory or combination of the two training so for that let's take a look at my blood pressure values over the last three years now compared to other data like uh resting heart rate heart rate variability we're at 1500 days of data i haven't tracked blood pressure as frequently as you can see i only have 55 data points over a three year period nonetheless when taking the average of these 55 days my average systolic blood pressure is a 123.2 milligrams of mercury so based on the brain age study that i just showed before with uh a reduced brain age for people that had uh 115 over 75 i've got some room for improvement with my 123 value so what's my expected to further illustrate this point what's my expected systolic blood pressure based on chronological age and we can see that here systolic blood pressure and this is over the about 20 to 95 year old age range so my expected systolic blood pressure based on chronological age would be 125 millimeters of mercury so we can see that i'm relatively close to what's expected from our chronological age and this is not youthful data which would be somewhere going in the other direction going to the left somewhere closer to 115. So i've got room for improvement with my systolic blood pressure all right what about diastolic blood pressure so over those same 55 data points over the past three years my average dbp is about 75 millimeters of mercury and we can see that that's good based on the brain age study as less than 75 for the diastolic blood pressure was associated with the young relatively younger brain age so then the big question is how will i reduce systolic blood pressure and as we saw earlier in the video inspiratory muscle training imst improve lung function and more specifically the fev1 and imst training has also been shown to reduce blood pressure and more specifically systolic blood pressure now with with this in mind i think it's possible to improve two organ systems and maybe even three brain age although i won't be able to do mri on my brain so i won't be able to know for sure but at least theoretically i should be able to improve brain age if systolic blood pressure has an impact on brain age by just using one technique so inspiratory muscle strength training but then i think the biggest bang for the buck will be by using a combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle trainer i don't think it makes sense to only train one group of muscles that are related to lung function i think it makes the most sense to train the inspiratory and the expiratory muscles so my next step is to buy combined device and i'm still sorting out which one is best but i should have a decision relatively soon all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including oral microbi oral microbiome composition epigenetic testing at home testing blood testing with quantify diet tracking with chronometer or if you're interested in just supporting the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and each of these links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
