Tiir length declines during aging in both men and women on the y- ais we've got ltl or lucy t length so tmar length in white blood cells and on the x-axis we've got age ploted from 20 to about 100 years old and here we can see the age related decline for t tiir length such that in youth t length is 7.75 kb or kilobases whereas in advanced age it's about five kilobases now the importance of the age related decline for tmia length is that shorter tiir are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk which is what we can see here on the y- axis we've got cumulative survival so all cause mortality risk or risk of death for all causes plotted against follow-up time and in this case it was 14 years after the initial assessment of tiir length and here we can see that people who had the longest tiir had a significantly reduced all cause mortality risk when compared with people who had the shortest tail length as shown in blue so that raises a few questions first first can tiir shortening be slow during aging second which factors may impact tiir length and third what's my data to illustrate or to attempt to address these questions so in terms of what's my data i sent blood to true diagnostic this discount link in the video's description if you want to measure your own tm length so the most recent data that i have is on july 5th of 2023 i also sent the sample in august but i'm waiting on those results so for the july test we can see that my tm length was 7.1 kilobases which i've got some room for improvement because in youth tm length is 7.75 kilobases but there is good news and that involves looking at how tiir length in 2023 compares with 2022 so year-over-year changes which is what we can see here on the y axis we've got tm length and then on the left we've got 2022 data versus 2023 data on the right in 2022 over three tests my average t length was 7.04 kilobases whereas in 2023 the average is 7 .14 kilobases and rather rather than just looking at groups or average data year-over-year we can address whether they are statistically different by using a two sample t test and when doing that we can see that 2023 data is indeed significantly better than 2022 as you can see the p value is less than 0.05 all right so which factors may impact ti length and to address that first let's take a look at calorie intake this is calorie intake over the first seven tests and that's what we can see here on the y xis we've got tm length and on the x we've got my average daily calorie intake now note that the average daily cal calorie intake since i track my food every day with the food scale that's from the previous test to the day before the most recent test in other words if there's 60 days in between blood test the average daily calorie intake then corresponds to that second test and for each test there is a corresponding diet composition so in terms of that correlation we can see that calorie intake is inversely associated with ti length over the these first seven tests in other words when my calorie intake is relatively higher my average daily calorie intake is relatively higher tm length is shorter and conversely a relatively lower calorie intake is significantly correlated with a longer tm length but calorie intake doesn't tell us much about di composition so what about that how how might that impact tmr length so to address that let's take a look at correlations for macro and micronutrients which is what we can see partially here these are macros and micros that have a p value less than 0.05 but note that for a p value less than 0.05 there were about 40 comparisons and that p value that means that there are potentially five false positive per 100 comparisons and because i looked at about 40 macros and micros we can expect that at least two on this list could be a false positive discovery so to address that i calculated the false discovery rate which is an extra layer of statistical rigor and we can see that now only four are significant based on the ke value less than 0.05 cut off and the fdr false discovery rate cut off of less than 0.05 and they are the omega 6 to omega-3 ratio omega3 copper and vitamin b1 but they're going in different directions so relatively higher omega-3 intake and vitamin b1 are significantly correlated with longer tiir in my case whereas the a higher omega 6 to3 rao and uh copper are sign are inversely correlated with t length in my data now in addition to looking at macros and micros i also looked at foods and that's what we can see here so again this is the list of foods that were nominally statistically significant so a p value less than 0.05 i looked at about 50 different foods in my diet and when considering again that five false positives per 100 comparisons we can expect that 2 to three based on a p value less than 0.05 could be false disc false positives so i calculated the fdr and after calculating the fdr only three remains statistically significant parmesan cheese cocoa beans or cacao and flax seed and more specifically a relatively higher intake of parmesan cheese and cacao beans are significantly correlated with a shorter t length whereas conversely flax seed is significantly correlated with a longer tm length but note that everything i've just shown you are unadjusted correlations are these correlations still significant after accounting for calorie intake especially when considering that calorie intake is significantly correlated with teal length so to address that i looked at multivariant models and that's what we can see here so at the top we've got the beta coefficient uh so are these are the correlations for calories and parmesan cheese positively or negatively associated with tm length and then the p value less than 0.05 being the measure of statistical significance so after including calories in this model we can see that parmesan cheese is still significantly correlated or significantly associated with t length so higher parmesan intake is significantly correlated with a shorter t t sorry t intake sorry a shorter t length after accounting for calorie intake and then i use that similar that same approach for both kab bein and flax seeds so after adjusting for calorie intake we can see that a relatively higher intake of cacao is still significant correlated or associated with a shorter tiir length and conversely after adjusting for calorie intake a relatively higher flax seed intake is significantly associated with a longer tm length i then used that approach for the macros and micros or the ones that were significally associated with tm length but none of those four that were significant omega3 the 6 to3 ratio b1 or copper none of those were significant after adjusting for tm length now rather than adding extra layers or in addition to adding extra layers of statistical rigor to try to identify what might be impacting tm length i can alter level levels of these foods and that to me would be the most direct approach so that's the plan to eat a a bit less parmesan to eat a bit less cacao and maybe a little bit more flax seeds and we'll see how tiir length looks for the next test test number six which is planned for october of 2023 all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for adome metabolomics any quantification epigenetic testing including teir testing or microbiome composition green tea add home blood testing with scci fox health note that their panel is different from the iolo panel so there's very minimal overlap die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
