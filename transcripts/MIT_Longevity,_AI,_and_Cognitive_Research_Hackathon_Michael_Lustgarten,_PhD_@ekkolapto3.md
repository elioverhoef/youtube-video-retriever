By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

All right so uh hey everyone uh my name is michael lgarden and uh today we're going to go through my datadriven personalized approach for optimal health and potentially longevity and this is a small snapshot of what i do uh i post uh weekly videos sometimes most of the time more than once a week uh so if you want more if you want to see more uh that's my that's my site conquering or d trying so risk of death increases as chronological age increases and that's what we'll see here so on the y axis we've got death rate plotted against age from birth until 95 years and you can see that death rates are very high for newborns after which mortality rates decline rapidly until we're about 10 to 14 years old and then you can see that uh mortality risk increases pretty close to linearly for every year that we're alive after that so the the big the big idea or the idea that i'm interested in is what if we could flatten mortality ris instead of seeing that linear increase over time what if we could flatten it and and keep it relatively low for as long as we physically can would could we optimize health and potentially lifespan in doing so so then the big question is how so aging and disease are a biochemical process that happen over many decades it's not something that just happens out of nowhere you don't just wake up one day in your age it's a biochemical process that's been happening for a very long time so if we track and optimize or attempt to optimize well established biomarkers of organ and systemic function can aging and disease risk be slowed so that's my central premise i say it almost in every video but but uh that's that's the root of the uh of the deal so then what should we track and i'm not going to go into everything here i'm just going to keep it tight i can go on on and on about what what what we should track but the the foundation of it is trying to track as many biomarkers biomarkers of as many organs and systemic function as possible and trying to keep it as youthful as possible so defining what youthful data looks like and uh you know data that's associated with reduced risk of death for all causes so keeping it in that space for as long as phys possible and then can we flatten mortality risk and optimize our life health and lifespan as a consequence of that so one example that uh potentially extends lifespan is young blood and so i should say that my f my my my goal isn't just focusing on optimizing blood biomarkers there's a hierarchy to this and at the top of that hierarchy is physical and cognitive function body composition so muscle mass uh visceral fat uh bone density these are things that change during aging uh and not for the better and then we can divide that into what's under the hood so blood biomarkers are one aspect of what's under the hood but then we can further subdivide that into cells protein metabolites epigenetics and i'm tracking levels i'm tracking portions of each of those stages so young blood so it extends lifespan in old mice how do we know that so in in this study prolonged heterochronic parab parabiosis decreased biological age and promoted longevity so then the obvious question should be what is heterochronic parabiosis so that's when two animals are surgically connected their blood streams are surgically connected so these animals basically share a blood supply for their duration of their lifespan and in this case old attached to young so what was the effect on lipan so on the y- axis we've got percent survival plotted against age in weeks and then in terms of median survival we look at 50% survival that's when half of the mice were alive and half had died and relative to two control groups the the old mice that had a blood supply that was surgically connected to a young mice for the duration of their lifespan had a significant extension in median lifespan so that shows that young blood has some factors in it that can extend the lifespan of old mice but it doesn't tell us which blood factors might be responsible so uh evidence for that comes from a different study and this is pretty recently uh published last month where fasting and the combination of f calorie restriction cr and fasting extended lifespan so there were five groups in the study ad lit they ate as much as they wanted and these are female mice and it's is a very large study was 960 mice in total 10 92 per group and then one day of fasting two days of fasting 20% cr 40% calor restriction in terms of lifespan we go to that 0.5% survival that's median survival and then for both fasting groups we see an increase in median survival uh c restriction 20% did better but then the best of the bunch was 40% cr so that that this shouldn't be a surprise this has been shown in other studies but what's interesting about this study is that many mice live past 36 months so the median lifespan and the uh 40% cr group group was 36 months but you can see that there were even mice in the ad li group who live past 36 months and other groups too not just the cr groups so the authors of this study asked what might contribute to a longer lifespan at least than mice independent of group assignment so that's what we can see here and i'm only going to focus on a couple of the biomarkers that are here i mean we can do a deep dive into all of them but the two that i'm focused on here is our lymphocytes which are a type of white blood cells so white blood cells are not a homogeneous group they're comprised of generally pro-inflammatory neutri h monocytes and lymphocytes which also are a part of you know the immune system so having relatively higher levels of lymphocytes when the mice were 16 months of age was significantly correlated with a longer longevity or with with longevity independent of which group group that the mice were in so uh it didn't matter if they were 20% cr or in ad li if they had higher levels of lydes 16 months they were more likely to have an extended longevity and live past 36 months on the other hand the rdw so the red blood cell distribution width which is a measure of uh the the variability in the size of your red blood cells so red blood cells who are young are very small and during aging they increase so the rdw is a measure of do you have lots of small red blood cells or do you have a mix of small and large which is more variable relative to having all small red blood cells so having a higher rdw was significant correlated with a short shorter uh shorter lightspan and again that's independent of which group so even even mice that were 40% cr if they had a higher rdw they' live shorter relative to other 40% cr mice that have a lower rdw now where this story gets interesting is that uh this is also these this pattern is also found in in humans it's not just in long live uh mice so the rdw increases during aging and that's what we'll see here so rdw on the yaxis plotted against age and we can see that age related increase and the importance of the rdw uh increase during aging in people is that relatively higher levels are associated with an increased risk of death for all causes so as i mentioned the at the beginning this is uh you know my data driven personalized approach for optimizing health and potentially lifespan so what's my data so i've been tracking not just the rdw but the standard chemistry panel and cbc which is about 25 to 30 biomarkers that represent many different organ systems uh metabolic health uh inflammation etc so i've tracked for the past 10 years as you can see i've got 51 blood tests which is an average of five per year but i've since bumped it up to eight and i'll probably continue doing eight blood tests a year uh for going forward indefinitely so in terms of rdw versus chronological age that's what we've got here and then we can see that there's a significant inverse correlation for the rdw with my chronological age so in other words i've resisted or reversed the age related rdw increase so in the longevity space there's a lot of hype and there's a lot of overe exaggeration and this is i guess kind of the point where i could say hey i've reversed this aspect of aging and superlatives right but that i i don't see it like that at all this is just one biomarker and the fact is i can't control what happened for for the first 40 years what i have done is though potentially slowed mechanisms that may be related to a shorter shorter lifespan and potentially worse health with a higher rdw in association with higher rdw all i can do for now though is try to maintain that at relatively low levels indefinitely and if i can do that going back to the central premise can i flatten my mortality risk using the same approach not just for the rdw but for all biomarkers all right so that was one biomarker what about lymphocytes as we saw that they are significantly correlated with a lifespan at least in the mice so here too the data is similar in people and in the long li mice so lymphocytes decline during aging with lymphocytes on the y axis plotted against age and then we can see that age related decline so it at youth in youth average values around 2,000 are more likely to be found and that's important because the age related decline for lympocytes is associated with an increased risk of death for all causes so which then brings us to what's my data again over those 51 tests so now we're at limites plotted against age and unfortunately we can see an age related decline so you know i can't you know i could easily show one biomarker and say hey i'm i'm kicking ass everywhere but the fact is this data shows that i've succumbed to some age related decline whereas i prefer for it to be flatline over time right to try to keep that mortality risk potentially flatlined for the for the duration of my my lifespan so then the big question is can i get it to to to you know to on that flatline level and then the big question is then what's the approach how can i get it back there how can i reverse or try to reverse this age related change so in terms of the approach i've weighed all my food and uh it just doesn't apply to food this applies to fitness metric sleep uh days i've worked out i mean i'm tracking basically everything but i'm only going to focus on food for now so weighed everything with the food scale since 2015 entered that into chronometer which is a diet tracking app and then i take that data and i put it in a spreadsheet so i've got macros micros individual foods so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake so if there's 50 days in between blood tests because i'm tracking everything in diet i can take the average dietary intake over that period and line it up with the latter blood test so now every blood test has a has a bunch of dietary and other biomarkers that i can run correlations on and i can see how much fat how much protein how much you know fiber micronutrients supplements what may be optimal for optimizing my biomarkers towards the mo most youthful values that they can possibly be so then i calculate those correlations i try to follow as many as possible which then brings us back to what can i do to potentially increase those lymphocytes so i don't have time to go through all of the you know the factors that are associated with higher correlated with higher lymphocytes but one factor in my data is calorie intake which is what we can see here the lympocytes plotted against the average daily cal calorie intake over those 51 tests so each dot corresponds to the average dietary uh calorie intake from test the test and then we can see that significant correlation so that suggests that in order to flatline uh the lymphocytes at relatively youthful levels and resist that age related change that i should potentially increase my calories somewhere up to around 2800 based on extrapolation of that trend line however more recently i'm around 2100 and that's on purpose because calor restriction may improve more my biomarkers relative to others so then that raises the question so what calorie intake might be best for lyos sites knowing that my most recent data i had three that were pretty bad and are probably pulling the correlation down making it making my lymphocytes look more aged and following that age related trajectory but it if what calorie intake may be best for the lymphocytes without messing up other biomarkers and that's important to say because it's easy for me to just focus on one or two or three biomarkers but my goal is to optimize everything across the board it's not just one organ system or one aspect of health it's do an intervention and what does it look like across the board and then is the net effect actually positive for the sum of those biomarkers neutral or detrimental and then of course correct based on that so a higher calorie intake in my case which is one argument against going too high for calorie intake with increasing lymphocytes is significantly correlated with a lot more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so as i mentioned i tracked that panel of about 25 to 30 biomarkers on the standard chemistry panel in cbc and this is just these are just the ones the little r is the correlation coefficient and then the p value is the correlation for calorie intake with each of these b markers so almost half of those those 25 biomarkers of organ and systemic function are significally correlated with these biomarkers going in the wrong direction in terms of how they look in in the youthful state versus aged and their and their associations with all cause mortality so just to highlight a couple rdw and this case you can see the correlation is positive so in my case a higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a higher rdw and that may be one factor how i've been able to reduce that rdw to now youthful levels so if i increase calories i may improve my lipocytes but on the other hand make my rdw worse so it's about finding the bottom of that u-shaped curve so that i can you know minimize risk and then you know we can see one other on the list because nick's in the crowd we can see that ldl in my case higher calories are significant correlated with higher ldl which i've got going in the wrong direction for now but i'm open to the idea that a little bit higher than where i am may be actually uh good for health so but that's a story for another day so to answer the question what calorie intake may be best for limpos sites it these data collective would suggest that not 2080 which is my lowest that corresponds to a blood test over the past 10 years but for now i'm at about 2150 and that's intentionally done and one reason for that is two blood tests ago lymphocytes were close to 1900 and i blood tested on friday it was also close to 1900 so i may be slowing that age related decline and getting my data back to where youthful values are supposed to be so that's what i got that's all i got for now uh more on the channel check it out if you're interestly great mike we'll do two quick questions if anybody has any david uh it's great to hear you talk in person mike us to for those who don't know he has a youtube channel and i think it's i just want to commend individuals who are interested in taking step concrete steps to improve their health and uh so it's a question of data how do we optimize the use of data which is really tr tricky at n equals one level so to my question and i'm keeping it broad because i kind of have an answer but i'm having you steer in terms of the answer um can you comment about your use of uh a pearsons or other correlation coefficient versus multiple aggression the role for potential confounding and may you help can educate the audience of that yeah it's a great point so uh for the most part i focus on i mean you could even talk about like uh false discovery array right so i mean yeah so and with when you have just a p value of less than 0.05 you're going to have five false positive correlations out of 100 right so i i even though i published using fdr in very lge large sample sizes i'm trying not to throw away any data i'm looking for gross patterns in the data and rather than you know exclude something something statistically i can directly test the correlation so for example if cocoa beans are associated with lower like prer a if i increase cocoa beans and my lipo doesn't changed and it had nothing to do with it right the correlation will weaken over time and then i'll see other stuff pop up in the correlation list and i'll continue to follow that eventually it's a matter of data collection it's how many how many tests do i have to do where now the story becomes evident and it looks like the real you know that's the real story so um so so yeah that's part of it the other aspect of it too is you know adjusting the models for you know some of this may be driven by body weight and calorie intake so if i'm looking at individual uh associations between say i don't know fat intake with a panel of biomarkers if it's if it's a significant in un adjusted you know just a straight correlation but then knowing it may be also associated with body weight and calorie intake then i'll adjust the models in that case to try to dig deeper but i'm doing this basically you know one linear regression model at a time i don't have coding experience i am working with some coders to build an app to do that and that's the the future of this which make it a lot easier to do but um you can go very far just using unadjusted correlations and just that constant it iteration test after test and i do know you you try to control at least from one data set to the next as much as possible experiment i so thank you mike all right any other questions let's let's let's do um i'm like thank you for the talk first um i'm curious um i know you're doing it on yourself i'm curious if you know maybe about the research around women and longevity because obviously women have a like very specific cycle as they go through throughout their lives and then it changes for with pregnancy if they get pregnant and then any kind of things like post pregnancy menopause or um um in between so i'm curious how that correlates with all this research because i assume a cycal body has a different potentially relationship to longevity all these markers yeah for some things there are uh sex independent effects so for example rdw i mean basically on the plot you can see that they're it's increasing during aging no matter if you're a man or a woman but your point is definitely well taken for example there are things like uh immune cells which are biphasic during aging for women only for men it's pretty l you know pretty close to linearly where it increases um so but it can be but even then too it's you know at which point in the cycle are you measuring right so um i think standardization is important so if you're trying to track your own biomarkers as a woman over time you know do you track you know two weeks after your cycle hits do you track you know so trying to standard that standardize that over time so you've got consistent data um or you know or or you know it's one week from the cycle two weeks from the cycle three weeks from the cycle and then separating your data looking at it like that um so standardization is a big part of it but yeah there are there are definitely sex sex independent effects that are are pretty similar across you know men and women um uh but then there are other things that are not but um tracking is the only only way you know to find out i'd say so um how you approach situation if you have one outlier say you have instead of usual distribution one their marker is prett bad say uh red blood distribution uses really better than everything else is is it as how would you yeah so uh that's a great point too um so the i try not to throw away any data even the outliers and the outliers could be i've found something that i don't yet know if it's true or not so if i throw it out maybe i've thrown away a novel hypothesis for example a very high do nicotinic acid uh increased my nad um which isn't isn't a surprise niin increases nad but uh another biomarker done and past was which is an epigenetic speed of aging it sent it to its worst data that i've ever had and if you do like the stats on you know three standard deviations from the average is clearly an outlier but uh that's actually insight into some other processes uh that uh i've tested in since then to try to figure out what was going on there um so i don't throw away any data i i try to use that as the outlier preliminary preliminary data for a mechanism that i haven't yet discovered yet so it's basically cause of concern but could be but or the other side of it too where i've actually stumble on to something that may be beneficial um just i just want to ask about like lymphocyte like in the thymus and the bone marrow um have you looked at ways of preserving that cu i do know that decreases with age and whatnot and thymus like in kids it's very large but in adults it's much smaller it's like a piece of fat right here almost and the inres hormones that help it yeah so i haven't looked that deeply into it but i'm basically looking at the end products right so uh i can't presume to track thymus the thymus function or thymus gland size or over time i mean i'd have to probably get you know ultrasound to see right but if i can look at the end products whether it's specific immune cells and how they change their in aging and then if i have the recipe whether it's diet supplements exercise fitness sleep whatever it may be or some cenotic or geo protector that i can look at the end points now is that because i'm improving some aspect of thymus function or some aspect of overall systemic physiology where i'm you know reducing lymy degradation or prolonging their lifesty i don't know um it you know so i'm basically looking at the end products and indirectly there may be some you know slowing of th thymus uh degeneration over time but i haven't studied it i haven't studied that we got time for one more question kurt kurt you have one question sure i have two questions so i notic you were measuring the the red blood cell distribution but then you said that the size also matters so did you measure absolute size yeah mcv that's the mean corpuscular volume yeah that's one of the biomarkers that i track uh lately they've been trending upward and going in the wrong direction so um but i've i've i'm trying some things you know based on the correlations to try to bring them back to my most youthful data okay the second question was just practical you said you measured since 2015 all of your meals yeah how do you do that at a restaurant like do you bring a scale with you and so uh i generally don't eat out um generally for 10 years or yeah yeah yeah uh if i do if i do it's uh i'll ball it's first of all it's very rare but if i do i'll ballp part the calories but it's such an infrequent event that if i've got a 50-day period uh in between blood test and one of the days i ate out somewhere and i ate something that i don't exactly know what it is in terms of calories when you think about that in the sphere 50 other days where it's completely trapped it's like a a dime in a in a in a dozen dimes or more right so um yeah thank you right
