# Blood Test #1 in 2024: What's My Biological Age?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so apologies if you've heard that a billion times but that's the central premise of this channel and with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the first time in 2024 and note that this is blood test number 49 since 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you have your own blood test data and you want to measure your pheno age or your biological age using this test there'll be a downloadable excel link in a link in the video's description all right so when entering these nine component biomarkers for this test i get a biological age of 34.3 years which is 16.7 years younger than my chronological and note that the data could actually be a bit better than 3 4.3 years as for the 15th consecutive test the lab measurement quest measurement of high sensitivity c reactor protein hs crp was less than3 mg per liter so that's their limit of detection it can't be higher than3 mig per liter but it could be a bit lower and rather than looking at data enter entered into a spreadsheet all blood test data screenshots of the lab report will be coming up shortly now this is just one test and that's it's important to not get too interested in dat from one result or once a year but what are year-to-year changes how are we progressing from year to year are we slowing it from year to year are we are we regressing from year to year so i have for more context let's take a look at biological age results since 2018 as i have 30 blood tests that correspond for pheno age and that's what we can see here so when i first started testing in 2018 to 2019 my average fenal age was 36.1 years and then i started adding hs crp because it's an add-on test here in the states it's not commonly performed on the standard ch panel in cbc i started adding it to every subsequent blood test in 2020 so over 12 tests in 2020 and 2021 average fenal age was 35.6 years and that's probably a closer representation of what my average biological age was in each of those years relative to 2018 and 2019 where it's only three tests over a 2-year span and then in 2022 i significantly reduced to 33.8 years that's over seven tests s tests in 2023 average was 34.7 years not as good as 2022 but still better than 2021 and 2020 and then 2024 is off to a good start with with that 34.3 years now note that feno age increases by 0.9 years for every year of chronological age that passes in other words starting from 2020 every subsequent year from 20 2021 through 2024 there should have been a0 nyear increase even if all my biomarkers stay the same such that my current biological age using this test should probably be somewhere around 38.6 years instead it's in the 33.8 to around 34.7 year range in other words i've resisted an age related increase for this biological age tool now at this point in the video i'd ra i' usually show data for aging. What's my aging. Age but that unfortunately has been recently discontinued so for now let's dig in to the full blood test report and highlight some areas where i'm doing well and some where i have room for improvement and that's what we'll see here so starting with hdl for six consecutive tests hdl is now greater than or equal to 50 milligrams per deciliter and that's potentially important because hdl in the 50 to 60 range is associated with lowest risk for all cause mortality and if you missed that video i'll put it in the right corner now prior to these six tests my 43 test average since 2015 for hdl is about 45 mig per deciliter so we can see that the most recent six tests there's been progress in improving hdl now another point that i'd like to highlight is triglycerides at 63 far from terrible less than 90 is associated with lowest risk of all cause mortality and that's in a large metaanalysis i'll put that in the video description too that paper but when looking at the hazard ratio for coronary heart disease mortality risk or risk of death from heart disease related mortality plotted against serum triglyceride levels we can see that the lowest chd mortality risk was at a triglyceride level of 40 or less so 63 is not bad but i've got room for improvement as i'd like to get it down towards 40 above 40 mig per deciliter we can see a pretty close to linear increase in the hazard ratio for mortality risk from heart disease as as you go above 40 there's a higher risk and note that the green line is the f fully adjusted model the model the blue and the orange are are models that include less variables that were adjusted in their model so fully adjusted model that's the one we want to focus on in green also note crp high sensitivity crp we can see that3 mg per liter number and then what i'd also like to focus on is creatinine now prior to this test of 0.91 mg per deciliter the last five tests were going in the wrong direction at 1.01 mg per deciliter and for comparison in the previous 43 tests creatinine was .95 mg per deciliter so the last five tests it's been uh increasing and that's potentially important but because creatinine increases during aging so that's going in the wrong direction 0.91 is progress towards moving it away from its age related increase which we can see here so serum levels of creatinine on the y- axis plotted against age on the x from about 20 to 90 years and here we can see that red trend line for a increase for an increase for creatinine uh with aging now interestingly in this plot note that above 40 years there starts to become a wide variability in the creatinine measurement in other words people older than 40 can have creatinine levels or more likely to have creatinine levels sometimes as high as 14 milligrams per deciliter relative to younger younger than 40 which you can see on the plot those that that data spread just doesn't exist so for that and some other reasons that i'll cover in a future video creatin may creatinine may not be the best measurement for evaluating kidney function in people older than 40 so with that in mind i also measured catin c and as i mentioned i'll go into that for its own video data coming shortly all right so on to page two of the blood test uh report what i'd like to focus on is albumin at 4.9 is relatively youthful and that's potentially important because albumin levels decline during aging as we also saw in an earlier video it may be an important biomarker for longevity relative to metabolic health or a more important biomarker potentially for longevity relative to hba1c and lipids like or lipoproteins like ldl so we can see that age related decline for abent here serum levels of abent on the y axis plotted against age and this is from birth up through 100 years old and this is a study of about 1.1 million people so in youth alumin levels are relatively high somewhere around 4.6 g per deciliter or 46 g per liter and then we can see that centenarians average values are far lower somewhere around 36 g per liter or 3.6 g per deciliter now an age expected value for my chronological age of 51 would be somewhere around 4.3 g per deciliter so that it's currently at 4.9 and my average is generally around that 4.9 that's a small win but where i do have room for improvement is or at least recent room for improvement is with the mostly liver enzyme because it's also found in muscle alanine aminot transferase alt as shown there with 28 uh units per liter for this test and that's potentially important because we can see in this study of 16.6 million people where alt was associated with hazard ratio for all cause mortality or risk of death for all causes there's a u-shaped association for alt with all cause mortality risk so starting with the reference which was defined as 15 with a hazard ratio of one as the median value for alt increased to 18 and 22 we can see that q2 and q3 the hazard ratio sign significantly decreased as the data in parenthesis that's the 95% confidence interval was completely below one so that's a significant association so in other words median values of 18 to 22 were associated with a lower risk of death for all causes for alt levels uh relative to having 15 so we we can see we got the we've got the beginning of the u but then as alt increases to up to 29 we can see that now we've got got the full u-shaped or a j-shaped curve for alt's association with all cause mortality risk so an alt of 28 for this test if it was chronically around 28 29 we could see that would put me at a higher risk for all cause mortality now i mentioned not just focusing on one test but many tests to get a sense of where one's data actually is for the last 10 tests alt has been an average of 25.3 units per liter whereas for the 10 test before that it was 23 so we can see that it's moving in the wrong direction especially considering that u-shaped or j-shaped association for alt with all cause mortality risk so for this i'll go to the correlations for diet with blood biomarkers and i'll look for ways to try to improve alt levels all right other areas that i can improve are red blood cells in hemoglobin uh red blood cells were close to my lowest uh over many tests at 4.53 and correspondingly since hemoglobin is found in red blood cells it shouldn't be a surprise that there relatively lower too now for the first time in 28 tests hemoglobin is less than 14.9 milligrams per deciliter and that's important because red blood cells and hemoglobin decline during aging so is this the start of an age related decline or is this just the variability in my diet causing a lower hemoglobin level and again i've got some tricks in my uh in my diet by looking at correlations for diet with biomarkers which i'll cover uh in an upcoming video to get hemoglobin levels back to where they us usually are somewhere around 15 mg per deciliter other areas for improvement are mcv so that's the average size and volume of a red blood cell a lower mcv would be smaller volume higher mcv is a higher volume mcv increases during aging my mcv has been increasing for a few tests so that's another one i'm going to work on reverting back to a smaller size and then another uh biomarker i've got my eye on are neutr levels which at 1788 if you look at the reference range it seems perfectly fine but there's data for all cause mortality in a study of about 770,000 people where nutrifil in the two 2,000 to 3,000 range is associated with lowest risk for all cause mortality and then as nutrifil levels go below 2,000 that's associated with a significantly increased all ca mortality risk so if i look at my nutrifil level averages over the last few tests uh it's about 2,000 and i'd probably want to be closer to 2,000 relative to 3,000 when considering that neutr feels can be uh a sign of a proin inflammatory systemic state but do i want them to be 1500 1300 i don't so i've got my eye on those not doing anything yet to try to raise them but uh that's one to keep an eye out for all right now what diet and supplements may correspond to this 17 year younger biological age and as i mentioned i'll cover that in an upcoming video probably coming at the latest by next sunday all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i also
