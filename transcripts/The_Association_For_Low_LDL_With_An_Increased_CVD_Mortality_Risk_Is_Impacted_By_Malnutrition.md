## Transcript

For every age group relatively low ldl is associated with an increased mortality risk from cardiovascular disease so this is data from a study of about 14.9 million people that weren't taking lipid lowering medication so for every age group starting with 18 year olds and all the way up to 99 year olds we can see that for ldl in the 100 to about 120 milligram per deciliter range that's associated with lowest risk for cardiovascular disease related mortality however with lower ldl as shown by the red arrows we can see increased mortality risk from cbd so the big question is why so to gain some insight let's take a look at how ldl changes during aging which is shown here so with the data for men and green and women in red we can see that ldl increases during aging up until about the 50s and then it declines now note that relatively low ldl is found in youth so why would low ldl be associated with an increased all-cause mortality rate or an increased cardiovascular disease mortality risk that seems paradoxical so to gain more insight let's take a look at some data from patients that had coronary artery disease cad and that data is here published in a paper earlier this year non-hdl cholesterol paradox and the effect of underlying malnutrition in patients with coronary artery disease and this was a study that included almost 42 000 people so let's define some terms so first what is the non-hdl cholesterol paradox so that's when low levels of non-hdl cholesterol are associated with an increased cbd mortality risk all right so what about non-hdl cholesterol what is that so that's when total that equals total cholesterol tc minus hdl or more specifically ldl plus vldl plus intermediate density lipoprotein idl now idl is a very minor component of this equation in terms of concentration so i won't focus on it in this video focusing instead on ldl and vldl which are almost exclusively non-hdl cholesterol or make up the majority of it so first relatively low vldl is associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease-related mortality and that's what's shown here so we're looking at the risk for acute myocardial infarction so heart attack sudden coronary death and other coronary death in association with the vldl cholesterol concentration so for people that had less than 20 for vldl when compared with higher levels of vldl 20 to 29 and greater than 30 we can see that having a low vldl was associated with lowest risk for these cardiovascular disease related outcomes when compared with higher levels of vldl which had a significantly increased risk as shown there so from this we can conclude that because low vldl is associated with a reduced cardiovascular disease mortality risk not an increased cbd mortaliters as shown by the non-hdl cholesterol paradox the non-hdl cholesterol paradox would then mostly involve ldl so just keep that in mind as we go forward so then why is low non uh hdl cholesterol significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in coronary artery disease patients to start to address that let's take a look at the association between non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality risk and that's what's shown here so note that this study involved people with an average age of 65 and that it was 80 men included in the study so first note that lowest all-cause mortality risk in this subject population uh had a non-hdl cholesterol level of four to five millimolar which is approximately 155 to 193 milligrams per deciliter but then we can see that non-hdl cholesterol paradox there so less than 85 for the non-hdlc was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in coronary artery disease patients but note that this is an unadjusted association and there are many other factors that may impact this association so it's important to account for those variables in this model so what happens to all cause mortality risk when this association includes adjustment for other health related variables so what are those variables that can impact the association and they include an older age sex other cbd related comorbidities afib or atrial fibrillation high blood pressure hypertension elevated blood glucose is indicated by type 2 diabetes poor poor kidney function is indicated by chronic kidney disease ckd which was more specifically an egfr less than 60. Anemia as indicated by the relatively low concentration of red blood cells in blood is indicated by hematocrit levels and lung disease as indicated by copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease so when these when this association includes these variables now the some of the risk has gone away so we can see that although uh it's still significant the lowest all-cause mortality risk for a relatively higher each a non-hdlc is right at the border of statistical significance and similarly similarly the lower non hdlc that increased risk has also been reduced by a bit as we can see that the confidence interval is right at the border of statistical significance so from this we can conclude that age sex and comorbidities affect the relationship between non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality risk in coronary artery disease patients but note that the title of this paper includes malnutrition so how does malnutrition contribute to the association for non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality risk so first how did they define malnutrition so they included blood test data for albumin lymphocytes and total cholesterol and then also as a quick aside note that because this the association for non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality risk because total cholesterol includes non-hdl cholesterol the only other component that isn't included is hdl so by including total cholesterol in these models it's essentially accounting for hdl so what happens to all-cause mortality risk when the association for non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality is adjusted for malnutrition as defined by these three factors and now we're looking at it looks like a totally different curve so after accounting for albumin lymphocytes and total cholesterol non higher non-hdl cholesterol so greater than 85 milligrams per deciliter is now associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and conversely the non-hdl cholesterol paradox is gone so that we see that having a non-hdl cholesterol of less than 85 milligrams per deciliter is now associated significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk in coronary artery disease patients so from this we can conclude that malnutrition may be driving the effect of a low non-hdl cholesterol on all-cause mortality risk in cad patients so before going forward it's important to also account for those other factors that could uh impact this this association including age sex and comorbidity so what happens to this plot if those variables are included in the malnutrition model so that's what we can see here and the data looks almost essentially the same with very some very small changes we can still see that having a non-hdl cholesterol level greater than 85 is still significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and then that the non-hdl cholesterol paradox is still uh it's it's now reversed i mean you still see that reduced all-cause mortality risk granted it's right at the border of statistical significance you can see that the confidence interval the red dashed lines are right at a hazard ratio of one but nonetheless we can see that malnutrition may be driving the effect of having a low non-hdl cholesterol on all-cause mortality risk at least in this subject population coronary artery disease patients so the big question though is why why would malnutrition drive the effect of low non-hdl cholesterol or more specifically potentially ldl on all-cause mortality risk so note that having low levels of albumin lymphocytes and hdl are a part of the aged phenotype so let's take a look at that data and i presented this in other videos so i'm gonna kind of fly through this uh but if you've missed it just uh do a search for album and lythocytes and hdl on my on my channel and you can get more in-depth uh breakdowns so albumin levels are high in youth but decline during aging so we're looking at uh levels of serum levels of abdomen on the y-axis plotted against age all the way up to 100 years and we can see that albumin levels peak in youth from values of about 46 in men and 45 in women and then declined to about 36 grams per liter in 100 year olds so what's the importance of having youthful levels of albumin so we can assess that by looking at all-cause mortality risk which is which is what's shown here uh hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the albumin concentration on the x and we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with an albumin level that's found in youth 46 grams per liter and then as the abdomen concentration declines as found in aging we see that significantly increased all-cause mortality risk as indicated by the red lines similarly lymphocytes are high in youth but also decline during aging as shown here so levels of lymphocytes on the y axis again plotted versus age all the way up to 100 years and with the red line we can see that lymphocytes decline during aging so just like the album data what's the importance of having youthful levels of lymphocytes so we can assess that by looking at all-cause mortality risk as shown there that's on the y-axis plotted against the lymphocyte count on the x and we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with having two trillion lymphocytes per liter as shown there by the that little the vertical black lines uh on the x-axis but then as lymphocyte levels decline we can see that's again significantly increased all-cause mortality risk now as i mentioned earlier malnutrition also included total cholesterol and because we're looking at the associate association for non-hdl cholesterol with all-cause mortality risk this becomes an hdl story because total cholesterol equals non-hdl cholesterol plus hdl as hdl is the only factor that's not included in that model so hdl also is high in youth relatively high in youth but also declines during aging as shown here so hdl peaks in youth from values of about 64 in women and 56 in men and then steadily declines during aging for women as shown there and then for men there's a pretty rapid decline into the about the 30s after which it's mostly uh stable in the low 50s afterwards all the way up to 80 88 years the endpoint age uh age range on this plot so relatively low hdl is also associated with an increased all-cause mortality rates as shown here with this all-cause mark mortality plot so uh it for values less than 45 for men and less than 55 for women we can see that hdl uh we can see an increase uh all-cause mortality is for relatively lower levels of hdl so to bring it back to the original question why is ldl less than 100 to 120 milligrams per deciliter associated with an increased mortality risk from cardiovascular disease so low ldl within the context of low albumin lymphocytes and hdl which is defined as malnutrition that also equals the aged phenotype so that collectively could potentially explain the increased cardiovascular uh mortality risk when in the context of low ldl all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on
