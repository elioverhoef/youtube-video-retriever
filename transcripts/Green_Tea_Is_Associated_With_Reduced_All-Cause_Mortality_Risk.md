Green tea is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk so let's take a look at that data on the y-axis we've got the hazard ratio of all cause mortality or all-cause mortality risk plotted against daily green 18 consumption in grams so grams of green tea consume per day and then there are three groups the whole population current smokers and never smokers so starting with the whole population this study included about 165 000 people and then in terms of what was significant we go to the hazard ratio of one and note that when the 95 percent confidence interval which are the dashed lines when those are completely below one or above one we have a statistically significant association so for the whole population we can see that green tea greater than about six grams per day is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk but note that there are two other groups of data on this plot including data for current smokers which was most of this population around 117 000 people in red but then also data for the never smokers and because never smokers would be most relevant to longevity i'm only going to focus on that data which is the green line so for the never smokers we can see that green tea consumption above zero grams of green tea per day was associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk as indicated by the green lines with the lowest all-cause mortality risk being between 7 and 11 grams of green tea per day so this is just one study is there more data so for that we go to a 2015 meta-analysis of five studies that included more people than the previous study about about 201 000 people and on the y-axis once again we've got all cause mortality risk plotted against green tea consumption on the x-axis but in this case this is cups per day not grams of green tea per day and when compared with a hazard ratio of one we can see that up to about five cups of green tea per day was significantly associated with the reduced all-cause mortality risk now this was 2015 data is there more recent data are there more recent studies so in 20 2019 a minute analysis for green tea consumption and its association with all cause mortality risk was published including eight cohort studies and that study included more than 313 000 so the largest sample size of the two previous studies and this study had a wide age range from 40 to about 103 years and then breaking down the data that that's that was in this study so in terms of green tea consumption it was separated into four groups so less than one cup one to two cups three to four cups and greater than five cups of green tea per day and then we can see the all-cause mortality risk or the hr hazard ratio for all cause mortality risk and then we can see the 95 confidence interval and remember when that data in parentheses is either completely below one or completely above one we have a statistically significant association and then data for men is in on the top about 145 000 men and data for women is on the bottom about 169 000 women and then we're looking at age r2 which was model 2 the fully adjusted multivariate model so when compared with people who drank less than one cup of green tea per day we can see that one to two cups three to four cups and greater than five cups per day were each associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so from this we can see that greater than one cup of green tea per day is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk in both men and women in this meta-analysis from 2019. Now if anyone's come across a larger study since 2019 please leave it in the comments as far as i know this is the largest study on green tea and its association with all cause mortality risk to date now most of the green tea all-cause mortality data is in japanese cohorts so with these data in mind since 2018 i've used loose leaf japanese green tea since 2018 and this is the exact brand that i use the company that i use and uh so what i do is i take the loose leaf green tea i put it in a stainless steel ball add boiled water and then we get the green tea as it looks on the right with and then i add a little bit of of lemon so fortunately this company just started offering discount links and i was able to obtain one of those discount links so if you're interested in buying green tea loose leaf high quality organic green tea that link will be in the video's description that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links besides green tea and we also have merch including discount links for epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in that that link and all the other links in addition to the papers referenced in the video will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
