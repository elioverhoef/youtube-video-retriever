By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey everyone today we've got dr vincenzo santino who is an assistant professor at the national university of singapore within the department of biochemistry today he'll present his lab's work on trigonelline or otherwise known as methyl nicotinic acid which has a positive impact on nad intracellular nad levels muscle function aging and longevity and may be even better than nmn or nr in terms of stability so with that welcome dr antino thank you michael uh thanks for the for the invitation it's a great pleasure actually to be able to share some of the data that we're going to be actually published online soon on this new nad precursor trion ellen as you mentioned and this in particular it's work uh that i want to highlight also the contribution that uh came from my previous um appointment when i was working in switzland withness l reseearch so actually this work is a beautiful example of also how uh companies and academic environments can work together in order to bring translational findings closer to the both scientific community but also to the public so without um further let's say delays i want to introduce you some of the key findings that came up from our research on trigonelline for muscle benefits and longevity across species so just to give you a bit of a context about what is sarcopenia so sarcopenia is basically um a loss of functional uh let's say um outcomes in muscle not just in terms of of muscle mass but also really in terms of muscle functionality so ability to move strength and so on it's of course an age associated diseases so its prevalence is increasing with the fact that the most advanced civilizations and groups over in the world are of course becoming aging or super aging and this is for instance very true for singapore for instance where i'm currently working uh but from a molecular perspective um people that are familiar with the aging field they may be aware that the uh aging process from a biological standpoint is composed of several interwin hallm marks which are essentially declines in the different cellular functions and from this point of view muscle aging and the force of muscle sarcopenia are kind of sharing some of these old marks of aging and disease for instance we know that for muscle aging and sarcopenia there is increased inflammation in our muscles disfunction of mitochondria which are the centers for producing energy and important metabolites in our cells increased oxidative stress also increase fiic damage within the muscle compromising essentially the muscle elasticity and ability to function and very importantly there is also dysfunction of satellite cells which are the muscle stem cells which are important for supporting muscle regeneration or even maintaining muscle mass in that sense and imbalancing protein turnover meaning that there is tendentially and often muscle aging and sarcopenia more muscle catabolism so loss of protein rather than synthesis so from a clinical perspective how do we measure sarcopenia uh there are three at least clinical outcomes that need to be uh kept in mind for the rest of the discussion that we used also in our studies and these are aligned essentially between different consortium this is the for instance we have the european consortium and here is the below you can see the parameters measured from the asian consortium and actually these are basically the three same same parameters which are gate speed grip strength and appendicular lean mass meaning if you lose if your values decline below this threshold values that are indicated here people will be scored or diagnosed as psychopathic now another key molecular factor that has been um coming up in the literature from different studies including from my own research but also from very famous group worldwide such as for instance david sinclair or yan over and so on i've actually highlighted the key role of a coenzyme that is involved in more than 500 reactions in our bodies and pretty much involved in every in most of the cellar marks of aging that i highlighted before and this is called nad plus so nad plus has been shown to be important to support mitochondrial function to uh support o redux reactions reduce inflammation favor dna repair and so on and what people have really focused on um including us both at the preclinical level and more recently people are starting to understand how at the clinical level with exercise or lifestyle or supplementation how we can actually use certain approaches in order to maintain nd and what kind of benefits actually supporting or maintaining n levels can bring to the different parts of our bodies so basically through exercise or diet or even using nad boosters supp nad has been shown preclinically at least to improve pretty much every organ in your body that you can think of not just during aging but also during age associated diseases and all this it's basically summarized in this beautiful review from indeed from david sinclair in this case now keeping in mind the important role of anad as a a key coenzyme most of the cell or marks of aging and the fact that during the aging process um muscle mass declines rises and also the other h marks of aging are starting to be um evident what was done before in a sl research before actually i joined the company there was this study published in 2019 where what what the study did they looked they did an observational study where they compared in a singaporean c actually in male singaporeans either l elderly or um age matching individual with sarcopenia assessed with the three parameters that i mentioned before so grip strength gauge speed and appendicular lean mass and what they did they took mass of biopsis from these patients and then they looked at different molecular signatures in these tissues what emerged is that on the other on one end mitochondrial uh transcription pathways that were completely downregulated and also oxos indicating proteins indicating mitochondrial respiration complexes that were completely downregulated indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and very importantly what was also measured in a few biopsies that were still available from these patients is that anad plus levels were significantly lower in the muscle tissues also very importantly um if you look at the muscle function so again the three par clinical features of muscle health these were actually positively correlated with the muscle n meaning that higher muscle ned correlates with better muscle health overall and this kind of resonates with what i just mentioned before with n being very essential to support normal anasis and functional um outcomes as we age now at the time i joined and i started leading the group on this project what we also had available at the time were actually serum samples from the same cord so what we wanted to do there is to look at um through different metabolomics analysis what kind of metabolites were changing at the systemically reflect what we have just observed for sarcopenia so could we identify either new biomarkers or new metabolites that could be used as as targets or therapeutic interventions for muscle aging of psyopia we looked at different metabolites including different kind of vitamins so we did also we measure also on a platform all kinds of vitamin b3 rel families members which are essentially the precursors for for the biosynthesis of nad plus of all these molecules the only one that was um significantly changing and it was down regulated in copia actually was this molecule called trigonelline it it also turns out that if we looked again at the three clinical outcomes of muscle health so lin mass grip stength and walking speed serum trigonelline levels were positively correlated with muscle so as we s for nad levels in muscle serum trigonal levels were also positively linked with with better muscle and also when we looked now trying to link what would happen if we would look at higher levels of nad in with genes that would be modulated in our muscles what it turns out is that the most positively enriched pathways in muscle when we have high levels of trigonum it was actually a mitochondrial oxfa so mitochondri related pathways for energy production in our cells which makes in that sense if we think of possible link with nad that would make completely sense because nad and molecules that support nad production they also generally linked with better mitochondrial function so with this in mind we decided indeed to look at what what is trigonelline so how does it look like and how it could be related to mitochondrial health or with nad metapolis when we look at the structure of trigonelline it turns out that in it's pretty much a meated form of nicotinic acid as you actually had anticipated before michael and uh from the literature the only things that we could find from the past and this is very old findings from trigonelline is that it seems to have beneficial effects from the metabolic perspective so it seems to work preclinically in for instance models of diabetic um disease diabetes it can lower plasma liver cholesterol in ntgs for instance in um um preclinical models of nes of liver disease essentially it can improve um uc transport um but essentially we didn't find much as that would link it specifically to its mechanism of action when we looked at the origin of this molecule so uh where is it present i mean how do we find it in nature it turns out that is mostly produced by plants and to some extent by the um it's found also in the human gut gut microbiome but really in the in the the majority of chon you can find in nature is present is present in plants in particular in phen greek seeds and coffee beans so things that are part of our basically regular nutrition for people that for instance drink coffee and the only other thing that we could find from literature in the past it's a very old study from a japanese group that showed that if you would take liever extracts from from different animals and you would add trigonelline to these liver extracts you would get demalation of trigonelline into nin so with these hypothesis in mind we wanted to actually start looking whether trigonelline could be compar like an en precursor that could be comp comp to to other nad procures before we go into the effect on nad we also wanted to actually understand how the potential of using this molecule for human application so one important parameter is actually for all these molecules in general for supplements but also for drugs it's their stability we know that for instance for n precursors such as nr and nnm they are actually um theyve been shown to be effective preclinically and there is um clinical trials ongoing however the the these molecules are not to be interconverted into for instance degraded into nicotinic acid or into n by our microbiome and they are rather unstable in the human serum as you can see here we did a time course just spiking the molecules into human serum at 37 degrees and we follow them over time you can see that nr and then nm which are part of the savage pathway of nad biosynthesis they actually very rapidly disappear from the from the c in that sense because actually they get um degrad and they release actually n or nicotinamide which is also part of the saage pathway of the the nad biosynthesis um but it's considered to be to some extent also degradational product of nad so this is now quite very established also with our assays and it was already reported by other groups before importantly for trigonelline being just a mediated form of nicotinic acid that's not the case so trigonelline is very very stable even more than 24 hours in serum and of course it doesn't release it doesn't degrade into n just in a let's say body free system just in a in pure serum so with this in mind and so knowing its stability and knowing its link now with mitochondria and possibly with with this with n in muscle we wonder whether trigon could actually act as an nad precursor in animal species and impact longevity and muscle so we started by uh doing very simple essays so the proof of concept is whether if we supplement tri gonell into different model organisms or in vitro systems whether we can increase nad levels that was the case so when we for instance provide trigonelline in different doses to hsmm cells which are primary human myotube cells so derived from from human donors we can see that those dependently trigonelline could increase nad plus levels true this is true also when we use primary human myot tubes not only from healthy patients but also from psychop patent meaning that the conversion of trigonelline into um into intermediates that can lead to n biosynthesis is still occurring even if you may have sarcopenia and that's actually important to know from a translational application perspective we we then also also wanted to use um simple model of of aging and this invivo can be done for instance with nematodes like c elegant which age quite rapidly and you can supplement them with drugs for instance and then study mechanism of action on the drugs in this case what we did we compared the nad levels between young and old worms and you can see that if we take day day8 worms which are already aged they show a decline in nad which was significantly rescued by supplementing trigonelline at 1 mill for eight days in these worms but more importantly we wanted to then validate the possible effects in bivo to do so we took in this case still young mice so 3 months old mice we gavage trion in 300 migr per kilogram and this is a quantity of an amount of chellin that is equimolar to nr for instance so this means that we are using what people use for nr when they do studies in rodents in order to increase nad and bring benefits uh to the to their mouse system so with this in mind we did a garage we for two hours and then we collected different tissues and measured n plus what you can see here if we look for instance a liver muscle kidney and blood in this case sheon in significantly increase nad levels after 2 hours in all these tisses one question that we have actually got quite consistently and that's why i'm showing now also this new data that that are part of the story that will be um that will be published soon is what happens actually what are the values of trigonal in itself so how bi available is trigonelline when we look now at the same tissues where we have seen the increase in nad so what we did here again we took the mice we gavaged them with the same amount of trigonelline and then we follow we measure trigonelline with um with a mass spectrometry with absolute quantification either 2 hours or we let essentially like a wash out period of overnight meaning like more than 12 hours in this case what you can see here is that depending on the tissue you may have already baseline levels of trigonelline which can be either very low so we are here in the low micromolar range or they are even below limit of detection for instance for gastr in in muscle in this particular case but upon supplementation which we going to at two hours we get a pretty strong increase significant increase in trigonelline in all the measured tissues including in muscle in kidney liver and in plasma and of course a huge excretion of trigonelline urine this actually has already been kind of described in other studies also in humans but nevertheless after two hours we are able in all these tissues to reach a quite high actually micromolar range especially in plasma we are in the range of 100 to 250 micromolar for instance after 2 hours but you can see that after wash out period we almost reach based on levels again most of in most of the cases we in liver for instance we still retain a significant increase of trigonelline but for instance in muscle and in plasma we al almost go back to baseline in this case meaning that the wash out is quite quick it still retains trigonelline in most of the tissues but for let's say supplementation purposes this is useful information to that will help us to decide or define in the future whether how free how much trion can stay in our body and how frequently we may want to supplement it or not but now let's go to the mechanism of trigonelline so we said it's a mutilated form of nicotinic acid but we have we nobody had actually shown that it could actually work as nicotinic acid so that was the purpose of these experiments that you see here in cells so here what we what i'm giving you here is a simple cartoon of the n biosynthesis pathways in our bodies you have the savage pathway which i mentioned before which makes use of nicotin amide or n and nicotin amide gets usually converted into n&m which is another known n precursor currently already available as a supplement and of course you have nicotin ami riboside which also can be converted into nm and then this basically can then lead to the formation of nad plus basically with one to two reactions in this case and then you have the press under the pathway which is the one that nicotinic acid uses in order to generate nad through several reactions and what i want to also um bring you to your attention is that for all of these pathways there are several key enzymes that are important for the conversion of the intermediates into the nad pool and some of these enzymes like mprt which is the key price enzyme to convert nicotinic acid can be inhibited by two drxy nicotinic acid or nmpt it has a specific inhibitor called fk 66 which can be used to block essentially the salvage pathway and in this case an r being downam of the of the nmpt and also independent of the press pathway can be used as a sort of positive control in order to increase en independently of um of inhibition of these pes so that's what we did here we went back to our muscle muscle cell line system and we simply provide similar amounts one mill of trigonelline and nicotinamide riboside and you can see that both very significantly increase nad levels in these cells what happens now when we provide two drxy nicotinic acid that we block the price under the pathway trigonelline doesn't work anymore but nr which is independent of this pathway actually can still significantly increase energy levels but what happens now when we combine fk866 to block the salvage pathway with a two drxy nicotinic acid to block the price pathway what you can see here first of all is that fk 66 so blocking the salvage pathway induces a very strong nad depletion phenotype in the cells but with trigonally or nr which are both independent of the savage pathway with fk 66 can actually both rescue completely with trigonelline and even boost further with an n the n levels even in the presence of of of the inhibitor however when we now combine also with to nicotinic acid and we block the price and pathway you completely lose the effect of trigonelline again proving that trigonelline works mostly through the price standard pway we have done also metabolomics analysis in order to prove that the downstream metabolites of the price standard pathway are increased following trigonal in administration and that turns out to be the case what happens now when we want to look at function outcomes in cells so as i mentioned any plus is very important to support mitochondial function for instance through the action of se twins and mitochon biogenesis so one thing that we wanted to to to observe is what happens to mitochondrial function when we deplete n and when when we rescue nad with our uh nad precursors what we did here we measured mitochondri membrane potential or maximum respiration through seor methodology you can see that when we use fk 66 again to block the salvage pathway as we saw for n ad that goes down also mitochondrial membrane potential declines and mitochondri respiration also declines which is is in line with what we would expect from the interdependency between mitochondri and n however again now blocking all only the fk 66 means that when we use an arm or tonalin we can actually rescue completely the mitochondri membrane potential in this case however when we now block the price standard pathway on top of the savage pathway trigonelline is not effective anymore in this case while an r can still function pretty well and the same happens with mitochondrial respiration again trigonelline can rescue the inhibition of the savage pathway but not when also the price standard pathway is inhibited also this is something very it's a it's an observation i want to bring to our attention is that differently from n levels where you have seen that nr could very potently uce nad levels even more than trigonal in the cell line when we look at function readouts on mitochondrial health like respiration mitochondri membrane potential so downstream of the boosting effect actually the effects between an r and trigonelline are quite comparable and we have observed actually the same also when we go in in vivo with nematodes for instance when we look at lifespan or or muscle integrity so what i want to really bring to our attention is that even if any boosters may affect any levels differently when we look at functional efficacy of these precursors in this case mitochondria but it could be anything could be mobility muscle strength or something else it's very important to um to keep in mind that these compounds may actually lead to comparable efficacy and that is very important meaning that we need to also know the biology of these compounds in order to understand which cohorts or applications may be more may benefit more from using different precursors so next we wanted to move actually to observing benefits of trigonelline uh in a more functional kind of readout setting and for this we went back to an um an accelerated model of aging if you want or a short lived animal like c elegance why because in this animals basically within 10 to 11 days like in this case you can observe a loss of muscle integrity so these are muscle fibers in young adult worms versus day 11 adult worms you can see the loss of mle fiber integrity but following 10 days of supplementation which trional we were able to maintain to a certain degree more muscle integrity more integrity of the muscle fibers compared to the 11 this was reflected by an improvement in mobility of the worms during aging you can see here at two time points that the paralysis the worms is actually lower when the worms are treated with trional and importantly this reflects also on life span in these animals is very in this these are short lived animals so you can see that the control worms they leave maximum approximately 24 25 days however with trional we are able to extend the lifespan up to about 30 days with a median increase of about 17.4% but this is not true when we actually uh inhibit or we repress genetically the expression of mprt in the worm which is essentially the key um enzyme that is important to use trigonelline or nin so this also proves that also in vivo there's a dependency of trigonelline with the price pathway so if we cannot use the press pathway we lose the majority of the effects of tonell in this case and finally we wanted to actually test benefits now in an invivo model during aging and in this case we used in collaboration with with the gordon lynch in melbourne we made use of aged mice and we treated them chronically with trigonal so what we did in particular we took two years old mice which were fed either a control diet or a trigonal supplemented diet again with the same quantity that we used also for the gage experiment and we supplemented this mice for about three months and then at the end of the study we measured things such as grip strength and in c to muscle force which i will explain in a moment so at the end of the study we collected uh the different tissues and then we looked at things like for instance lim mass and we measure the phenotypes for muscle health so one thing that emerged from this study is that the limb mass actually in this mice at the end of the study was not impacted it's also true that mice compared to humans do not necessarily become sarcopenic very easily so you really need geriatic mice meaning much older than two years old in order to start observing some consistent loss of lin mice and also an important thing that we did here we measured the peak force in the tibialis of the anteriori of the mice meaning that we put the mice to sleep and then we basically use electric stimulation in order to cause the maximal tetanic contraction in the muscle of the mice and what we observed is that the peak force in his mice was not changed at baseline meaning that the maximum force even if you use trigonelline in his mice is not going to increase however what we did here using the same setup we now started to stimulate the muscle with several repeated contractions over time so in order to induce muscle f so in humans that would be a little bit like if you were to lift weights for instance and do repetitions up to a point where your muscle get fatigu then you don't feel that you can lift anything anymore right so that essentially your muscles are not able to contract well anymore so what you can see here is when when do we do this in rodents you have here in gray this line is for a young cohort so it's our reference cohort and then we have an aged cohort here you can see in black where you can see that the percentage of initial force is declining following the repeated control traction you can see a more significant and steeper decline compared to young mice which is expected during the aging process however the mice that were treated chronically with trigonelline were able to maintain an intermediate level so we were actually able to improve the amount of force that were able to generate in spite of the musle fa protocol in this case and importantly this was also mirrored by a small but significant increase in grip strength in the in the mice when before essentially sacrifice so in leaving mice in this case so with this what we can say is that trigonal in spite of not modifying the peak force at baseline this and we there's certainly more experimentation to be done is the trigonal levels decline in a human sarcopenic cohort and associated with mitochondri function trigonal is an n precursor across pieces through the price pathway and this seems to be well tolerated at least in road and studies and to promote muscle resilience to sustain contractions in aging rant another piece of data i just want to um to to show you before we conclude is that our court in singapore was based on a very small cohort of individuals but we have been able to replicate in a larger court this is an iranian court with more than 100 individuals we have been able to replicate the association between grip strength and trigonal levels which we had seen in the singaporean court for trigonelline and also importantly we don't see in this case we have actually also um diet um information from this from this individuals what we don't see is an association between caffeine intake and vitamin b3 intake in this case meaning that the effects that we see the association we see between trigonal and grip strength is not although we have have seen a partial association with things like folate and fibers meaning that probably there may be a connection between trigonelline and the one carbon metabolism or the fid cycle for instance however we don't have now at the end data that this would be something that needs to be investigated further and along with the other questions that i'm highlighting here about the demalation process of trigonelline which for m mos is not established and at this point whether supplementing trigonelline would have real impact for muscle healthy uns so i think with this yeah i'm i'm done with my presentation and we can go for some questions michael yeah so so that was fantastic i mean uh and i usually don't uh give out superlatives but that was fantastic i think this is tremendous data tremendous story the whole field is obsessed with nr nmn and basically your data shows that as good right maybe even better and uh and and even the the the the part that really gets me is the stability of nr nmn basically going away after 24 hours and then trigonelline it's essentially what was it uh 80% of the maximum 24 hours l something yeah so um yeah we have 48 hours anyway so trion is quite stable but of course it's not made of it's it's a simpler molecule than an r than an r and an m because it doesn't have the ribos group right so it doesn't yeah it doesn't say it doesn't suffer from the same um degradation step as an rnm but this is important to know because yeah that means that these other precursors can be degraded into n and then eventually into nicotinic acid so yeah so then the question is is it a uh so you did start looking into the diet story but you know for for the you know i and i get that coffee wasn't associated with uh serum levels of trigonelline but as you mentioned the fibers and folate may be related so legumes actually you know chickpeas so it's funny it's in part inspired by by your work that and i have my own metabol data using metabolomic kit that has trion and in my data it's been consistently low like .1 micromar compared to their reference range so nonetheless i looked at i don't know if you if you know how deeply i quantify my diet every day but yeah i saw a little bit some of your your other talks on this yeah cool so so uh i looked into my diet and i basically had no trigonelline so i was like all right and my nad levels have been consistently at least plasma intracellular blood intra cellular levels have been consistently low 20 to 25 micromolar compared to what a young reference population would so anyway i looked into my diet and you know i basically don't have any trigonelline pre or or tri dietary trigonelline so uh for for the last blood test which i took on monday i uh added chickpeas which you know have three based on studies they have trigonelline i don't yet have the nad data that will should be coming next week i also don't know if the approximately 20 20 milligrams per day of trigonelline from chickpeas is enough to impact nad because your dose was 1600 exactly so yeah yeah that's that's an important point because the thing is what we have done in our preclinical studies was to really try to match what we know for nr and for anm in prclinical studies so basically at the equimolar level we are using the same amounts that we know that they in fe n levels in in er rodents when you use an r&m and it turns out that that works also for trigell so an important question would be how low we can go with trion in either supplementation through the diet in order to have a a function link with n effects right so we don't know i mean in sense we don't we don't have preclinical studies with rodents in know that show this we have not done those let's say escalation deescalation in order to measure the min minimal efficacy dose what we know in humans from our studies with the metabolic platforms that i've used is that a thing in our singaporean court we were at bas line in a range of very low it's like one to four micro which actually matches what you would found endogenously for things like an r or an m baseline in humans for instance also from the work of brer so i think all these n precursors at baseline are probably going to be in that range in the low micromolar range and supplementation depending on again on the stability of the molecule how pure is either the supplement or the diet how rich is the diet in the supplements will give you a certain amount of b availability in plasma and then eventually in tissues so these are all questions that for trigonelline we we need to assess because we only have the bioavailability but with 300 milligram per kilogram at this moment yeah it it may actually be a low dose you know i don't know if it'll be 20 milligrams of trigonelline per day but just in support of that in my own data not to make it about me but 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid almost doubles my nad now would 60 milligrams of trigonelline impact the same and are there functional i don't get any functional improvements by doubling nad at that point but for some people maybe you know anyway it may not be where you've got to go to 800 milligrams or or you know super high uh all right so then that that also gets to another question of besides the optimal dose you mentioned that it's produced by the gut microbiome do you know which bacteria can produce so that's that's exactly i've been looking a little bit in the literature so there are a couple of studies that i've linked it to essentially got microbiome for instance in diabetic patients and in also people like they measured fal microbiome of people that do for instance adlets versus um normal let's say control people but the problem is so they detected changes in trigonelline so actually for instance they saw an increased presence of trigonelline in the in the f related to the fal microbiome in people that do for instance sports however there's no clear bacterial species that has been shown to to be able to produce toate for instance nicotinic acid in this case most likely and that's actually one of the other questions that could be important to to understand so we know that for instance the gut microbiome can take for instance num and then generate a name from it whether it's also able and which species would be able to meate nicotinic acid to generate trigonelline and in what conditions it's also known in that sense so yeah this is another the physiology let's say of the metabolis of trion for humans or mammals it's rather unnown because this is pretty much the first study that points at its metabolization by by by system essentially so far was only known for plants right so yeah so you've got a whole there's so much work that that right that done in this is yeah essentially this was a bit we hope that this will open a little bit well the field in sense also towards the understanding of the n metabolis complexity because there's also more and more evidence i mean the beautiful work of b that we already mentioned rabinov it's on the n fluxes and the conversion by the gut microbiome i mean these are all very elegant studies but there also work from um from a japanese group showing that for instance even nr needs to be uh converted to some extent again through nicotinic acid and requires essentially mty h he froze froze fenzo you froze you froze okay we both froze sorry you were saying nr and then it froze okay so i was mentioning that also nr has been shown that indeed you know most of the ned uh boosting effects that we see from anr in vivo are also relying on the need for expression of mprt meaning that there is um interconversion of anr which is through base exchange reactions it's another entic process that occurs in the cells uh that generates nicotinic acid from nr and that leads to an increase so meaning that again when we take these precursors there will part of it will go as it is but a large part of it will be interconverted into the other metabolites and for trigonal we actually do not know exactly if this is the case so if it can generate other if it cross feed let's say into the other pathways and to what extent and why we don't know this yet yeah so um okay so some more questions uh so then that big question of where does the methyl group go like so you know you've got trigonelline one meth for again for people don't don't know it's methylated nicotinic acid that's got to go somewhere right so that opens up you know whether it's um if if it's based on the pathway in coffee for example you know so um that reaction is is trigonelline plus aenos homosysteine and that methyl group goes to acenil homosysteine forming aenos methionine which which you know i brought i raised you know an email that that could potentially lead to a reduction in homocysteine which is important for like vascular health and it's associated with dementia risk but then also the saden methionine is required for melatonin production which is involving sleep which declines during aging so these are three very important pathways oxida metabolism sleep and vascular health so where does that methyl group go yeah yeah so that's that's another big question in sense that we when we did our experiments to to kind of we have focused on the nad metabolon part so what we did we have used labeled isotopically lab label trigonelline in order to trace where the backbone of trional would go once it gets deated however with our type of labeling that we have used we are not able actually to follow the me group to see where it would actually go right so at this moment with with the experiments we have done so far we can't really predict whe whether the med group will really feed into the let's say the the hosen cycle um what we know is that my my feeling also based on this human um the interaction that we see between for instance things like folate and trigonelline in the human cords is that i wouldn't be surprised if indeed there would be a way i mean the fact that trigonal essentially would generate this me group that that would essentially feed into the the h assistant cycle and that would you know that cycle interacts with the fid cycle and that's why you get the interaction between trional and fet so i think i feel like there might be something there but we are looking at fet and trion so we are at the two extremes of the two cycles so i think that's that would require more specific metabolomic fluxes studies in order to really observe these metabolites especially maybe in an invo context because in a invitro system like cell lines which are already kind of you know rich in metabolites and very rich medias culture conditions not you sometimes you don't observe very strong changes in this component so i think the idea would for me would be to go in b and look at this fluxes in b but now with have focus on this two cycles cool the other aspect too there's a fourth component i guess which would be epigenetics if you've got an extra methyl group now the conversion to nicotinic acid if there's hypomethylation during aging you could potentially get genes that are turned on because now you can methylate them so is that on the list to to look at epigenetic exactly yeah so yeah so this also looking at this looking at things like even mation patterns for instance for checking whether trional could impact you know or even metil clocks you know by looking at mation patterns is all this all needs to be done essentially so now that we have kind of found the first let's say evidence that this could be the case i mean the trional works by increasing n but also by losing this met group but now yet a wall let's say range of experiments in this direction needs to be done here cool so uh so then two other avenues that uh you know one is that um trigonelline is also increased in it's a ureic metabolite so people who have disease uh it's increased in blood but yet chronic kidney disease is also linked with sarcopenia so if it was and i i see i saw your data and and its impact on muscle muscle function and and longevity but how how can we reconcile these two bits of data where you've got one where trigonelline within the context of adverse health uh seem seems to not have an effect on muscle you know uh at least muscle mass sarcopenia you know in ckd versus the other side of it where it's direct you have direct effects that you've shown how do you how how do how you reconcile yeah so i mean this is something else that needs to be assessed more i mean especially the physiology a little bit studying in the context of um either in humans so looking at preclinical models of for instance ckd actually there is not at the baseline but at least in terms of supplementation of trional there's something that i would say plays in its fav in terms of having good for kidney because there's a preclinical study just recently published oh sorry my camera is kind of weird um that actually has shown that supplementing trigonelline in a model of diabetic nephropathy actually is beneficial for kidneys so they supplemented mice with diabetic nephropathy at 50 and milligram per kilogram of trigonelline for like eight weeks or something and then they looked at kidney fibrosis kidney you know albura creatinine and so on and actually all these parameters were improved um meaning that actually again in this case you know it's a bit of a same like high trional is also good for your kidney in this case so in a model of disease of course in a context of sop this yet but what we need what we actually is that trion um i say during sopia the human data from the nature communication paper one thing that emerged is that nppt so the enzyme that is involved in in the nad savage pathway muscle is actually also declining in humans with and so what you can what we are speculating is that actually the other n precursors like nicotinic acid trion and r and& m which do not require an npt may actually be important in this case to be reused also in the context so that's why i think there more to be done but the preclinical evidence link to the clinical evidence that we see average pathway i don't think it kind of goes in the direction that it would be bad for you if you have i trigg that is going to be bad for your kidneys at least yeah well yeah so could it be that um in ckd patients the uh there's increased nad degradation via c cd38 and then cd38 i oh yeah and then cd38 is degrading nad into uh niacinamide and then that could be potentially converted into trigonelline as it's only two steps away n into na and then na into trigonelline so that could potentially explain the increase in ckd but that like as you mentioned that adding trigonelline in that equation improves the outcomes i mean but but then it doesn't really get at the root of why would nad be degraded i i'd imagine it probably wouldn't be as optimal as getting it at the root of that but along those lines too as i also mentioned in in email that centenarians there's a study that uh in the supplementary date yeah trigonelline is higher in the centenarians compared to the offspring so is that a kidney function story is it a longevity story so yeah exactly i tried to look up at that study the thing that i'm missing from that study though is that they don't when they selected their patients the only thing they said is that they were these patients were relatively healthy so they excluded people with the with you know age associated diseases so no cancer no dementia no i guess also no chronic kidney disease which means that in this case you know we cannot let's say extrapolate to k let's say we should assume that probably kidney or gfr in that case is still within the normal range for for that age so in that sense i think then my feeling is that that would be due to the fact that perhaps there is a positive association with having a trigonelline and being more let's say long lived or or healthy liv you know in that sense so that would be my conclusion based on the fact that they excluded patients with ckd in that sense but yes i mean having that information on gfr for instance would have been interesting to see if there would have been any correlation there yeah and then uh do you uh do things in your diet or i don't think it's even sold as a supplement um yeah camera it's crazy yeah it's crazy myera let's try again yeah some i don't know why it was working perfectly now all right sorry about that you're in the future that's the that's the future yeah maybe sorry maybe yeah i don't know what happened my computer is going a bit crazy okay for maybe i'll leave it a bit like this for a moment but just a couple more question ah it's still there so um what did i have i just had uh one more i had man diet got s distracted you sorry about that no worries no worries um ah so right so you're in your own personal approach i don't think that chanelling is sold as a supplement i looked oh yeah yeah so yeah go ahead go ah do you do anything specifically to try to boost dietary intake or uh what would you suggest or or are there ways that we can do that yeah so well i wish that would be the easy way to say just drinking more coffee i mean i love coffee i mean i drink a lot of coffee but the thing is just through let's say diet is going to be quite difficult in sense yes combining different things in diet i mean let's say either legumes or veggies with high concentrations of trional like fog seeds for instance and so on or drinking coffee could be let's say certainly we should increase regonal to a point i mean just drinking three to four cups per day i think there's a study from norway where they actually use trigonelline as a biomarker for coffee exposure i mean for how much coffee you drink it turns out that the more coffee you drink the more trion you get in plasma but even drinking three to four cups only leads you to like something like 8 to 10 microl of trigonelline in plasma which may be not sufficient for let's say modulating n values and so in terms of supplementation yeah that that's the thing i mean again this is a new let's say relatively new molecule so on the market there is literally nothing as pure trigonelline at the moment there is a lot of things like you know some people buy also for let's say muscle an aniz things you know they they buy fenric seed extracts um which can be either powder or sold as essentially as encapsulated in pills the problem with the fenri extracts is that they are not generally they are not standardized by the amount of trigell so they are they can be very diverse you know depending on the supplier they will be very diverse on the amount of trigonal so there is some reports in literature that say that wild fenre in in india or something has up to 12% trion meaning that you would still need to take something like 13 or more grams um of that of the wall extract in order to have something that is equivalent to what we see mice for trigonelline so because you would need approximately something like 1.7 1.8 grams of trigonelline to see with what we use in m to cnad right but you know eating 13 15 grams of an extract that has a lot of other molecules there and we do not know whether that will be positive for your health you know it's probably not advisable especially not knowing much more at the clinical level so yeah i would say eating a good diet with lots of veggies or legumes that contain trional is away and drinking coffee actually the caffeinated coffee still contains trigonelline so it's also okay that's great all right uh so i can't see your face but thanks fenzo that was fantastic uh and then i'm sure got the no worries no worries so i'm looking forward to the paper and uh i'm sure we'll talk soon yeah thank you thank you again michael yeah bye
