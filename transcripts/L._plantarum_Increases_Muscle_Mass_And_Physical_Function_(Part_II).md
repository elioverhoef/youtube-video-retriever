Can probiotic bacteria improve muscle mass and physical function in the last video we saw that isolation followed by transplantation of l plantarum from the poop of olympic weightlifter singh chong quo increased muscle mass and physical function in young mice now a different strain of l plantarum is also present in taiwanese pickle cabbage which then raises a couple of questions can fermented cabbages survived l plantarum similarly impact muscle in young mice but also in aged and also can fermented cabbage derived l plantarum impact muscle in people and more specifically in randomized control trials or rcts so to address that first let's have a look at the data in young mice where el plantarum was isolated from taiwanese pickled cabbage and then transplanted into both young and aged mice and this was an eight-week study so did a non-poop-derived l plantarum strain improve muscle strength so that's we can see here grip strength on the y-axis apply against time so weeks here will be baseline before transplantation of el planetarium and then weeks four and eight are four and eight weeks after transplantation into both young and old mice so starting with the data at baseline we can see that there are four groups why control as shown there in purple so young control young twk 10 that's the strain of l plantarum isolated from taiwanese pickle cabbage that was used a control which are the aged mice controls not supplemented and then aged twk-10 aged my supplemented with uh or that were going to be supplemented with l plantarum now before even looking at these supplemented versus non-supplement non-supplemented data as a function of time we can see that aged mice have a worse grip strength or worse muscle strength when compared with young and this isn't any any big news this just demonstrates the age-related decline for muscle strength which is well well documented in many studies so what was the effect of l plantarum at four and eight weeks after starting supplementation so for both young and aged mice both at the four and eight week time point we can see an improvement for grip strength in the l plantarium supplemented mice so clearly we can see that muscle strength was improved in both young and aged mice so what about muscle mass so here we're looking at relative muscle weight which is muscle mass divided by body weight for both young and aged mice and then we've got two groups control and the l plantarum group twk-10 but unlike the data for grip strength here we see that l plantarum did not affect relative muscle weight or muscle mass divided by body weight in either young or aged mice so together from this study we can see that there was improved muscle strength but not muscle mass in el planetarium supplemented young and aged mice so does l plantarum supplementation improve muscle mass and or physical function in people so to address that first we're going to have a look at this study and all the studies referenced in this video will be in the video's description so if you're interested in that check it out so in this study they looked at the effect of l plantarum supplementation in healthy humans so let's just define that more appropriately so we can see whom these data may generally apply so in this study it included both men and women with relatively small amounts of men and women within each group so you can see that within each of these three groups there were nine subjects per group both men and women so 18 in the placebo 18 people in the low dose and 18 people in the high dose of l plantarum supplementation so in terms of how much the actual supplementation was in the l plantarum groups you can see that for the 1x group it was 3 times 10 to the 10 colony forming units cfus of l plantarum per day and for the 3x group it was 9 times 10 to the 10th and note that these are both higher doses for the human study relative to the mouse studies so then in terms of age these were young adults as you can see by the average ages within each group they were within the 21 to 23 year old range in terms of bmi the these subjects were already relatively lean which is a defined as a bmi less than 25 kilograms per meter squared for all of the groups except for the 3x l plantar group as you can see by that red arrow and then in terms of cardiovascular fitness all of these subjects were relatively cardiovascular fit as indicated by vo2 max for the men we can see that they had average values approaching 50 and for women we can see average values around 45. So what was the effect of l plantarum supplementation for six weeks on muscle mass and function so first let's start with the muscle mass change or muscle weight change as shown here and then muscle muscle mass was measured by bia or bioelectric impedance analysis as shown with the device there that's the actual device that they used and then in terms of we've our three groups placebo low and high dose l plantarum we can see that muscle weight was increased significantly increased only for the highest dose of el plantarum as shown by the green arrow now note that bia also measures fat mass and interestingly body fat percentage or bf percentage was also impacted which is what we can see here so the body fat change percentage on the y-axis plotted against our three groups and once again we can see an alteration for body composition more specifically the percent body fat change for the highest dose of l plantarum which there was a reduction for the body fat percentage and the highest dose of l planetarium supplementation so from these two figures we can see that there was increased lean mass as a measure of muscle mass a decreased percentage of body fat in young people supplemented with l plantarum now it's important to note or ask the question are these data confounded by weight loss or diet changes because if you lose weight one would expect a reduction in the percentage of body fat or if you alter your diet it's possible to see changes in the amount of muscle mass so without showing the data but actually just saying what what they showed calorie protein fat and carb intake were not different when compared with baseline for any of the three groups and also body weight was not different when compared with baseline again for any of the three groups placebo or the low or high dose l plantarum groups which then highlights a potential role for el plantarum on increasing muscle mass and decreasing the percentage of body fat in the young adults of this study so what about physical function so for that in this study they looked at treadmill exhaustion time so a run to exhaustion test on the treadmill and first looking at the data for placebo we can see that that was not different when compared with baseline but then we can see for both the low and high dose l plantarum supplemented groups the treadmill exhaustion time will run to exhaustion time was significantly longer for both supplemented groups so we can see that aerobic exercise capacity is improved in young adults supplemented with l plantarum now just as a brief summary because we're about to jump into even more data in terms of l plantarum supplementation in young adults they had an increase in muscle mass and aerobic exercise capacity and a reduction for the percentage of body fat so uh studies in young adults are nice what about studies in older adults does l plantarum supplementation impact muscle mass and or physical function in older adults so for that we'll have a look at this study which looked at frail older adults so let's just define that a little bit more clearly because when i hear frail older adults i think of a severe phenotype so let's see if that was actually true or not so first we've got our three groups again placebo and then low and high dose of l plantarum for the low dose l plantarum we can say that that was 2 times 10 to the 10th colony forming units and for the high dose l plantarum that was 6 times 10 to the 10th colon forming units now note that both of these doses that were used in this study in older adults were lower than what was used in the study that i just showed for younger adults so the low dose was actually 50 lower than what was used in the earlier study and for the high dose that's 33 percent lower than when you and then what was used for the study in young adults in terms of age this study included people with average ages within each group within the 75 to about 81 year old range and then we can see a frailty score uh so about three for a frailty score for each of these three groups so what does that actually mean what are we looking at here so in this study they used a clinical frailty scale and people with a clinical frailty scale score between one to four were included so we can see that one would be very fit four would be vulnerable now the average frailty score in the study was about three which means that on average the subjects in the study were managing well so people whose medical problems were well controlled but were not regularly active between beyond routine walking in other words sedentary but uh with adequate control of their medical problems so did l plantarium supplementation for 18 weeks so this was a longer study too relative to relative to the younger uh the younger adult study that used l plantarum supplementation did that improve muscle mass and physical function in these older adults so let's start with muscle mass on the y-axis and then we've got our three groups again young uh sorry placebo low and high dose of el plantarum on the x and then we've got four time points that muscle mass was assessed so baseline six weeks 12 weeks and 18 weeks after uh starting l plantarium supplementation so first low-dose l plantarum did not affect the amount of muscle mass but then we can see small but significant increases for each of the high-dose l plantarium groups at each of the time points 6 12 and 18 weeks when compared with baseline about a one to three percent increase for muscle mass now muscle mass can go a correspondingly go with an increase in body weight so you don't necessarily improve body composition if that's the case so to address that the authors of the study looked at relative muscle weight or the relative muscle weight percentage which is the muscle mass divided by body weight times a hundred and when doing that once again we see that the low dose l plantarum group was not significant in terms of the change in the relative muscle weight percentage but there was one time point where it was significant for the high dose l plantarum supplemented group about a three percent increase and only at 18 weeks so we can see that the 6 and 12 week changes for only looking at muscle mass now are non-significant when accounting for body weight using the relative muscle weight percentage so together from these two figures we can see a small but significant increase for muscle mass in l plantarum more specifically the high dose only supplemented older adults now also note that unlike the randomized control trial in young people the body fat percentage was not different for any of the l plantarum supplemented groups both the low and high dose in older adults so what was the effect of l plantarum supplementation on physical function so for that i'm going to show four functional measures first we'll start with grip strength we've got data for the right hand and then data for the left hand so starting with the data for the right hand we can see that grip strength was not significantly increased in either of the l plantarum groups and then when looking at the left hand we can see that the low dose group did not have a significant improvement for grip strength but at 18 weeks there was a 13 significant increase for grip strength for the highest l plantarum supplemented group now i find this data a little bit curious how can you improve grip strength in one hand but not the other i'd expect it to be in both hands or or none so i i find this data maybe a little bit suspect but nonetheless the study reported increased muscle strength only for the left hand in in the high dose l plantarium supplemented older adults so what about lower body strength in or endurance did l plantarium supplementation impact those measures so in terms of lower body strength slash endurance they use a 30-second chair stand test which basically is how many chair stands can you do from standing from sitting down to standing up and then sitting back down again in 30 seconds so we've got our three groups low placebo low and high dose l plantarum and then here we can see that at both 12 weeks and 18 weeks l plantarium supplementation or the number of chair stands at 12 and 18 weeks was significantly increased for both low and high dose l plantarum so what about measures of mobility balance and or gait so for that we'll take a look at two different measures first starting with the three meter timed up and go and that test that's where you stand up from a chair walk three meters and then sit back down and abbreviate it it's the three meter 3m tug so first we can see that placebo got significantly worse at performing this test over each of the time points so 6 12 and 18 weeks after the baseline visit and then there was no effect for the three meter times up and go for the low dose supplemented group but then there was a significant improvement at 18 weeks for a faster three meter timed up and go for the high-dose l plantarium group so what about the 10 meter walk test so how fast are you able to walk 10 meters and once again we can see that placebo got worse over the course of the 18-week study whereas the low dose low-dose l plantarium supplemented group had a faster 10 meter walk again at the 18 18 week time point but interestingly high dose alpineter did not see an improvement for this test so if alpine camera was maybe there's a sweet spot of supplementation or um maybe it's not a real effect i don't know but they did see a significant difference for at least for the low uh l plantarium supplementing group for the 10 meter walk test in this study all right so we just went through a lot of data let's just summarize it including the data from the last video so first l plantarum transmutation from an olympic weight lifter improved muscle mass and physical function in young mice and that was again in the in the last video and then for the three studies in this video uh using uh l plantarum isolated from fermented cabbage first data in mice both young and old we saw improved muscle strength but not muscle mass and then when looking at the two rcts first in young adults there was an increase from muscle mass and aerobic exercise capacity and for the study in older adults there were small but significant improvements from muscle mass and physical function so that's all for now uh if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and uh before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links
