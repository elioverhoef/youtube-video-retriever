Hey everyone uh today we've got chris man lumis on again today for round three of our conquer aging or die trying and unaging doccom chris's website podcast so today's agenda will focus almost exclusively on exercise starting with chris's marathon training and then cardiovascular fitness metrics and a whole bunch of other stuff so what have we got let's uh start it off chris and welcome okay thanks it's great to be here glad to be on the podcast again so uh as we talked about in the previous one um uh i've delivered on my threat of uh running a marathon um so i i did quite a bit of preparation for it um i went through a 16-week training uh in order to get myself in shape and and i was already doing some exercise so i i thought the first thing uh that it would be interesting to talk about today would be how i designed um based off of my research the overall program that i used for the marathon training and and uh eventually get to how the marathon actually turned out so um when i started doing research initially on longevity and the best way to live as long as possible i came across the um governmental recommendation that you should exercise for around uh 150 minutes per week and um i always found that to be kind of very vague um it sort of felt like they were saying well it's a really good idea if you want to live a long time that you should eat food and we recommend you should at least eat 2,000 calories worth of food because people who only eat 1,500 calories with the food don't live as long right it's very um kind of general and as i looked at the specific sports you could do i found the same kind of generality it wasn't really clear that just more was better some sports if you did more of them you didn't get the benefit as much and some you did and it didn't even seem like it had a pattern so i decided to simplify that and look at what i considered to be the most um pure form of exercise which is straight up running or jogging and the studies on that are fairly clear um they show that um uh they're fairly clear and unanimous but in a surprising result so let me uh bring that up so basically if you look at the the exercise of what you get when you run um the running uh studies generally show that if you run on a weekly basis at all for at least 15 minutes or so once a week then you can see that very quickly you get a reduction in your all cause mortality this is a reduction in your premature death hang on chris share screen share screen because i don't i don't see it on my end thanks okay there we go okay so um if you look at this chart this is showing the uh hazard ratios of all cause mortality and basically it's showing you how much it's reducing premature death by um so uh basically as you look at this as i was saying you can see that as long as you're doing at least some exercise on a weekly basis or more you have about the same 40% reduction so 6 uh hazard ratio for premature death so that seems to be consistent whether you're doing exercise once or twice a week all the way up to over six times per week and as for the speed as well if even if you're just doing a light jog at less than 6 miles hour or if you're going over 7.6 miles per hour again it seems that once you've started doing any exercise you're as long as you're not in the non-runner uh area whatever quintile you're in you get about the same benefit out of it and this this um uh confused me quite a bit like i had uh seen other people and we'll talk about it a little bit more later who said that basically the fitter you are the longer you're going to live and it's counterintuitive that even if you run more you're basically not going to get any additional longevity out of it and um i puzzled over this for a long time trying to see okay what what is the how do these two things fit together how can i make a a complete image out of this and um taking a look at sort of the speed that you run at like i thought that basically the faster you ran the more fit you would be and therefore the longer that you' live i came across um some a study specifically on mitochondria and how it adapts to exercise so here's one of the uh important tables from that study and this is talking about um basically the increase that you get in mitochondria from different um exercise intensities from uh bicycling or running wait just just so i can add a little bit of context so cs is cs is citrate synthes that's a protein lo localized specifically to mitochondria so if you have lots of citrate synthes cs activity that's a marker of mitochondrial mass so sorry exactly right so this is showing basically how much your u mitochondria is increasing so and to even take another step back mitochondria is a small organel that's in all of your cells and it's where all pretty much all of the energy of the body comes from so any increase or benefit that you're getting from increased uh um aerobic fitness is coming from increased mitochondria um that then gives you the ability to um create more energy so um as you look at this though on the bottom we have the relative exercise intensity and you can see that from a relative exercise intensity of even of 40% all the way up to 100% basically there's no increase in the amount of cs activity or mitochondria creation so this is saying that it doesn't matter whether you're going uh very hard and going at say 80% of your maximum heart rate or whether you're going at say 60% it doesn't increase the mitochondria that much more comparatively for the overall time so there's a weak weak spot in that only focusing on the cs activity so that that would be an indicator of mitochondria number assuming that cs activity is proportional to mitochondrial number but it's not a measure of mitochondrial efficiency how well or how poor are mitochondria mitochondria able to convert you know uh uh um nad nadh and fadh into energy right you're you're ahead of the script there mike unsurprisingly so let me uh let me uh i'll catch to that in a minute uh let me jump to the uh the next uh the next table from that or chart from that same study so the next thing that it does is it takes the um cs activity and now it uh sees how it varies compared to an arbitrary unit training volume in an arbitrary unit and to clarify what this arbitrary unit is basically they take the um total time uh that you spend in total number of weeks um and they multiply that by the number of minutes per time and then they further multiply that by uh the uh training volume of the intensity that we saw in the previous slide so if you were training at say 60% um then you wouldn't be training uh wouldn't be getting as much cs activity as if you were training at 90% but if you were training um longer at 60% you might get even more cs activity and as you can see from the the chart here basically it's linear like um basically the more total training volume you put in the more mitochondria that you develop over that time so this is saying that um basically the difference between say running three times a week versus running once a week is that either one of them will steadily increase your number of mitochondria or your overall fitness but running three times a week will'll do it three times as fast but eventually in either way within a year or so you're going to come to the the maximum amount of mitochondria that your body will sustain so this then is answering the question of why does it not matter whether you run five times a week or once a week as long as you're running consistently every week the long term you're going to hit the maximum that you can within a year or so actually probably quite a bit less than that so it's more about the consistency as opposed to the intensity and as long as you're continuing to go so there's another variable here too to square the to square the circle is there published data on uh citrate synthes cs activity and all cause mortality risk so uh citrate syes activity basically the number mitochondria is about 90 % uh correlated with v2 max so um this is sort of a it's a secondary thing so we're looking at how then it's related to the mitochondria itself but um it's highly correlated with your overall ability to create energy and your cardiorespiratory fitness cool so um i haven't got a direct cs activity to mortality but a 90% correlation between this and v2 max and as we know there are studies that talk about v2 max and mortality yes okay so to come back to your other point the next table from this same study that's talking about mitochondrial activity now we're talking about the maximum mass specific respiration which is a is a honestly is a a label that every time i read the study i've got to think over it again to figure out what it's mean what it means but basically this is talking about what you just said mike this is talking about the efficiency of each mitochondria so as you increase the number of mitochondria um you increase your overall ability to handle uh to create energy in each of your cells but there's another measure here which is to say how efficient each mitochondria is the mitochondria actually have a very short lifespan within the cells it's between 3 to 10 days halflife so they're continually being decommissioned and recreated over time and many of them can can uh lose efficiency um just like your car wears out the mitochondria even though they have a short lifespan event al lose efficiency but if you push yourself really hard then you increase the efficiency of the mitochondria you have as well as increasing the number and so this table is showing you the the efficiency of the mitochondria and we have moderate intensity continuous training this is just a steady state aerobic run say jogging at a steady pace high-intensity interval training where you're running full out and then doing a low jog or low exercise and then running full out again and doing that in several cycles um mixed where you're doing both moderate and high intensity and sit which you might not hear as often um stands for sprint interval training uh which is kind of a funny kind of training where you basically sprint for 20 to 30 seconds at over 100% of what you could sustain because it's only a sprint and then you just sit down and then you do it again so as you look at this you can see that the sit um the sprint interval training gives you the most benefit as far as efficiency but the trade-off of this is is that because it's a maximum speed sprint faster than you can maintain even for a minute it's very difficult to get the volume of this so you can see that the next group here is combined between high-intensity interval training and mixed basically you need to do high-intensive ral training this is at about uh 90% of your maximum heart rate or more in order to get a significant increase in the efficiency of your um mitochondria so now with these things put together i have a better idea of sort of what are the components when they say get 150 minutes of exercise a week i can more precisely say you should be getting certain components and those components will grow basically linearly over time until you hit 100% so putting those together i then went and s looked for a training program that would basically go off of the specific components of what i wanted to train for the marathon so for this i then went for a mixed component where i had one component was high-intensity interval training so i'd increased the efficiency of my mitochondria another one that would go for basically the moderate intensity where i'd be increasing the total number of mitochondria that i have and then a third one that would treat me what sort of is a tempo pace what it is like to do a faster pace like i would do in the actual marathon itself so the less is more training um which has been done by the ferman institute has exactly that it's about half the volume of most marathon training programs but basically every week you do one of each of those runs you do a long run long slow distance run which is going to be over 16 to 32 kilometers or 10 to 20 miles and then you do another um speed work which is my high-intensity interval training um which i was already doing so i continued doing that basically as i was before and then one more which is then the speed run where you're doing tempo work and that's going to be between 5 and 15 kilm or between 3 and 10 miles and that would be done basically as fast as you can so but doing these each of these every week i i wanted to know how was i doing against my goal i wanted to run the marathon in less than three and a half hours and this this uh time uh target was uh given to me in a way because i had gone and done a v2 max test um the full test where you're on a treadmill and they put a mask on your face and they tie you to the ceiling in case you fall so you don't fall on the ground when you're going at maximum speed and uh ran on that and they gave me a full accounting of what my v2 my um the maximum amount of oxygen i could process per minute was and they gave me an estimate based off of my stats they said you have a vo2 max of 55 was quite proud that's about 1 in 50 uh level v2 max and said we think you could run a marathon in 3 hours and 36 minutes okay um at the time i said great now i'm not going to run one but it turns out that i was going to run one so um setting three hour three and a half hours and i wanted to see how i was doing against that so i use regal's formula which is a formula that given a certain distance and speed will then estimate how long you could do a longer or shorter distance for um and use that then to estimate how long it would take me to run the various distances and plotted that out every every week so here's the here's what it looks like for my uh test for that and so this is then uh my estimate for each of the 16 weeks of how long i was projected to finish the marathon in so you can see at the beginning i was um for my tempo runs i was mored around 3 hours and 40 minutes and then over time i was able to improve my speeds uh until at the end i was more under 3 hours and 20 minutes or so um likewise my long slow distance runs the one where i was uh running up to 10 uh up to 20 miles uh distance also improved over time and my high-intensity interval training my fastest speed actually uh had the biggest gain um until i was almost looking like i was going to run in three hours but of course a marathon is very different than running two minutes at your maximum speed so i i generally looked at my tempo run as the most reliable for this um and this gave me a good feeling for that i was improving i improved about 1% every week for the first uh 10 weeks and then i think i kind of plateaued after that it didn't see as much benefit but uh 10 1% is about 2 minutes off of my marathon time so it's uh quite material took around 20 minutes off or so from the 340 down to the 320 level so then um the last hurdle that i had as i was getting ready for the marathon is that um marathons are are hard uh it uh to run a marathon um even in the practicing for the marathon you might have noticed that in the distances that i talked about a marathon is 42 kilometers or 26 miles you never run that distance when you're training for a marathon uh which i found to be kind of surprising because it's so long um it's quite exhausting in on the body such that if you were to run that during these 16 weeks you would basically throw yourself out um of being able to train for the next week or two which is not okay when you only have six weeks to practice in so i knew that going into the marathon was going to be harder than any distance i had run in the meantime because i was able to run those distance and yet keep on doing the other training so i started to do research on what it is that uh you meet in that last 10 kilometers so the last um four miles of the marathon and if you've talked to someone who's done a marathon or done a marathon yourself you might be familiar with the hitting the wall or bonking and uh this is where basically you've run say three quarters of the marathon and then all of a sudden you just feel like you you just can't go any further and this is where people talk about dropping out of warp all of a sudden they just need to walk they can't they can't keep up the pace that they've been able to hold for the entire time or that they did during their training so i did quite a bit of research on this to see what is the cause of this and how do i avoid doing this when i will never have run a marathon before i actually ran the marathon and i came across this study that shows um basically the scientific approach is what they call it uh compared with freestyle so this is the running velocity that people were able to maintain in each section of the marathon so this is the first 5 km the second five all the way up to the last 40 to 42 kilom and um the scientific approach is saigh and the uh freestyle do it as you will is the free and you can see that the scientific approach is able to basically keep the same pace almost through the entire 42 kilometers whereas the freestyle uh loses quite a bit after the 30th kilometer so what's the difference uh between these two approaches um the answer is that the scientific approach is taking a lot of calories during the race itself the marathon takes over two around 2,000 calories just to run that distance and basically people in their stores and their body stores will have around um 30 kilometers or so of energy that they can travel and so it's after that 30th kilometer that you really start to feel like you just don't have the energy to carry on wait quick injection so because you you should be at fat burning throughout the majority after the first five minutes or so of running the marathon uh you get a you get an increase in um uh glycogen breakdown after the beginning of so your gl blood glucose levels spike and then as you continue it during your aerobic run um and shift to fat burning then glucose levels start to come down you start to deplete your glycogen stores in both your muscle and your liver and then when they get low enough i mean you could have all the fat in the world to burn off but the fact is if your uh glucose levels uh fall below a certain point in the blood i don't know if it's 40 mill milligrams per deciliter but when they get very low and you just you your body can't uh sustain glucose output versus how much glycogen and complete glycogen depletion now you're completely fried you're you're done you're finished i mean you're you're you basically just lay on the floor you can't do anything until you get until you until you restore your you know blood uh and glycogen levels yep yeah and you can see these people like uh in the freestyle here you can see after the 30th kilometer they're basically done they're hitting the floor so they uh finished on average 10 minutes slower uh than the the scientific approach where they were taking gels and um this is not talking about getting a banana at the 20th kilometer um i had a practically a bandelier of gels that i ran with so i had 10 packets of 100 calories i went into the race with an extra thousand calories uh sorry uh yeah th000 calories in gel as i ran it and every four kilometers i would be taking another gel um there can be some uh indigestion uh issues with the marathons uh but the studies show that basically the increased gel doesn't make that any worse so while that might be an issue for some people you still better to take the gels and avoid bonking the wall than to try and not take them um in fact i felt this around kilometer 20 i started to feel a little uneasy i'm like okay my stomach feels a little queasy am i gonna have stomach issues and then i slammed on another gel it seemed to be fine and carried on um i was able to carry on straight through to the 40th kilometer i think i dropped from a 4 45 minutes per kilometer to a 5 minutes per kilometer rate i lost uh maybe 20 or 30 seconds on my overall time due to a slight drop in pace but nowhere near the 10 minutes that i would have hit if i'd hit the wall um another comment or related topic to this is car looing um you might have heard this before from marathoners that before they go on a race that they spend um time eating lots of pasta and things um i found a study that talked about this with cyclists and they broke the cyclists into four groups and the slowest group was the group that uh went on a long endurance cycle and uh they had no breakfast and no uh calories or gels during the race and they did the worst uh the next group was the group that had breakfast but no gels or calories during the race they did the next best and then we had a tie between the two groups that either had gels during the race did the best regardless of whether they had breakfast or not so more so than trying to eat calories in advance of the marathon it's important to actually take the calories during the marathon and about a thousand or more in order to get yourself across smi in line not just all calories but sugar in this case you need sugar to replenish what your body can't pump out yeah you wouldn't be able to digest the fat fast enough correct yeah yeah and plus it would weigh you down the digestion you don't want to digest when you're actively you know the the energy should be directed towards your muscles not towards digestion in that case exactly so uh with this um in my training i went in for another v2 max test um the week before my marathon and uh they said that thanks to my training my v2 max had gone up to 61.5 um uh which is quite uh surprising even for me that puts me at about one in 300 people by age um and uh was able to finish it not within the the um three hours and 20 minutes that i had hoped for but within a respectable 3 hours and 26 minutes uh breaking uh the three and a half hours that i wanted to putting me just a minute and a half short of qualifying for the boston marathon but that's okay i don't i don't have any plans to go to the boston that at this time so so wait so wait so uh so i have a whole bunch of questions uh go ahead it sounds like you're gonna do marathon training again true or false i think at this point no plans no so i appreci so the datadriven uh scientific approach for how to even go about marathon training fantastic so it seems like that process was more exciting for you than the actual process of running the marathon itself yeah the marathon it's i mean it is anyone who's run it will tell you it's it's it's very brutal i was out for a full two or three weeks afterwards so after i completed the marathon coming off of it uh there was um i i got a hotel right next to the finish line and uh so i only had to go maybe maybe a 100 meters or so but within that 100 meters in order to cross over a bridge that was over a river i had to go up three steps three stairs it was that that was almost as hard as the marathon like i mean it just that kind of like at that point i was all the adrenaline was gone of trying to do the thing and just trying to climb with those three steps i was i was severely disabled for weeks afterwards um still great still great data v2 max 50 would you say 55 before 63 i mean still fantastic data so yeah 61.5 afterwards oh 61.5 yeah fantastic so yeah congrats on that thanks yeah it um it had uh it had bad effects on my blood work and my liver enzymes um i think i've seen this on one of the uh patreon discussions in your patreon actually someone else mentioned yeah when i trained for marathon all of my uh liver enzymes alt a ggt also actually go way over the reasonable bounds how soon how soon after uh the marathon did you blood test that was actually um in the middle of the of the 16 weeks of training oh wow yeah well that's just muscle so the alt uh can come from the muscle too so some of that's muscle damage chronic muscle damage ggt should be liver too but yeah that's uh yeah so then uh testosterone was below bound uh for me which is atypical when i've had it tested before it was fine so again the pressure of my body total total total testosterone or free free oh okay yep shbg did you measure shbg in the no just free testosterone yeah and then also i had a heart uh stress indicator which told me my heart was stressed yes yeah correct um but i got the liver ends imes done actually just a month after the marathon and all were back within normal ranges but the your training volume probably how how much did you cut your training volume down to oh right back to baseline um so um and that's after actually for the two or three weeks where i couldn't train at all i was too um too exhausted i i had trouble sleeping after that because my knees were so painful they were fine during the marathon but just the the stress on them was so uh difficult for several days afterward yeah now imagine that you your your knees and hip joint and ankles adapt to that stress in the short term and then you're like i'm going to do another one and then how many years of that pounding can you take before there's hip replacement kne replacement i'm not trying to go down down that road so what's your training volume now no running at all or what's no i'm back to straight hit um so i'll do about uh two session two half hour long sessions of high-intensity interval training um a week and uh am just working from that my my v2 max this is not a full test because i i don't have a mask on my face nor am i tied to the ceiling um just using my apple watch though um my my v2 max is still significantly higher than it was when i started it's at 53 according to my watch um there's a gap of about 10 points between actual and watch so i keep seeing uh like these 70-year-old athletes on my timeline on social media and uh like running you know 100 meter dash and stuff like that and just looking fantastic so i've got visions of getting back into hit once i've got the the freedom of you know freedom of scheduling not just that recommend it yeah i'm a big fan of sprints uh so even weighted weighted hit you know so putting on a weight fest or some ankle weights and running it with you know because it's it's you can you can put resistance on it and improve your speed so that's how i how i would do it yeah um jump rope uh bicycle yeah i mean it's there's a there's a lot of variation that you can do that to find something that works for you cuz that would be the cardiovascular benefit but the actual sprint you have you have to get the leg you have to you've got to get the hip extensors you know you've got because you're lifting your legs right it's a power rather than just you know i'm jumping up and down and it's just plant reflection it's just your ankles right so there are more muscle groups and hip hip hip stuff that you need you know so well i do i do remember that um you get a higher v2 max um measurement from running than you do on a bicycle about 10 to 15% more if i remember right so that's what you're talking about more act um activation yeah right um with uh just basic running things than you would with uh sort of sitting on a bicycle for example where you're using legs intensively but maybe less so of the upper body but you're sitting too so you don't have to hold the full body weight in that in that case yeah all right so should we go through your data yes ab absolutely what have you got what can you tell me yeah let's see let's see hang on share okay so we'll start with uh sleep right so for for those who don't know chris tracked his data um resting heart rate heart rate variability slow wave sleep total sleep all the things that whoop provides this isn't a whoop specific thing it's just what chris war i mean you could generate these data with b basically any weable apple watch ora so not here to promote whoop that's not the goal uh so when was your marathon training during which months um it would have been through like november 8th through to february 25th ah so can you see can you see uh what i've got the uh yeah yeah okay there we go increasing it decreasing it okay so um so it's this whole period then is is the marathon training yep ah okay all right so un it starts out lighter so yep go ahead i was just going to say unfortunately there's no before you know the femon period before but it's still okay i mean you can pretty much see that your your slow wave sleep percentage so that's your uh deep sleep for those who don't know deep sleep divided by total sleep multiplied by 100 uh it decreases during aging as shown here this is a meta analysis of 65 studies slow wave sleep percentage on the y axis plotted against age from basically 5year olds to 90y olds and in youth extreme youth well i don't want to say extreme youth but very young um you can see that it's about 25% slow wave sleep percentage is about 25% and then for someone who's around 90 granted it's extrapolation based on one point but if you go to someone in their 80s it's somewhere around 8% of total sleep time and that's potentially important because slow slow wave sleep uh again deep sleep is linked with uh alzheimer's disease risk so we want to avoid this age related decline so during your marathon training there wasn't any severe reduction for your percentage of slow wave sleep which is good news because if uh you know marathon training starts to me mess with slow wave sleep sure you get the cardiovascular health benefits or potentially right but maybe you're increasing risk other places so you can see it was around uh 18.3% to a high of 21% so what i did was i highlighted that range so and again i don't know where your data is now or where it was before but at least for the marathon training period i mean it's it's better than expected you know the trend line uh based on your chronological age so you you'd be somewhere somewhere you know here in this range 15 to a 35 year old which is pretty good news it's great yeah yeah all right and then also oh i was just going to say also that last week um up until the last month the february month uh is probably actually the best baseline representation because there's about a 3 week um reduction in overall intensity um so that's sort of um why i think that because is you're getting ready well there's the marathon which is one intense thing overall my training volume was decreasing uh as i went through the month of february so i had the benefits of the increased health from having done the the previous uh 12 weeks um that's probably why that was my highest yeah did you track training volume in terms of uh either steps or oh actually even the i could i could i could look at a correlation for the average daily heart rate as a metric of you know how active you were on that day against slow wave sleep and we could test the correlation you know is is the uh d loading in february associated with um you know your your your your training volume right yeah but that would be for another day that's i didn't do that a prior all right so then so another important metric to consider is the nighttime respiratory rate which is how many breaths per minute do you take while asleep and there isn't much published data on that in terms of all cause mortality risk but there is this one study granted it's in i believe this is these are two different cohorts this one is in 70ish year olds and this one's in about 80 year olds uh so we've got um how many people died the rate mortality uh percentage and then their followup starting from their initial assessment of their nighttime sleeping respiratory rate and for people who had a respiratory rate that was uh less than 16 beats per minute in green in both studies they had a lower risk of death for all causes compared to greater than 16 now could these values be lower as with in relation to mortality cut points at younger ages i mean there's just no published data this this study was published two or three years ago and there hadn't been any follow-ups in other age groups so um hopefully that'll get published at some point so your respiratory rate comparatively is good with a 16 cut off 16 breaths per minute cut off you're you know consistently lower than that so fantastic news on the nighttime respiratory rate right did they did they give a a reduction like any um hazard risk ratio for that or an estimate based off of the increase more um or longevity i'd have to look at look at the study i didn't i i don't remember off the top of my head but we can post a study in the you know and i i can send you the study and you know okay yeah you can i don't i don't have it mastered you know memorized off the top of my there's only so much volume that the brain you know the lust garden brain all right so then heart rate variability resting heart rate changes over that five monon period and what's interesting is is with the increase in volume and training volume and even decrease in training volume there weren't any major shifts in your heart rate variability uh and even resting heart rate as you'll see um which could suggest overtraining i mean i'd imagine that as your training volume increases you know you potentially find an upper limit where where your body wouldn't be able to adapt beyond in my case that that's true unfortunately for me a gorilla mindset but physiology that's like no that's too much enough these data start to suffer in your case that doesn't seem to be the case is it's pretty close to a tight range i've seen data you know where heart rate variability will tank into the 30s and then other months it'll be a little bit higher you know in the 60s that's not at all true in your case so in terms of this range um you i i've got highlighted here so based on chronological ag and this study included i think nine or eight million people um looking at the uh the same whoop metric that provides hrv uh uh what is it root mean squared of su successive differences that's the ve that's the heart rate variability measure that woop provides but using your range uh you'd be above the median at any chronological age up until around 30 to 35 years but you could be within you know the the wide range for basically every age group so it's hard to say is this youthful you know uh but it's definitely better you know than age expected you know age expected would be somewhere around 40 uh so throughout the whole period you're above that which is good news yeah there's a there's a lot of variability in that um i mean those are the monthly averages right um on some days i had heart rate variability over a hundred um and then after the tempo runs or some of the other things sometimes it would be it would be like i always when i had the inversion where my resting heart rate is higher than my heart rate variability i'm like okay that was a that was a bit of a tough workout there um the other thing that makes my heart rate variability um perhaps confounds it is that uh i do go out drinking on the weekend so i'll have maybe five drinks on the weekend and that was one of the number one things i found would just tank my heart rate variability i consider that to be and i have no studies or science to back this up i consider that to be superficial like um if i went on a long run and my heart rate variability was low and i tried to run the next day i would feel tired and not quite up but if i went out with my friends and had um two pints um i wouldn't notice the next day that i was particularly put out by it or overly stressed so um that's a bit trickier um and it's one of the things why i'm so impressed with your ability to precisely track the heart rate variability every day and try and move the numbers up wait so there are a couple of factors going on there one is when considering that you had days of very high heart rate variability and days of very high resting heart rate which for those who don't know that's well very high heart rate variability would be good but in the context of a higher resting heart rate that's going in the wrong direction but that your your data was able to stay pretty tight month to month that's that shows that you are able to manage um you know the chronic overtraining phenotype so so if you're after you know the the long one of the harder days or high volume days if your heart rate variability was lower and you saw that then you're like all right maybe i've got to do the tempo day or or you basically managed it well enough so that uh you didn't push the needle to the point of the overtrained phenotype being a lower heart rate variability and the higher uh heart arresting heart rate so you did a great job of managing it there i mean that's not that's not an easy thing for most people to to to manage you know and i'm not sure if you did that on purpose or just by feel uh but it's um uh it's it's not uh cleverness on my part aside from the fact that i deliberately chose a training plan that had a lower volume than most marathon training plans so standard marathon training plan will say you should go run six days out of the week um and some of those are kind of casual ones whatever but they uh would have at least twice the volume of what i did so that gave me the time then to have my hrv recover back to its height and my resting heart rate to sink down so as a result of sort of the lower um than common practice amount of volume that i did for my running i think that's what gave um why you don't see sort of my heart rate variability dying as the int as the intensity of the exercise went up because it was only until january um the end of january beginning of february that i was starting to do the really long runs where i do like a 16 kilometer full speed pace tempo pace or a 32 or 20 mile 32 km 20 mile run uh all at once that i started to put the pressure on but because the volume overall i had i had rest days i was only doing three days a week and i think that's as opposed to any clever scheduling probably what enabled my hrv to remain relatively stable uh but that is somewhat clever scheduling because you know i'm sure that there are people out there who are like i have to do this 6 days a week to run my marathon and they push themselves into that overtrained phenotype and don't actually look at the data so granted you weren't doing it on purpose but you actually were doing it on purpose right all right so then the other thing too with the with the uh two pints of uh uh whether it's alcohol right so or alcohol based stuff four standard drinks yep yeah four drinks so maybe it won't affect you as much as you know a long run with similar heart rate variability resting heart rate the next day after drinking but have you run on those days or done a workout on those days when your heart rate variabil heart rate variability is lower resting heart rate is higher as a result of alcohol the night before have you done a workout on the following day and if so was it as good as your usual performance was it harder to go through the workout on that day or or you don't notice an effect don't notice an effect huh yeah no i don't um given my uh sort of my lower volume right i mean running twice a week for half an hours uh runners would uh a serious runner would consider that not you know warmup i i don't uh i also don't have the liberty like when i have my day scheduled i'm doing my exercise that day um and then i make up for that um lack of responsiveness to the hrv by basically having kind of an overall lower volume so like i've had enough time to recover today's the day that i have to hit the gym so i go and hit the gym it's i have exactly the same mindset but wait with the alcohol in terms of after an alcohol day the next oh so you're saying after an alcohol day if the workout was scheduled for the next day you're doing you did you did it no matter what but your subjective experience of your performance during that day it nothing crazy where it's like ah this isn't a good workout for me you know it doesn't affect you you're used to it you've huh so in my case if whether it's physiological or placebo i don't know but uh i know that trying to train through you know below average whatever my 30-day average or so heart rate variability resting heart rate is it's harder for me to hit my uh rep goals for uh compound movements you know so pull-ups overhead press like things that require dedicated focus and effort so um but that's without alcohol right so but i'd imagine alcohol would make that so it's good that it hasn't negatively affected your physiology you're able to train through um so anyway all right so in terms of in terms of your resting heart rate the data is even better there um this is whoops data for for um uh age related changes in resting heart rate so average resting heart rate on the y- axis plotted against age 20 to 50 years so you'd be somewhere around here how what 51 what do you chronologically 53 53 yeah yeah yeah so you'd be off the list but uh fitbit data shows that it starts to decline after that nonetheless somewhere around here chronologically so you can see that your averages for each month 48 to 49 which again is fantastic that there isn't a spike during uh marathon training um that would put you below you know that super youthful basically i mean an average of 54 is what you'd expect to find in a 20-year-old and this is already in a you know pre-selected population people who are wearing fitness trackers uh generally aren't you know intending on being sedentary so um so you'd be even younger based on quote unquote uh or quotequote younger based on resting heart rate so fantastic news there all right so let's what else we got on my list here ah okay so then we've got uh vo2 max paper okay yeah all right so yep so what's been making the the rounds lately is uh the idea that we want to have vo2 max as high as possible and there's almost this skew of you know we need to be elite endurance a athletes to maximize our longevity and that's in part because of uh not to name drop but peter aa and peter is basically referencing this paper and this paper will be in the video's description um so if you're interested uh check it out and what they did here was they compared uh six groups of uh fitness levels from least fit to extremely fit they quantified it by mets we can be translated into v2 max so the extremely fit group group had a vo2 max of around 51 whereas the least fit was uh 17 so that's our range 17 least fit to 51 extremely fit and then when looking at mortality risk which is shown here all cause mortality risk when using the extremely fit group again vo2 max of 51 and comparing that against all the other groups people that had that v2 max in the least fit of 17 uh had a fourfold higher uh risk of death for all causes so the least fit fourfold higher risk of death for all causes so that that's the uh the idea that's been circulating that you know we need to have a v2 max as high as possible but i haven't seen peter mention any numbers so it's important to put that into context because because as you mentioned your pre-marathon training was 53 or 55 55 55 and this is without i mean what kind of training volume running wise per week well i'm i'm only doing uh a half an hour hour uh actually two half hour runs per week but i've been doing it consistently for um three or five years um so i think i'm pretty maxed out actually as far as my v2 max goes although i did gain even more once i bumped it up to marathon level training yeah but the point there is we don't need four hours or six hours i mean you're doing it from an hour and you've got a v to max 50 so i think that's an important point because like i said the the the the data the mean that's perpetuating on social media is that we've got to be elite endurance athletes and from your data one hour in conjunction with all the all the other weight training and everything else you're doing um v2 max over 50 you're in the extremely fit group so the the other thing too here is to to point out the extremely fit group vo2 max of 51 when compared with the high fit group which had a v2 max of 42 and i should say from my own experience i measured v2 max same thing face mask the whole thing a real v2x test not this uh you know estimated stuff based on resting heart rate which is not reliable or not nowhere near as close to reliable i mean there are you know people online who are like my my apple watch says my res heart rate is this my predicted v2 max is is 60 and and and i'm like dude you're 60 years old there's no way there's just no way so um so when comparing so from my own experience three v2 maxs in the lab uh from 2012 to 2017 or 2018 i was in the low 40s each time now that's with my regular workouts my full body 90minut workout plus walking it was 15 to 20 miles per week no running at all so you don't have to be an elite endurance athlete to be in the quote unquote high category for v2 max now is my v2 max the same since then i have measured i can't say um but at worst i'd imagine i'm in the fit group but i i' who knows i'd have to measure it the the the the interesting factor here is that v2 max is milliliters of oxygen consumed per kg body weight so i'm 20 lbs lighter or or 15 pounds lighter than i was then reducing the denominator so assuming my maximum ability to consume oxygen hasn't changed or even if it has changed with a lower cardio training volume i'm not walking 15 to 20 miles a week anymore on purpose um i find it hard to believe it would be dramatically different but all right nonetheless comparing the 51 v2 max versus the 40 42 you can see that even having high fitness 39% increased risk of death relative to the highest fit group okay so that's big news i mean that's basically saying you want to have your v2 max above 50 relative to the 40s right and to put that into further perspective you know people who had uh ckd chronic kidney disease 49% increased risk of death so you know being highfit is almost as bad as having ckd relative to someone who's uh extremely fit with vo2 max 51 so so this is very pretty pretty astounding data right but there is some devil in the details and uh this brings us to the mortality risk across fitness categories according to age groups so this study included a very wide age range um from 30 year olds all the way up to 90 year olds and you can see the sample sizes for each they're very large sample sizes which is great news and then comparing at each each age group getting all the way up to 80 to9 years from least fit to extremely fit and now the reference is defined as the people who were the least fit v2 max of about 17 so again once again within every group if your vo2 max was what was it 51 around 51 in the extremely fit group you had an 84% chance lower risk of all cause mortality for 30 to 49 year olds 78% 80% 66% 73% reduced relative to the least fit group but where the details start to become uh you know uh interesting at least for me is when you look at the highly fit group and see the extremely fit group okay now it's only a 10% difference in terms of lower risk now granted 10% is still a big deal i don't want to throw away any uh association for reducing mortality risk but this idea that the 40s versus the 50s in v2 max is this dramatic reduction maybe as bad as ckd or other smoking it's kind of overblown i mean here for 50 to 59 year olds there's only a 6% difference for the vo2 max of 42 versus the the 51 8% for the 60 to 69 year olds 133% and okay 15% but where this the story gets a bit more interesting is you know when considering that the 50 group um has a the lowest all cause mortality risk at every age range and is even better than the than the high fit group in terms of all all cause mortality risk then the expectation is well you must live to 115 years you must get or 120 you must get to the maximum lifespan your v2 max is 50 you're going to get to the max lifespan what's your life expectancy if you have a v2 max of greater than 50 so they looked at that and here it was men with peak exercise capacity of 10 to 12 mets that's a v2 max of 35 to 43 so this is not actually looking at the uh the greater than 50 so the fit and the highly fit they only live five four and a half years longer compared to the lowest fit the people who had a vo2 max of 17 i mean that's a fiveyear increase in average life expectancy and those with the extremely fit higher than uh 51 v2 max had a six-year this isn't a 25y year this is going from 73 to you know 79 years right so one thing i'm always talking about is how can we do better than the eat real food and exercise approach a vo2 max of 50 is great but if you're telling me i'm only going to expect to live to 80 that's just not good enough can we tight trate the exercise dose can we look at biomarkers of overtraining can we look at blood biomarkers to make sure our liver as you saw isn't chronically you know damaged or muscle damage all right so what about for the women so the story is about the same in this case the um the uh 10 to 11 and a half mets so that's a vo2 max of 35 to 40 they lived only 2 and a half years longer than the lowest fit group which is outrageous i mean their v2 max is double and you know if we only go by you want to have a v2 max as high as possible i mean that's only a two and a half year longer life expectancy and i'm not trying to diminish that it's important i just want to add context to what's already out there and then for the highest for the highest fit group just to finish it off real quick um for the highest fit group it was about seven years but again this is going from a life expectancy of 69 years in lowest fit to 76 again not 95 not 115 um so right so i i i agree with your point and i think that as you brought up the one of the more important things to look at is that this is divided by your body mass your your weight so this isn't one indicator of how your lung capacity is or your mitochondria is because as soon as you divide it by the weight that can overwhelm things if you're on the heavy side then even if your lung uh performance is above average if your weight is greater than that you're not going to be in the elite in the other elite despite the fact that you could be quite uh have quite a good cardiorespiratory system so um in some ways i feel like this is uh they talk about it being as fit as possible but in some ways i feel what they're really saying is that it's important to keep a low bmi overall so that's an interesting point because i should have brought up uh the the uh demographics the demographics in the paper and it it was the average the average bmi within groups within each age group was overweight or obese what that means is a bmi of 25 to 30 is considered overweight and actually if i remember correctly the bmi for each group was closer to 28 29 30 in each age group so these were overweight people and then in some cases it was uh an average bmi of 30 or more which is clinically defined as obese so but what that says is for this paper is if you are overweight or obese and can attain a v2 max of greater than 50 you will still have the lowest risk of all cause mortality but their models were adjusted for age sex bmi um but what you're raising is the more interesting point of what if your bmi was lean and you have the bmi the the the v2 max greater than 50 what's the life expectancy gain there and i didn't see that as a subset i wish they did but now that population is unfortunately probably very small talking a very very small group in terms of maybe hundreds not 20 or 30,000 that they had in each of these age groups so just to finish off too with the people who are older than 70 with a cardiorespiratory fitness greater than seven mets which is a vo2 max of 25 uh they only lived about three years longer compared to the lowest fit group so again you know this idea of of uh you know granted the i goal is to be as fit as possible not just you know strength and mobility balance but also v2 max this is only a two a three-year gain in life expectancy you know they lived to 87 years on average versus 85 years so um so i think it's important to frame the context of you know what what peter's putting out there uh you know that v2 max is an important component but i think we we need more specific markers uh it isn't just you know eat real food and exercise get good sleep it's how can we you know get the exercise prescription and get the dietary prescription and um you know look at biomarkers of organ and systemic function to really push us beyond these 87 and 95 year um you know caps for life expectancy in studies i mean i' i'd add to that uh play the long game on this when you're going for longevity um it's easy to if you're trying to maximize v2 or your v2 max right now this month unless you have a race coming up like a marathon it it you can take your time on it and over time even if you're starting at a standard level if you're continuing to practice it on a weekly basis eventually you will find yourself in the extremely fit group is sort of uh time takes its toll and you're able to reduce the normal losses you just age from in a sedentary fashion so what do you think about i agree 100% um i i have a couple factors too what do you think about the exercise dose that maximizes not as vo2 max but general fitness while also attempting to optimize heart rate variability and resting heart rate in other words high hrv low resting heart rate you know looking for that dose that maximizes all three where i think most people are only focused on how high can i get my v2 max and if my heart rate variability and resting heart rate looks overtrained and aged relative to my chronological age who cares right so what do you think about that combination as an exercise prescription so i i keep it uh minimal i'm always trying to get the most benefit for the the least amount of effort so um my aerobic exercise um despite being quite fit i'm very consistent so i virtually never miss even a week of exercising but just the the um two half an hour sessions of doing running um i find enough to keep the v2 max as long as it's on a really consistent basis um if you take like a month off off then all of a sudden then the low the low um the low dose doesn't work because it will take you too long to catch back up to where you were and then if you lose another month then now you're basically you're almost untrained um a study that i looked at that did vo2 max training had basically a a 12-week wash out period um to basically return the person their cardiorespiratory fitness b back to baseline as if they had never done any exercise at all so um it even before three months uh or 12 weeks of resting even if you're taking like two or three weeks i think that if you're combining it with a low regular dosage is going to be a problem but if you're able to be consistent in it then you can use that to optimize both your hrv and uh high and your heart resting heart rate low by only doing a little bit of exercise each week i actually find that on my exercise days because it's half an hour i know that your routines are usually more on an hour or so if i remember correctly 90 90 minutes not there you go an hour and a half so i don't even notice an impact on my hrv or resting heart rate the day after i do those exercises in fact those are some my better days because they're combined with my fasting and other things so um i think the key to to to working all those dials is to find a very efficient uh thing and then do the get the most benefit out of doing the least effort on it and then be consistent about it yeah cool consistency is definitely king when it comes to fitness but actually any any activity you can make the same argument about fasting or calorie intake right if you're better at hitting a certain calorie goal like i hate to say put it in a loop but it'll be easier or it should be easier because you've been doing it for so long where if you do fall off it should be easier to go back right so um all right so then the other aspect too is there's a training dose that's not just involving hit and cardio if that's a part of your not just your approach but others approach if the approach is exclusively focused on cardio and you know not on attenuating strength losses during aging or flexibility losses during aging so if you're spending all of your time dominated by a marathon type training maybe one wouldn't have the time or energy to put into these other aspects of fitness that decline during aging so for me it's how can i get the cardiovascular benefit from my 90-minute workouts while also training you know mobility balance flexibility to make sure i'm you know when i'm 8090 100 i i'm mobble and look like a young person relative to you know my chronological age yeah the uh the other aspects uh the balance is one that i also follow with so i i i do my balance things are kind of um leaning against comfort i guess so i still put on my shoes and socks while standing up on one foot yes brush my teeth with my eyes closed in the tree pose and my yoga tree pose okay using my hand for that just making sure that you're you're trying to fight against that sort of normal loss of getting well just kind of sit down or whatever um the the flexibility i usually work on through the weightlifting um you can get good flexibility by doing squats and deadlifts will work the hamstring um structure very well so i keep that up um but i i agree it's got to be you've got to make sure that you're kind of hitting across the panel um i have some friends who are very intense uh on the aerobic and then we'll do something like climb a small hill or something and because they haven't been doing any of the the deadlifts or the squats or things and they have the lungs to handle it but sort of the exhaustion of the amount of effort they have to put into it they get tired much more quickly um for the effort because they haven't got the muscles to back it up yeah so my 15-year-old when she puts on her shoes is constant banging into the walls you know you would because she her balance is terrible she doesn't train it so even at any age if you're not training it i do the same thing you know on one foot put the sock and the shoe on i do that every day you know it's so uh but that's only a part of a small part of it but yeah it's i think most people neglect it and then it's oh no look i don't have good balance you know and the hit hit helps with that stuff too because you know lifting one leg and accelerating and pushing forward i mean you have to have balance in order to do that you know know to to to sprint so that helps too so i think we covered it all chris i think we covered it all what do you think yeah i think uh i think that's good um yeah um really happy to have done the marathon thanks for giving me a chance to kind of tell my tale and uh where that stuff comes from and uh we're very much on the same page as far as kind of working the the full picture of uh working through both making sure that you're getting the right amount of exercise but also watching sort of your measurements that you don't overstress yourself at the same time definitely cool all right thanks chris until next time all right thanks a lot right all right later bye all right shout
