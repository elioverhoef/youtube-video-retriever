Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the third time in 2022 so what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and what we can see is that my biological age is 35.3 which is 14 years younger than my chronological age of 49.3 now note that quest's high sensitivity c-reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be somewhere less than 0.3 anywhere in the zero to 0.3 range but it can't be higher than 0.3 which is what i entered for this test now note that if you're interested in seeing screenshots of the actual lab report rather than me entering the numbers all of the blood test data will be included at the end of the video and if you have your own biomarker data i'll i'll include a link to phenoage a free link that you can calculate it on your own uh and that'll be in the video's description the link to that will be in the video's description so a question that i get a lot is how good is levine's biological age calculator levine's test is strongly correlated with chronological age as you can see by the image where we're looking at phenotypic age on the y-axis plotted against chronological age and what we can see is an almost perfectly linear correlation between biological age using the venus test with chronological age so a perfectly linear correlation is a correlation coefficient of 1.0 so in two separate studies the correlation for levine's test with chronological age was 0.94 in nhane 3 which included about 10 000 subjects and in a separate study that correlation was 0.96 in nhanes 4 which included more than 11 000 subjects now levine's test isn't just strongly correlated with chronological age it's also associated with a redu or it's also associated with all-cause mortality risk and more specifically for every one-year biological age increase using levene's test all-cause mortality risk increases by nine percent so we want to have more youthful biological ages using this test in order to have a reduced risk of death for all causes now another question that often arises is how does levine test compare with the best epigenetic clocks for its correlation with chronological age so the best performing epigenetic clock for its prediction of chronological age is the horvath test and we can see that here when looking at epigenetic age on the y-axis plotted against chronological age and this is a multi-tissue epigenetic age clock that included cells from the breast cheek cells brain colon blood skin etc you can see the list on the right nonetheless we can see that it's an almost perfectly linear correlation the epigenetic test horvat's epigenetic test with chronological age with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 which is very similar to the levine's test which uses the blood-based biomarkers so to answer that question levine's test is as good as the best epigenetic clock or vas test for predicting chronological age now note that this is only data for one blood test so it's important to have more context and see how test number three results compare against previous data so let's have a look at biological age results since 2020 and that's what we can see here so first in 2020 i measured six times six separate blood tests and we can see that my biological age using levine's test was 35.6 years similarly in 2021 over six tests also an average age of 35.6 years so what about 2022 so that's we can see with the green dots and after three tests so far in 2022 my average is less at 34.4 years so i'm off to a good start in terms of levine's test biological age now note that prior to 2022 so prior to these three blood tests in 2022 my average biological age reduction relative to chronological age was about 12 years 11.9 years to be exact and that's over 15 tests from 2018 to 2021 but in 2022 so far the reduction for biological age uh subtracted from chronological age for test number one it was 16.4 years test number two 13.5 and test number three 13.6 for an average reduction so far in 2022 of 14.5 years so i've been able to reduce my levine's test biological age by an average of an extra 2.6 years so far in 2022 let's see if i can keep it up for the remainder of 2022. Now note that phenoage includes chronological age in its model which limits the maximum biological age reduction for example if you're 60 years old and all of your biomarkers are youthful or what's found in youth at best the levine test will only show you as about 40. So in contrast aging aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so before showing you my aging.ai 3.3.0 data uh how good is this test for its prediction uh of chronological age and its association with all-cause mortality risk is it so first we can see that the correlation for aging.ai aging.ais 19 biomarkers with chronological age is 0.8 which is a little bit worse than levine's test but it's still pretty good it's still considered a strong correlation so what about all-cause mortality risk well a relatively younger aging.ai age in this paper was shown to be significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so again we want to have more youthful biological ages using both these tests at least based on the all-cause mortality data all right so what about my data for this test what's my biological age so when uh using the 19 biomarkers and entering that data as you can see there aging that age ageing.ei gives me a predicted age of 32 years which is 17.3 years younger than my chronological all right so just like we did for the means test let's have a little bit more context by looking at previous data for aging.aih now i have a lot more data for aging.ai age as i've been measuring uh most of these biomarkers since at least 2009 uh in in contrast with the levene's test which includes high sensitivity c-reactive protein that's not a commonly performed test you'd have to ask your doctor to order that so uh i have a lot more data for aging.eye because it doesn't include crp so starting from 2009 i was measuring about once a year just going to my my doctor just the yearly physical and then recording that data in an excel spreadsheet so from 2009 to 2013 over that period i have three blood tests and my average aging.ai age was 32 years and then in 2016 2016 i decided to test more often as you can see by all the dots and over the six year period from 2016 to 2021 i have 27 blood tests and over those 27 blood tests my average aging.ai age is 29.9 years all right so what about 2022 so so far over those three blood test measurements my average aging.ai age is 28.7 so that's also lower than my 29.9 over the six year period starting from 2016 and also better than the three tests from 2009 to 2013. So hopefully i can keep it up for the rest of the year and going forward all right so what's contributing to these biological age reductions uh supplements fitness and or diet and in the interest of time uh that'll be in the next few videos all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day you
