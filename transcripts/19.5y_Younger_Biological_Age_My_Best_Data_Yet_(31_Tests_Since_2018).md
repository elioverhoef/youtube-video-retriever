# 19.5y Younger Biological Age: My Best Data Yet (31 Tests Since 2018)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize or attempt to optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so apologies if you've heard that now a trillion times but that's the central premise of this channel so with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the second time in 2024 and note that this is now test number 50 since 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and if you have blood test data and you want to calculate calculate your own biological age using this metric there'll be a link in the video's description a downloadable free link no email required so when entering these data these nine biomarkers and chronological age i got a biological age of 31.7 years which is 19.5 years younger than my chronological now note that for the data could actually be younger than 31.7 years as for the 16th consecutive test quest lab's hs crp measurement was less than 0.3 mg per liter in other words crp could be less than that but not more than that as that's their limit of detection and rather than looking at blood test data entered into a spreadsheet there'll be screenshots of the lab test report coming up in about a minute or two now this is just one one test it's important to not get too excited about one test as it could just be an outlier so with that in mind let's take a look at biological age results for more context since 2018 as i have 31 tests over that time period and that's what we can see here so from 2018 to 2019 three tests over two years average fenal age was 36.1 years and i wasn't i didn't include hscrp at every blood test back then just because it's not included on the cbc here in the states so so after 2019 i started to include it for every test such that there were 12 tests six in 2020 and 6 in 2021 and for both of those years average feno wage was 35.6 years now that's probably closer to a true representation of year-to-year changes relative to 2018 to 2019 where it was only three tests then in 2022 i reduced it to 33.8 years it went up in the wrong direction 34.7 in 2023 and thus far in after two tests in 2024 average fenal wage is off to a good start at an average of 33 33 years now it's all also important to note that the latest test of 31.7 is my best data to date over 31 tests so then a big question is can i maintain this 19.5 year reduction going forward or is it just an anomaly but for now let's dig into the full blood test report as biological age clocks clocks may have have weak spots so it's important to highlight other aspects of the blood test report so first hdl at 61 is my highest since 2015 uh my average hdl since 2015 over 50 tests is 46 milligrams per deciliter now in in disagreement with the idea that 61 is just a fluke or a random thing hdl is now greater than or equal to 50 milligram per deciliter for the seventh consecutive test and if you're interested in knowing how i i've been able to move the needle uh i post correlations in the correlations tr on patreon so check that out if interested now ldl at 82 isn't tremendously high but i purposely was aiming for the higher end of my recent range as relatively higher ldl may lead to a younger donan pace a younger epigenetic pace of aging and if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner i don't yet have results for the need and pace but once that data arrives in late march early april expected see a video coming very shortly thereafter all right so then we can see the hs crp at less than 0.3 and then at the bottom we can see glucose at 84 and i've highlighted glucose because my average glucose since 2015 over 48 tests is about 90 milligrams per deciliter so hopefully i'm able to consistently keep glucose a bit lower going forward all right on to page two creatin now for the second test in row is at 0.91 and that's potentially important because my 50 test average is 1.0 mig per deciliter now that's potentially important because creatinine levels increase during aging as a potential marker of poor kidney function or reduced uh kidney function during aging so that i've reduced it by a bit is potentially good news also quest lab flagged two biomarkers as being out of range the first is globulin at 1.8 which is low now i haven't come across how globulin changes during aging if anyone has seen that data in a relatively large study please post it in the comments uh but there is all cause mortality data where values around three or higher are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk in older adults so generally lower for globulin and avoiding any potential age related increase would be good news so i don't see i'm not worried about a 1.8 being on the lower side for globulin accordingly because the alumin to globulin ratio includes a relatively low globulin with a relatively high albumin 5.1 in my case which is youthful quest lab also flagged the ratio all right so also previous alt and liver enzymes were 24 and 28 respectively whereas now they are 23 and 25 so that's moving in the right direction as values in the low 20s are associated with lowest all cause mortality risk whereas values approaching the upper 20s and beyond is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and then there were improvements to red blood cell related measure measures including total red blood cells 4.9 for this test versus 4.53 for the last hemoglobin 14.9 for this test versus 14.6 for the last both red blood cells and hemoglobin declined during aging so this is moving back in the right direction after the last test which which moved in the wrong direction and then also the mcv the mean corpuscular volume so this is the average volume of red blood cells which increases during aging uh i was able to flip that to reverse it by a bit from 92.3 from the last test down to 90.8 and again if you're curious about how how i've been able to do this i follow correlations between diet with the biomarkers and those those correlations are posted in the correlations tier on patreon i also sent a bunch of other stuff for analysis on that march 4th test date including nad epigenetic and t testing and metabolomic so expect update videos for those bi markers coming in future videos but now there are still two outstanding questions and the first one i touched upon it earlier can i repeat these data for test number three which is scheduled for april 29th in 2024 so i don't want this to just be a one test anomaly i want to be able to maintain at least the 19.5 year reduction for every test going forward and then also the next question would be is can i maintain that for years and have no age related increase in that 19.5 year reduction and then also what diet and supplements correspond to this 19.5 year younger biological age and that will be in next week's video so stay tuned for that all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i include blood test consults we've also got some discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic and tmia testing nad quantification oral microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
