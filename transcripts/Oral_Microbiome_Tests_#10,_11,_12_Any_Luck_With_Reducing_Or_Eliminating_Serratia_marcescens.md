# Oral Microbiome Tests #10, 11, 12: Any Luck With Reducing Or Eliminating Serratia marcescens?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

I have a big problem in my salivary microbiome and that involves the bacterium sadium maresin or sadia for short which has been implicated in a whole host of adverse human health related conditions as shown here including pneumonia sepsis menitis and others on this list now i currently have three more data points for the oral microbiome composition including sadia levels with test number 10 11 and 12 so was there any luck in reducing or limiting ating sadium maresin to test that i sent saliva to bristle and if you're interested in measuring your own oral microbiome composition there's a discount link in the video's description so jumping right into the data we've got levels of sadia for the first nine tests and we can see that for six of the tests seraia levels were almost completely dominating my oral microbiome with 88% of all bacteria at the lowest and 96% at the highest for sadia now now there is some room for optimism though because my best chance so far in limiting seria has been with a homemade mouthwash as in two of those five tests where i used the homemade mouthwash there was zero seria but it's not a perfect system because also in two of those five tests it was 88% and 95% so investigating further what's in the mouthwash could stuff in the mouthwash be uh getting rid of sadia so in the mouthwash is 1% xylitol 1% sodium bicarbonate and 2 to three drops of peppermint oil so for test number 10 i decided to collect more data using this standard mouthwash three to five times per day to see what effect it would have and for test number 10 there was some success 0% seraia once again so now i've got six tests three of those tests with the mouthwash zero sadia so that's potentially good news so is there something in the mouthwash that could be eliminating this bacterium so it could be xylitol there's published data in vitro that 5% xylitol solutions can uh reduce serati levels by about 80% so in an earlier video i tested that hypothesis and unfortunately it didn't work for me as on that day of testing there was 96% sadia so technically i could go higher again to retest that but knowing that 5% didn't make a dent i've shied away from using higher doses of xylol uh again uh conversely though is it the sodium concentration because you can see sodium is a content in my homemade mth mouthwash 1% sodium bicarbonate contains sodium so there is published in vitro data for sodium chloride reducing sadia levels as shown here with levels of sadium maresin on the y- axis plotted against the sodium chloride concentration and again note that this is an inv vitro study there aren't any clinical trials randomized clinic clinical trials that have studied this at least not yet so i'm kind of on my own looking into what's been published using in vitro studies so when looking at the correlation for the sodium chloride concentration with sadia levels we can see it there's an inverse correlation in other words relatively higher levels of sodium chloride reduce uh sadia as shown there and conversely lower levels of sodium chloride there were higher levels of sadia and that's i should note at a ph of 7 and at 30Â° c which is relatively close to physiological levels so for test number 11 i decided to test this correlation this published cor by adding about 3% sodium chloride to the homemade mouthwash and i did that by adding sea salt which is almost exclusively sodium chloride for a total concentration of 4% since 1% sodium bicarbonate is already in the mix adding another 3% sodium chloride should have brought the sodium content to 4% but it didn't work for test number 11 seraia went to its highest level yet 97.3% which is just outrageous literally 97% of my sal salivary microbiome is just one bacterium i mean this is terrible news but then i thought maybe there's a u-shaped curve even though this is a linear correlation maybe there's a u shape in other words no salt good for seria very high salt potentially good for seria by some unknown mechanism but maybe there's a bottom of the u- shape where if i go a little bit less than 4% maybe that can make a dent so i decided to give it a try and i did that by adding 1% sodium chloride again by using sea salt adding that to the pre-existing standard mouthwash so 1% sodium bicarbonate 1% sodium chloride or 1% sea salt and that led to serra levels on that day of 0% so actually i used the mouthwash for about 2 weeks prior to each test this isn't just on the day of testing so for two of these three most recent tests no sadia which brings the eight test total with the standard mouthwash to 4 days zero seria in 4 days unfortunately there was sadia so i'm still trying to figure out what the recipe is for continuously keeping seria at zero and then the next step is what does my actual microbiome look like without seria and what can i do to further improve that but one step at a time now i also sent data for test number 13 and 14 using vanillin so what is vanillin vanillin is one of the metabolites that give vanilla beans its characteristic vanilla smell and it's potentially important because it reduces sadium maresins as shown here and again this is in vitro there's no published rct data so i'm kind of on my own in looking at what's been published in inv vitro studies so in the y- axis we've got the log colony forming units of seria so how much serat was in the cell cultured dish plotted against time after exposure to vanillin and we compared with the control condition as shown there so sadia grown on glucose we can see that after adding vanillin 1% seria levels were almost completely eliminated within 8 hours and then even a lower dose of of vanillin .55% so about half the vanillin dose completely eliminated sadia levels within about 48 hours or 2 days so for test number 13 and 14 i decided to test these two concentrations 1% for the first test and 6% for the second test so results for test number 13 are in i'm not ready to present them yet test number 14 results have not yet come in once those results come in i'll package them together for a vanillin focused sadia uh video so stay tuned for that sometime in the next few weeks all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that
