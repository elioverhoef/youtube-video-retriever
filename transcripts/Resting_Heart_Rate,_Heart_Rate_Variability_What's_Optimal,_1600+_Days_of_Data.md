## Transcript

Resting heart rate and heart rate variability provide information about the integration between the nervous system and adrenal gland with the heart we can see that here so sympathetic nerve activity and parasympathetic nerve activity more specifically the vagus nerve in addition to sympathetic nerve activity induced adrenal gland release of norepinephrine and epinephrine impact resting heart rate and heart rate variability so with that in mind what's optimal for resting heart rate and heart rate variability more specifically how do resting heart rate and heart rate variability change during aging also in this video we'll take a look at my data as i now have more than 1600 days for both of these metrics and also what's contributing to improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability so first how does the resting heart rate change during aging we can see that here so we're looking at the average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age on the x and in this case the age range is from 20 to 50 years and this is whoops data as i've been wearing whoops since 2018. So for both women in red and men in blue we can see that the resting heart rate increases for both men and women up to 50 years now what about older than 50 years so we can see that data here and this is in a published study of more than 90 000 fitbit users once again we've got average wrestling heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age on the x and in agreement with whoops data we can again see an age-related increase for resting heart rate up to 50 years but then we can see that the resting heart rate declines up into 80 up up until 85 years so we can then also see that relatively low resting heart rates are found in both young and people that are of advanced age so how would we know if a relatively low wrestling heart rate was indicative of youth or aging and that's where heart rate variability comes in as that provides more context so what is hrv so the definition of hrv is it's the variability for the time in between heartbeats so what does that mean well for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute the assumption is that the heart beats exactly once per second but that's not necessarily true here we can see the time in between three consecutive heartbeats and you can see that the times are not all the same 859 793 and 726 milliseconds in between each heartbeat and the variability in that data is then calculated as heart rate variability and more specifically whoop uses the rmssd root mean squared of successive differences so because that's what they report that's the data that i'm going to present going forward in this video so with that in mind how does heart rate variability or more specifically the rmssd change during aging and we can see that data here this is in a study of more than 8.2 million people and these are our fitbit users so first and then i should mention too we've got the rm ssd as the hrv metric on the y-axis plotted against age and the age range going from 20 to 60 years and then we've got two different curves on this graph we've got solid lines and dashed lines the solid lines are when hrv was recorded at six in the morning and the dashed lines were when it was recorded at six at night so at uh for both of these time points we can see that the highest heart rate variability values are found at six in the morning when compared with six at night now whoop provides hrv data first thing in the morning as the average during sleep so that's the data i'm going to focus on the six and six in the morning curves and what we can see is that hrv declines during aging for both men and women now to we now we can go back to our question of is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so in youth resting heart rate is relatively low and heart rate variability is relatively high conversely in advanced age there there can also be low resting heart rates but also low heart rate variability now i've tracked both of these metrics resting heart rate and heart rate variability since august of 2018 and as i mentioned it's more than 1600 days of data so what's my data now based on popular these population-based averages up to 50 years old micronological or by pretty much close to my chronological age i'm going to turn 50 next week uh we can expect to see that my resting heart rate has increased but my heart rate variability has decreased so is that true let's take a look so first we're going to take it take a look at my average yearly resting heart rate in beats per minute and this is from august 5th of 2018 through january 14th of 2023 and again this is 1 618 days of data and we can see that we can see that here so when i first started tracking in 2018 my year full year not full year but my partial year average starting in august of 2018 uh average for resting heart rate was 50.9 beats per minute so about 51 beats per minute and then in 2019 i reduced that to a yearly average full year average for resting heart rate of 48.9 beats per minute now rather than just looking at uh averages yearly averages year to year we can compare these two groups of data with a two sample t-test and when i do that we can see that i always i significantly reduced my resting heart rate in 2019 48.9 from 50.9 as that p value is less than 0.05. In 2020 similarly i reduced the resting heart rate to 48.1 beats per minute and again that's the full year average each dot on this plot is one day's worth of data and when using a two sample t-test this too was better than the 2018 value of about 51 beats per minute now we can also look at year-over-year changes in addition to comparing 2020 versus 2018 what about 2020 versus 2019 and when doing that we can see that i was able to significantly reduce the resting heart rate from 48.9 in 2019 to 48.1 in 2021 i further reduced my resting heart rate to 47.4 for the full year average which was significantly lower than where i started in 2018 and also significantly lower when compared with 2020. In 2022 i also reduced my resting heart rate to 45 beats per minute and again this is a full year average which was significantly lower than where i started in 2018 and also significantly lower when compared with 2021. Thus far over the first 14 days in 2023 my average resting heart rate is 44 and a half beats per minute which is significantly lower than where i started in 2018 but just outside of significance when compared with 2022. So from these data we can see that i've consistently reduced my resting heart rate from 2018 to 2023 that's a typo it should say 2023. So is that good or bad now if you remember our question from earlier is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging we can see that a relatively low resting heart rate is found in youth but also in advanced age so one thing for sure is that i've definitely resisted the age-related increase for resting heart rate as based on this plot we can expect we could we could have expected to see my resting heart rate increase up until about 50 years but then also notice that it's possible that because i've reduced resting heart rate over the past four plus years i may be experiencing the age-related decline for resting heart rate so how can we assess that so for more context let's have a look at heart rate variability data since 2018 and that's what we're going to look at here over that same time period more than 1600 days of data so when i first started tracking heart rate variability it was 47.3 milliseconds in 2018. In 2019 i increased that to 56.2 and again using a two sample t-test to to compare these two groups of data and again each dot refers to a single day's worth of data so when using a two sample t-test i was able to significantly increase heart rate variability in 2019 when compared with 2018 as you can see that the p-value is significantly lower or it's lower than 0.05 in 2020 i also was able to keep my heart rate variability relatively high at 57.8 milliseconds which was significantly better than where i started in 2018 but just outside of statistical significance when compared with 2019 so in other words 2019 data is not different from 2020 data 56.2 is not significantly different uh with 57.8 just outside significance with the p-value of 0.07 but then in 2021 i had a regression a heart rate variability went down to 51.9 milliseconds which although it was better than where i started in 2018 was significantly worse when compared with 2020 and note that a lower heart rate variability would be going in the wrong direction as heart rate variability declines during aging so in 2022 a major focus was to reverse that trend and to get my heart rate variability back up to where it was in 2019 and 2020 or better so for 2022 my average heart rate heart rate variability was 59.3 milliseconds which was a significant improvement when compared to 2018 and also a significant significantly increase when compared with 2021 so i successively reversed that trend uh that that i experienced in 2021 and thus far in 2023 my average heart rate variability over the first 14 days is 62.4 milliseconds which again is significantly better than where i started in 2018 but just outside of significance when compared with 2022 so 59.3 and 2022 is about the same as or is similar to my current average in 2023 of 62.4 milliseconds so for heart rate variability we can see that i've consistently increase or not consistently increased it with that dip in 2021 but i've increased it from 2018 to 2022 with a small amount of data in 2020 three too little data yet to make any definitive conclusions so how did these data compare with age-related changes for heart rate variability so for that we go back to this plot of 8.2 million people now for what's expected based on my chronological age of almost 50 is a median heart rate variability of 35.1 milliseconds as illustrated by that red arrow there so at worst 59 to 62 milliseconds my current range for heart rate variability is above the heart rate variability range for my chronological age that's at worst that's seemingly good news though but at best 50 59 to 62 milliseconds for heart rate variability is the median value for someone about 22 years younger so it's potentially indicative of a youthful heart so and to go back to our question of is a relatively low wrestling heart rate indicative of youth or aging now we can answer that question because we have the data for heart rate variability put into context so in my case a relatively a high heart rate variability plus plus low resting heart rate suggests as i mentioned cardiovascular cardiovascular youth sorry in contrast based on my chronological age a lower heart rate variability plus a higher resting heart rate 35 for hrv about 57 based on whoops uh data would be expected based on chronological age all right so what's contributing to these improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability over the past four plus years so first what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate so here we're looking at my average monthly body weight and note that i weigh myself every morning this is after number one and two and that's fasted and each thought in this case is the monthly average so around 30 days of data for each month in one dot and then on the right we've got the average monthly heart rate too over that same time period so from august 2018 to january of 2023 or at least half the month of january 2023 and we can see that these two graphs look somewhat similar as body weight has decreased as indicated by the green arrows correspondingly resting heart rate has also decreased during those periods and conversely during periods where body weight has increased resting hardware hitters also increased as shown by the red arrows now it aside from just looking at two separate plots we can look at the correlation between these two metrics body weight and resting heart rate so is body weight significantly correlated with resting heart rate and that's what we can see here so in this case now we're looking at daily resting heart rate versus body weight over those 1600 day plus period so in this case each thought is a single day's worth of data and what we can see is a significant positive correlation in other words as body weight has increased that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate conversely as body weight approaches 149 pounds on the left side of this graph or of this plot resting heart rate approaches 45 beats per minute but what about less than 149 pounds as you can see i don't yet have data uh lighter than 149 pounds so a major goal of 2023 is to slowly reduce my body weight and collect that data and see if if this trend leads to even further reductions for resting heart rate all right what about for heart rate variability what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability and that's we can see here so again we've got the average multi-body weight on the left now we've got average monthly heart rate variability over the same time period on the right and now the two graphs don't look uh to they don't seem to overlap they don't look as obvious as the resting heart rate trend but nonetheless there are some trends here still so during periods where body weight had decreased heart rate variability increased and conversely during a time when body weight increased heart rate variability decreased now besides besides just looking at two graphs we can then look more specifically to see if body weight is significantly correlated with heart rate variability and that's we've got here this is the daily heart rate variability versus body weight over that same 1600 day plus time span and again in this case each thought is a single day's worth of data so now we can see a significant negative or inverse correlation in other words as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability and conversely as my body weight has approached lighter values in this case 149 pounds would be my lightest during this time span heart rate variability has approached 60 milliseconds and just like for resting heart rate i don't yet have data over over that four year time span being lighter than 149 pounds so a major goal of 2023 again is to get a bit leaner and see how that impacts not just a resting heart rate but heart rate variability so to answer the question what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability and resting heart rate both of these metrics approach youthful values as body weight decreases at least in my case now physical activity also obviously impacts both resting heart rate and heart rate variability so let's take a look at that data so here with the using the average daily heart rate as a metric of daily physical activity let's take a look at its potential impact on heart rate variability and resting heart rate now as i mentioned the adhr is an index of daily physical activity whole day physical activity but also it could be indicative of stress too and i've had the unfortunate experience of not having a workout but having a day with an average heart rate as high as a workout day just from you know work stress or emotional stress and i try to minimize those days as much as i can but sometimes they're just unavoidable so a higher average daily heart rate equals more physical activity plus more overall stress so what's the correlation for the adhr with next day resting heart rate and that's what we can see here now i don't have 1600 plus days of data for this as i didn't have the idea unfortunately to track this from 2018 it took me about 600 days to realize that this was this was an important metric and to start tracking it so i have about a thousand days of data for the average daily heart rate and we're going to look at its correlation with resting heart rate and heart rate variability and what we can see here is that there's a significant positive correlation in other words the higher the average daily heart rate the worse or the higher that the next day resting heart rate would be which means that too much daily activity and too often is bad for resting heart rate at least in my case what about the this correlation with heart rate variability and that's we can see here again over that same time span about a thousand days of data now we can see a significant negative or inverse correlation which suggests again that too much daily activity too often will be bad for heart rate variability in other words the higher the average daily heart rate the worse my next morning heart rate variability so finding the balance between active and rest days is important for optimizing resting heart rate and heart rate variability so what does that look like it's easy to say but what does that look like and i mentioned this in my last video in this series but just to show it again to reiterate so this is a screenshot of the one week period for my average daily heart rate and the active days are the ones that have heart rates of 59 beats per minute so that includes my usual workout which is an 80 minute full body workout so starting with the first 59 then you can see that there are three relatively lower overall activity days 53 i think 55 and 54 beats per minute and those are intentional i purposely titrate overall activity down or titrated overall activity down over those three days before having my next workout thereby allowing resting heart rate and heart rate variability to more fully recover and then the next 59 was uh so that was four days after the the first workout but i also follow a three-day workout approach so that was a 59 there and then i titrated activity down for the next two days and then i had the next workout on on on day three so it's a three day four day approach basically two workouts a week 80 minutes per session with usually light walking on the lower activity days all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon
