# Supercentenarian (112 - 116y) Blood Test Analysis (Part I)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The central premise of this channel is that aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we can track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind let's take a look at blood test data from jirahiman kimura jirahiman was a super centenarian this is defined as anyone living to older than 110 years old in jarahiman's case he lived to a 116 and his data were recently published in this study here clinical course of the longest live lived man in the world a case report all right so there are three main time points that were reported in that study uh when jirahiman was 111 and a half years old 113.3 years old and 115.7 years old and then we're gonna i'm gonna cover about half of his blood biomarker data i may go into part two in a separate video so what's good in terms of his blood test results what's uh bad in terms of his blood test results and if you notice creatinine hasn't been boxed we'll see uh in a few slides that creatinine is creatinine data is incomplete so first what's good so uh jarahiman's fasting blood sugar so his fasting glucose levels as shown here were 80 11 and 87 milligrams per deciliter so let's put that data into context so here we're looking at fasting uh blood glucose levels as a function of age all the way up until 88 years and i'm only going to cover data for men as this relates directly to jirahiman so as you can clearly see glucose increases during aging and if we take jarahiman's average data over these three measurements over this four year period his average is 92.7 milligrams per deciliter which put his puts his data closer to someone who's in their 30s rather than someone who was in their hundred and tens so what about all-cause mortality risk so there's a j shaped curve for all caused mortalities with values less than 80 being associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk but then also when considering that glucose increases during aging relatively higher levels so higher than 94 are associated also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and we can see by putting jarahiman's average data that he's close to the lowest uh portion of the curve so he's at lowest risk for all-cause mortality based on his fasting glucose data so from that we can conclude that jarahiman's glucose data was relatively youthful and he's got healthy as defined by the all-cause mortality data levels of glucose now next up is hemoglobin a1c so this is a marker of how much what percentage of hemoglobin is glycated so let's put his data into context so he had values of 5 5.3 and 5.2 percent for hba1c so blood levels of hb1c are plotted here on the y-axis against age and what we can see is that hba1c significantly increases during aging and if we take jarahiman's average data over those three measurements we can see that his value places him somewhere uh similar to to a person in their 20s to you know 20s to 30 which is again 80 to 90 years younger than his chronological age so what about all-cause mortality risk so here we're looking at a meta-analysis of six studies that included about 29 000 people with uh hba1c values of five about 5.3 defined as the reference and what we can see is that for values less than five and uh a little bit higher than 5.5 so somewhere around 5.8 there was no increase for all-cause mortality risk when compared with 5.3 however however people who have hba1c values greater than six had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so in jorahiman's case his average hba1c was very close to the reference or in other words very close to lowest risk for all-cause mortality so from this we can conclude similar to the glucose data that jurajiman's hba1c is relatively youthful and he's got healthy levels of hba1c all right moving on along white blood cells so let's put his data into context so here we're looking at data from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging where about 2300 2800 people sorry were followed for more than 40 years so starting with the baseline assessment of white blood cells wbc life expectancy was evaluated again up to 40 plus years after the baseline assessment so the longest life expectancy and note that we can look at 50 survival so median survival this is the time when half of the population is dead and half is alive and because this is a longitudinal study this is one of the rare times that i am able to say this in the video that it isn't applied to a mouse study uh because we've seen this on this channel media and survival often presented so there are very few longitudinal studies in humans so it's nice to be able to present longitudinal data in a human study all right so in terms of median survival we can see that the longest life expectancy was for people who had a white blood cell count of 3 500 to 6 000 white blood cells per microliter so starting with that baseline assessment they live about 37 years starting from the baseline assessment so what about relatively high levels of white blood cells in this case towards the higher end of the range six thousand to ten thousand white blood cells per microliter so we can see that their life expectancy expectancy wasn't as long as people who had thirty five hundred to 6 000 they lived about 30 years and with an even shorter life expectancy were people who lived uh who had white blood cells that were at the highest end of the range so about ten thousand ten thousand uh white blood cells per microliter so they lived about 25 years or had a life expectancy of about 25 years 12 years shorter than the longest life expectancy now worst of mall were was life expectancy for people who had white blood cells that were 3 500 or less and as we can see there is no median survival there because all of the that population was dead uh 22 years later so what about drajiman's data so we can see that all of his three blood test measurements are within that 3 500 to 6 000 white blood cell range so this is good he's as he's got uh the longest life expectancy uh based or the longest life expectancy based on what his data shows now there's a small downside to this is that all white blood cells are not the same in other words what's the distribution for neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes which have varying uh changes during aging for example lymphocytes decline during aging whereas neutrophils increase during aging so that can kind of mask the overall effect if we only look at white blood cells but that data wasn't presented in the paper so we can't assess it all right next on the list c reactive protein so inflammation and what we can see from jarahiman's three day three data points is that he had outstandingly low c-reactive protein net his first measurement at 115.5 years so uh note that this data is in milligrams per deciliter and if you've commonly entered your dain in data into levine's phenotypic age that's in milligrams per liter so to convert it we multiply his data by 10. So 0.3 milligrams per liter is outstandingly low at the first measurement but then notice that his his c-reactive protein increased six-fold at the second measurement and ten-fold uh when he was about 116 years old relatively close to when he died so let's put his data into a little bit more context than that here we're looking at median values for high sensitivity c reactive protein plotted against age with 18 to 30 year olds the youngest group on the left all the way up to people older than 70 on the right so when using jarahiman's first data and when considering that c-reactive protein increases during aging as shown by the red line so when putting drahiman's data into context on this uh picture we can see that he would have very low levels of c reactive protein when compared with the rest of the population so taking that a step forward we can assess all-cause mortality risk and this is data for the fully adjusted model for c-reactive protein versus all-cause mortality risk and in this study less than 0.21 milligrams per liter was defined as a reference and this is at pretty close to as low as it can get for c-reactive protein so jurajiman's data at least when he was about 112 years old was in this range here the 0.21 is 0.43 as he had 0.3 milligrams per liter now note that the confidence interval the data in parentheses 0.84 to 1.51 overlaps with 1. So from this we can conclude that 0.21 to 0.43 is not significantly different from the reference in other words he was pretty close to the lowest risk for all-cause mortality in the first measurement 111 years old 111 and a half years old however in his next two measurements 1.8 and 3 milligrams per liter that would put him here which is pretty close to higher than everyone else uh in that study and also in terms of all-cause mortality risk it would put him in the greater than 1.02 milligrams per liter group which had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk as as you can see that confidence interval is completely above one 1.41 to 2.43 so but as so note that for as a potential explanation for uh his longevity was jirahiman's c-reactive protein low from most of his lifespans so that's completely unknown is this point three milligrams per liter at 111 and a half years old this is something he maintained for his whole life or was his data higher and then it reduced for one time point and then went back up there's no way to know but at the very least that he had very low inflammation at 112 years old is very encouraging in terms of how inflammation affects us during aging and being able to potentially limit inflammation as a potential strategy to live super long if we can keep our inflammation low all right moving right along triglycerides so let's put this data into context here we're looking at a meta-analysis of 61 studies and we're looking at all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of triglycerides on the x and what we can see is that all cause mortality risk significantly increases for higher levels of triglycerides now at the far left side of this curve is about 90 milligrams per deciliter so having triglycerides less than less than this amount is associated or pretty close to this amount is associated with maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk so note that all of jarahiman's data are less than 90 milligrams per deciliter which would put him at lowest all-cause mortality risk based on the analysis analysis data but we can take this a step further relatively low triglycerides may be a hallmark of longevity and the reason i say that is here's data for 11 centenarian focused studies so you can see the average age on the right each of them is older than 100 years and when we look at triglyceride levels in these centenarian studies in these 11 studies in nine of the studies triglycerides are less than 101 and in an additional study in wilcox at all 2008 third from the bottom we can see that the 109 year olds had an average triglyceride level of 93 milligrams per deciliter so we could argue that 10 of these 11 studies had triglycerides less than 101 which is closest to lowest risk for all-cause mortality based on the meta-analysis data so again jurajiman's data for triglycerides would be considered good at least for his longevity so moving right along in terms of what's good and last in this group is his hdl so let's put this data also into perspective so hdl peaks in youth as shown here the values of about 56 milligrams per deciliter and then it starts to decline in the 20s uh closer to 50 after which it's pretty pretty stable over the next uh 50 to 60 years after that with values in 88 year olds in this study of about 15.9 million people uh close to the low 50s so jirahiman's average hdl is 61.3 over those three measurements which is closer to youth than the aged value of somewhere in the low 50s now what about all-cause mortality risk so this is data from that same study and when entering jarahiman's data of 61.3 we can see that he's pretty close to lowest all-cause mortality risk which was defined in this or which was identified in this study as in the 50 to 60 milligram per deciliter range so in terms of what's good he's got relatively youthful and healthy based on the all-cause mortality data levels of hdl all right so what about creatinine and i didn't put this in the what's good or what's bad category and as we'll see it's it's going to get a grade of incomplete so why is that so superficially creatinine levels are close to optimal based on all cause mortality data at least in this study of about 31 000 people so we're looking at all-cause mortality risk plotted on the y-axis against the concentration of creatinine on the x and when entering uh jurajiman's first two data points for creatinine 0.76 and 0.83 that would put him close to the lowest risk for all-cause mortality even in his uh third measurement 0.58 he risk would start to increase as you can see the curve starts to move upwards and to the left but it would be far worse if his creatinine levels were less than 0.5 or higher than 1.5 which isn't the case here now but note that creatinine may not be a good marker of kidney function in the age so why is that so here we're looking at how creatinine levels change during aging and they're mostly stable up until the mid 60s as shown there but then creatinine levels start to significantly increase and one reason for that is because kidney function declines during aging which leads to an accumulation of creatinine in the blood as the kidneys aren't as able or as able to filter it out so that we can pee it out now con adding to the story is that muscle mass is also proportional to blood levels of creatinine as shown here so creatinine on the y axis plotted against muscle mass so as muscle mass increases because creatinine is stored within muscle blood levels of creatinine would be higher in someone who has relatively higher levels of muscle mass however muscle mass declines during aging and conversely creatinine release from muscle declines during aging so when considering these two data that create increases because of decreased kidney function uh increases because of decreased kidney function sorry but then also decreases because of decreased muscle mass we have to give creatinine a grade as incomplete as a marker of kidney function because there's no way to know if his creatinine levels are good because of bad kidney function or low muscle mass so fortunately in this paper they had two other markers of kidney function or that we can use to assess kidney function and the first one is cystin c now there was only one time point that they have data for so let's put that data into context now system c is a better marker of kidney function and i won't go into the why in this video that's a completely separate video that i'll probably make at some point so stay tuned for that but systatin c is a better marker of kidney function in the oldest old as it's less it's it's been shown to be less sensitive to changes in muscle mass so let's put his data let's put jarahiman's data into context in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk so here we're looking at statin seed levels on the y axis plotted against age and in in youth systatin seed levels are relatively low and that's indicative of good kidney function however as we can see cistatin seed levels increase during aging with relatively higher levels being associated with poor kidney function and we can see by jarrah iman's data that would put him at the far right which means that he's got aged levels of statin c and this would be indicative of poor kidney function so what about all-cause mortality risk so here we're looking at all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against survival time so about about a 20-year follow-up starting with the initial assessment of systatin c and what we can see is that people who had cystin c that were less than 0.7 milligrams per liter they had the best survival intermediate survival for people who had up to 1.08 milligrams per liter of systatency and then the worst survival was for people who had greater than 1.08 milligrams per liter for sustain c and in jarahiman's case he had 1.32 milligrams per liter at the at least when he was 115 and a half years old which would put him for highest risk for all-cause mortality based on this one biomarker so in terms of what's bad he's gerahimon's got aged and unhealthy levels of cystitis c now the other biomarker that i mentioned that can be used to assess kidney function is blood urea nitrogen bun now bun is also a marker of kidney function assuming that there isn't a change in dietary protein intake so assuming you have normal kidney function if you increase your protein intake bun there's data that bun increases proportionately as urea is formed by uh protein deamination so you're removing the amino growth from protein and reformulating it into bond now it's unlikely that uh jarrah mon changed his diet over these last four years you know dramatically increasing his protein intake so it's more likely that this is a reflection of his kidney function so let's see how blood urination change changes during aging which is shown here and if you're familiar with my channel i've presented this data before so this won't come as a surprise but bun increases during aging from values of about 13 to approaching 24 in older than 90 year olds now jurajiman's data would was even higher than the range and off the chart at his average state over those three measurements was 27.7 milligrams per deciliter so he's off to a bad start with blood urea nitrogen levels what about all-cause mortality risk so that's what's shown here has a ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the blood urea nitrogen on the x-axis the concentration of bond and what we can see from jarahiman's three data is that he's on the ascending portion of this curve which is indicative of an increase significantly increase all-cause mortality risk based on his blood urea nitrogen values so when considering his statin c and bond data we can conclude that he probably had poor kidney function over this four year period all right so what about albumin so uh 3.5 3.6 and 2.9 let's put that data into context so abdomen levels change during aging they decline during aging and note that the units on this graph are different from what's in jericho's data so to keep them the same we just divide the graph data by 10. So 4.6 uh values of albumin of 4.6 are found in youth which then declined during aging such that hundred year olds have about uh 3.6 um levels for albumin and we can see that jorah iman's data is pretty close to the age age group for argument rel relative to being youthful levels at about 4.6 so what about all-cause mortality risk well in terms of that relatively higher albumin is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk which is shown here so in this study uh there are three age groups 85 to 99 100 to 104 and people who are older than 105 years old and what we can see for each of these age groups was that the higher relatively higher levels of abdomen were associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk as shown you can see the confidence interval for albumin in each case is less than one also note that other commonly measured clinical biomarkers were evaluated for their association with all-cause mortality risk wasn't just albumin and we can see that the magnitude of the risk reduction for relatively higher levels of albumin was uh better when compared with things like hdl ldl hba1c creatinine kidney function as measured by creatinine and c-reactor protein so albumin is a pretty good biomarker relative to those other biomarkers for its association with all-cause mortality risk now conversely jirahiman didn't have relatively high levels of admin he's got relatively low levels which would put him at an increased all-cause mortality risk based on his data so from that we can conclude that he had low and unhealthy based on the all-cause mortality data levels of albumin all right so last but not least red blood cells so let's put his data into context and note that the scale on the data that i just popped up is different from his data so to convert his data we just divide his data by a hundred so he had when doing that he would have values of 3.9 4. 4.27 and 3.89 for red blood cells in contrast in youth red blood cells are about 4.8 and then they decline during aging such that people approaching 100 years old have values less than 4.0 and along those lines that's where jarahiman's data was with average values of about four for red blood cells so from that we can conclude he had age levels of red blood cells which is not indicative of youth which would be about 4.8 so to summarize uh jarajiman had youthful and or healthy levels of glucose hba1c white blood cells c-reactive protein at least up until 112 years triglycerides and hdl data for creatinine is incomplete whereas data fork systatin c and blood urine nitrogen indicate that he had poor kidney function and but he also had aged and or unhealthy levels of albumin and red blood cells so with this in mind if we regularly monitor and optimize these and other biomarkers can we live as long or even longer than jurajiman all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
