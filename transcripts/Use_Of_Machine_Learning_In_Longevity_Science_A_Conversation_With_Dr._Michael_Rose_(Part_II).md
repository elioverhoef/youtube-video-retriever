# Use Of Machine Learning In Longevity Science: A Conversation With Dr. Michael Rose (Part II)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The 55 thesis uh your website is a great segue coming going from the machine learning approach into actionable ways to extend human lifespan now right but then once the machine learning uh approach has characterized the omics of uh you know uh extreme longevity at least in drosophila and the challenge is gonna be uh and even if even if slash when that's done in humans within the next few years the challenge is gonna be uh how do you positively impact that impact that with the goal of getting significant increases in lifespan and unfortunately in the reduction of science era that we live in most studies are going to be one supplement at a time and if you propose multi-ingredient formulations probably it'll get that or rejected in review so there what do you think about the technical hurdles in terms of going from characterizing the phenotype of comprehensive characterization of the phenotype of aging into now using the similar machine learning approach to uh get dramatic increases in in health and lifespan okay so there's an intermediate step that i think is available in this decade um you can use all the same tools um in order to properly characterize what supplements or pharmaceuticals are doing and as you know full well the only real difference between a supplement in the pharmaceutical is its legal status right so [music] basically any given supplement of pharmaceutical is going to have effects that are as complicated as the effects of experimental evolution um and evidence to that effect has been accumulating over the last 20 years since we got good genomic and nc transfer generic tools um there is no simplicity to be found even if you are doing one substance in interventions um all through the 20th century [music] you know biology was the science of the math phobic except for my fields which are evolutionary quantum genetics which is where those of us who like math that's how we do our biology we do it with math and serious math not trivial math um well it turns out that in the 20th century this kind of uh kindergarten for biology where biologists got away with doing the simplest experiments they could give you interpretable results which are great you know for genetic diseases um when you do have one or a few major pathways that are colossally screwed up but as soon as you step away from that to most people's chronic aging associated disorders thus aging itself you're dealing with a whole world of painful complexity which only people with my background really enjoy um unfortunately genomics arrived uh at the end of the 20th century start of the 21st century and qualitatively blew up the game for the reductionists who wanted to study anything more complicated than genetic diseases or you know the consequences of simple pathogens like viruses um so even though the reductionists are low to admit it and even though they dominate nih in large waves of nsf they're dead they're just scientifically in technology for dead in the water they're floating face down you know like william holden started sensitive [music] it's over for them and you know like the uh heliocentric um talmaic astronomers in the 17th century the century of galileo newton they are not accepting their obsolescence with any great grace magnanimity or care for the welfare of their fellow human they are fighting tooth and nail against the destruction of productionism but reductionism is being destroyed with every good genomic transcriptomic and metabolic publication because they all show complexity and the beauty of it is people like myself alex trevorenko a whole bunch of other people are just you know we're not hanging around the funeral the reductionist room just moving on and we're using machine learning tools to try to parse that complexity and find ways forward um and that that's where the action is going to be um so even with the machine learning based approach and i'm 100 on board i've been thinking about that for the longest time too so even with the machine learning based approach let's say you've got a big study of thousands of hundreds of thousands or more people and you use machine learning ai based approach to come up with a set of parameters that could potentially extend health and lifespan in that cohort at the end of the day though for the average person they still would have to use the machine learning based approach using some computational tools to predict if that if this you know what worked in that big study would work for them based on their genetics their environment et cetera so so now there are two layers involved it's machine learning at the big you know the macros the macro and then down to the individual because if the individual is just gonna hey it worked in that study that's what it they came up with and they're just gonna take it based on faith it could do more harm than good right so okay okay so uh i have two i think important but straightforward things to say about that the first thing is people do this kind of machine learning interaction every day when you use google search you are using a very carefully constructed set of machine learning tools that deal with vast amounts of complexity in in less than a second in order to address the individual concerns of individual people okay so people whether they realize it or not are interfacing with gigantic databases and very powerful machine learning tools when you you know looking to buy an item on amazon you're doing the same stuff okay so whether people look under the hood or not your lives are totally entangled with machine learning tools so all we're doing is is extending them into the realm of biology even though the vast majority of professional biologists about their phds before 2000 hate it i mean they're not neutral about it they hate it because it's just not how they were trained in how biology should be done because you know frankly they whenever evolutionary geneticists or quantitations to begin with whereas a lot of the tools that um genomicists use are back-end uh quantitative genetics tools so the g-wise is a kind of quantitative genetics type of analytic so the first thing is you know the future is of technologies including biological technologies will be dominated by machine learning that's just a fact and people who can't accept it can't really be that effective in the 21st century the second thing i would say is i'm not really fond of the idea of people sitting at home with their laptop googling a supplement and saying well gee how much of this random supplement that somebody published in japan based on the study of using the supplement on 12 inbred mice uh compared to you know eight in red mice 12 on the supplement eight not on a supplement and the 12 on the supplement lived you know three months longer i'm not fond of that kind of uh biomedical intervention i have any number of friends and acquaintances who do that routinely um a number of them have died because i've known these people for more than 30 years um i have never seen any really obvious substantial benefits according to them i was saying was the big the big uh you know even though machine learning is definitely going to identify uh supplements you know that can extend life lifespan in big cohorts and i get the idea that machine learning is ubiquitous in our lives it's everywhere now but if i wanna if i wanna you know if i have my own blood test data and i wanna use a machine learning approach to identify the best panel of supplement that will extend my health and vigor and all those things it doesn't exist yet i don't know when it will exist i can only hope that it will exist sometime in the near future but okay okay so i have a confession to make so on the order of 10 years ago i proposed to the company that i then worked for geneseon that they create such an online interface for people exactly like you use um and i no longer think that's a good idea why um so so 10 years ago i was literally trying to create utopia from my floss garden you know because you're one of the few people you're sort of the dream client for that website uh because of your experience and your dedication of innocent data um uh i now know a lot more than i knew them and uh to be fairly candid with you i think it takes the resources of a pharma company to do a good job of going from omic data to um recommendations for supplement use or pharmaceutical use for that matter i think the use of pharmaceuticals for aging associated diseases right now is pretty much barbaric um the lack of appropriate use of relatively obtainable information about the genomes and transcriptomies of patients uh is a travesty i think that that is one of the most important growth areas of medicine if i may be very like uh if i may view the biomedical establishment from an altitude like the orbit of the moon um you have basic ohmic research which of course is going to depend more and more on machine learning because it's too damn complicated to make progress out of the way you can't find a result for one site in a genome or one transcript and transfer term and invent a verbal story and go from there to a pharmaceutical it's ridiculous but machine learning can take you through the um layers and guide you and that's the work of omissists aided by machine learning people and of course that's a big you know activity right now in the world more and more companies are doing exactly what i just described you don't go from those companies to individuals in my opinion you go from those companies to big pharma or moderate moderate-sized farmer and then you go from them to you know you don't even go to individual physicians you go to major healthcare providers like the nhs kaiser permanente and you have their biomedical scientists interacting with the pharma companies interacting with the big omic databases and ai servers to knit a very big challenging arc of technologies together that's how i now think 10 years later because i have the benefit of 10 additional years of very powerful and machine learning research with my colleagues so that that whole umbrella uh you know of of collaboration is going to take time that's not something that can develop you know quickly and not just that it's um you know once with data there becomes interpretation of the data and even with machine learning you know you're gonna have an interpretation of your output right so even there you know there may be three or four different roads that lead to the same health health or lifespan extension and then it becomes i hear what you're saying in terms of the you know the different companies you know uh giving you the ability to use the machine learning the individual the ability to use the machine learning approach but uh not not to sound cynical but when you look at the at least the american health care system and how literally you know f that is uh now you're going to have a group of companies who won't let me do my own analysis but i have to follow what their analysis is and hope that their methods which may or may not be published uh are going to actually leave me on the right path so separately uh separately from that uh in terms of the uh just along the way i'll just comment mike that i totally accept your concerns yeah like i but i'm like you said i'm a different breed you know i want to be able to run analyses myself do the interpretation myself so that i can actually then make you know uh this reasonable decision or not right as opposed to leaving it in the hands of well you know better than you you know and i don't know so for many people maybe that's the case they'll appreciate that but i'm in a different boat okay okay let me just stop you there yep all right um so one of the reasons why i dropped the idea that i had 10 years ago which was you know google for multiple starting and people not as good as you but aspiring to be as quick was i came up with a different short-term bridge which is uh the age and ancestry appropriate tuning of diet and lifestyle
