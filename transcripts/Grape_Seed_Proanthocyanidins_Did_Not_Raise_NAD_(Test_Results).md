# Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins Did Not Raise NAD (Test Results)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that grape seed proanthocyanidins increase nad in this study which was done in rats we can see that the highest proanthocyanidine content of 50 milligrams per kilogram increased liver levels of nad by about four-fold similarly in a study that was done in middle-aged mice 18 months old 18m when these mice were fed grape seed proanthocyanide and extract gspe we can see about a three-fold increase for plasma levels of nad however no human studies have yet tested the ability of grape seed paranthocyanidins to impact nad levels so with that in mind for nad test number six i sent blood to ginfinity for analysis and if you're interested in measuring your own levels of nad there'll be a discount link in the video's description so there the hypothesis was if i supplement with grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins will that raise my nad and i wish i could say that it could or did but it didn't grapeseed powder did not raise my nad as we can see 19.9 micromolar is my lowest nad reading over the over these six tests now to to note how much grapeseed powder that i was taking it was 6.1 grams per day and i did this experiment for 19 days and note that in the last video i showed published amounts of grape seed proanthocyanin content in grape seeds and based on the lowest amount which is about 107 milligrams per gram of grape seed i took in about 648 milligrams of promethocyanins at the lowest it could be higher but that's based on published values for how much is in grape seed now just using the rat study as an example the human equivalent dose for that study for that four-fold increase in nad was about 536 milligrams of grapeseed paranthocyanidines so technically i should have at least seen some bump or some increase in nad but i didn't so with that in mind what's next i've used enemn in the past but for the next test i'm going to use niacin and why i'm going to go with niacin besides cost i'll cover that in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing and telomere testing which is also included in that test or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyfox health and note that their biomarker panel is mostly different from the at-home metabolomics and also includes apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatrine brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
