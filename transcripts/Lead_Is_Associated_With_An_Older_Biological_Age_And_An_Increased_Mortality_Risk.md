## Transcript

Blood levels of lead negatively impact many organ systems including the brain cardiovascular kidney liver bone and reproductive organs in addition relatively high blood levels of lead are associated with an older biological age and an increased all cause mortality risk and we covered some of that story in last week's video where we looked at which biomarkers are associated with an older biological age and that's when looking at the panel of biomarkers shown here so to the far right we can see blood levels of lead more specifically for a one standard deviation increase for blood lead levels relative to the average level in this study that was significantly associated with a close to 5y older biological age in addition that finding was in the same ballpark as other classic markers that are associated with an older biological age including glucose and hba1c levels in addition relatively higher lead levels are also associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here with data for women and for men and note that this is a relatively large study which included almost 26,000 people so on the x- axis we've got all cause mortality risk risk of death for all causes and then on the y- axis we've got metal levels and i didn't just include data for lead which is pb the chemical symbol for lead is pb but also cadmium and mercury for comparison so what we we can see is that in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one remember where the 95% confidence interval when that's the horizontal line to the left and right of these squares the black squares when that's completely to the right of one or completely to the left of one we have a significant association so we can see that for lead that this is a significant association for both women and men in other words relatively higher blood levels of lead are associated with a 48% increased risk of death for all causes in women and a 22% increased risk in men but interestingly and this is potentially a story for another video we can also see that's true for cadmium levels as relatively higher blood levels of cadmium are associated with a 28% higher risk of death for all causes in women and a 39% risk of death from all causes in men all right so what about mercury there's a lot of concern about eating fish as fish can contain mercury and we don't want to have relatively high levels of mercury in our blood because it may be bad for health at least in this study and i haven't done a deep dive to see how blood mercury levels associate with all cause mortality risk in other studies but in this study we can see that it's 95% confidence interval again the horizontal line to the left and right of the black squares they completely overlap with one in both women and men so the association for mercury with all cause mortality risk is not significally associated uh either in women or or men with blood levels of mercury now it's important to note that this study had a relatively young cohort that was 46 years old an average age of 46 that had a 7-year median follow followup which is relatively short so what about looking at the association for lead with all cause mortality risk and studies that had a longer followup and that's what we'll see in this study which had people of about the same age 44 years it's relatively large more than 14,000 people but this time we've got it median 19-year followup on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio so that's the risk of death for all causes and in parenthesis you see it says 95% ci that's the 95% conf confidence interval in this case that's the shaded gray region on the plot so if that's completely above a hazard ratio of one we have a significant association so on the x-axis we've got the concentration of lead in blood and in terms of what's significant we put up that red line at the hazard ratio of one and we can see that lowest all cause mortality risk is associated with blood lead levels of8 microg per deciliter and then for all values higher than that there was a significantly increased risk of death for all causes so in terms of what's optimal for blood lead levels it would appear that less than 8 micrograms per deciliter is the target so the good news is we don't have to just follow studies in other people and hope that we have relatively low levels of lead in our blood they can be quantified so at this this point in videos like this i generally ask what's my data so i haven't measured it yet that's on the to-do list on the plan on the test plan list for blood test number six in 2024 which i've scheduled for september 3rd of this year now for all of the tests in 2024 i've been using ulta lab test so i don't go to my physician to have tests done as that's generally been a headache and i've got to basically beg them to do this test or that test problem solved so when when i use this website ulta lab test which uses quest diagnostics i can order exactly the tests that i want i bring them to the lab in this case which is quest i pay a $10 blood draw fee and then i get the results relatively quickly for blood test number five i got uh most of the results within one business day so if you want to help support the channel there's an affiliate link i've got it uh posted here but i'll also put that in the videos description all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification or microbiome composition at home uh blood testing including metabolomics which includes more than 600 metabolites at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob but also uh the dna epigenetic test grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trang brand as i've got on here and as i wear all the time that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
