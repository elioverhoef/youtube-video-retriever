# hsCRP: What's Optimal, Which Factors May Reduce It?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

High sensitivity c reactor protein or hscrp increases during aging and that's what we can see here with levels of crp on the y-axis plotted against age starting with 18 year olds on the left all the way up through people who are older than 70 on the right in youth average crp levels are 0.8 milligrams per liter and then we can see the age-related increase such that people who are older than 70 have average crp values that are doubled at 1.6 milligrams per liter now the age-related increase for crp is potentially important because a relatively higher crp or level of crp is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and that's we can see here this is a meta-analysis of 27 studies that included more than 480 000 people for the association between all cause mortality risk with hscrp now in terms of what's significant we put up the dash thread line at a hazard ratio of 1 and note that when the dashed black lines that's the 95 percent confidence interval when that's completely above or below one we have a statistically significant association now in this case we can see that that's true for crp that's greater than one milligram per liter so as crp increases we can see that increased association for all cause mortality risk now in youth you can see that the upper limit of the range for crp is about one milligram per per liter which then raises the question is less than one milligram per liter optimal for hscrp so for that we go back to the all-cause mortality plot more specifically within the zero to one milligram per liter range and there we can see that hscrp does indeed increase above zero up until the one milligram per liter range and that's a significant increase as you can see that both of the dash black lines are completely above one in other words for all cause mortality risk as close to zero as possible may be optimal for hscrp now with these data in mind what can reduce hscrp so first let's take a look at which foods are significantly correlated with lower levels of hscrp and as a quick side step in terms of looking at food correlations with hscrp let's detail the approach that i'm going to go through in this video so every day since april of 2015 i've weighed all of my food prior to intake using a food scale i then entered that data into chronometer and if you're interested in using chronometer there'll be a discount link in the video's description and then because each blood test since 2015 has a corresponding average diet composition i can then calculate correlations for diet including macro and micronutrients and individual foods with blood biomarkers i then alter my diet with the goal of improving the blood biomarkers and then after each blood test i recalculate these correlations and then starting the process over increasing certain foods decreasing certain foods based on how the correlations look all right so with the with these data in mind which foods are significantly correlated with lower hscrp now in my data that happens to be turmeric but as a quick again side step note that although i've weighed all of my food since 2015 i only started tracking hscrp in 2018 so i have 27 blood tests over that five plus year span for uh hscrp versus food intake so the strongest correlation is with turmeric and that's what we can see here more specifically we can see that a relatively higher intake of turmeric average daily tumeric intake is significantly correlated with lower hscrp now in terms of how i get that turmeric into my diet i use ground powder and uh in that's in contrast with the whole food more close to the whole food which is the turmeric root for some reason eating the root tastes like soap to me and ruins anything that it's in whereas using the powder i add that to cook meals and it doesn't ruin the food it actually helps with taste and texture all right so this is just one example and arguably this is the strongest correlation for foods with lower hsc or pmi data what about other foods are they significantly correlated with hscrp and that's we can see here this is a the list for foods that are anomaly significant that's a p-value lesson 0.05 that are significantly correlated with lower hscrp and for those that are gonna say i haven't calculated a false discovery rate this is true i don't want to exclude any data because i don't know if any of these foods are actually causing lower hscrp so i try to follow as much of the data as possible and by including a false discovery rate i may be excluding data thereby limiting my ability to potentially lower hscrp so when considering these associations with or sorry correlations with lower hscrp i keep my intake of them relatively high and for those who want the exact amounts i'll put the link to the video for my diet composition in in terms of the exact amounts for these foods in the right corner now conversely in terms of foods that are correlated with lower crp there are also foods in my data that are significantly correlated with higher cip as shown here so with that in mind the goal here is to minimize intake so with this approach in mind try to increase foods or keep relatively high foods that are significantly correlated with lower crp and minimize foods that are significantly correlated with higher crp in support of that approach for the last 10 blood tests my crp levels have been less than the the detection limit quest detection limit which is 0.3 milligrams per liter so that would suggest that i'm on the i'm on the right track for using this approach now food intake may not be the only thing that's potentially impacting if correlation equals causation hscrp in my data so which other factors may be impacting hscrp and in my case a higher daily heart rate not the resting heart rate but the higher heart rate for the full day higher average daily heart rate is significantly correlated with hscrp in my data and that's what we can see here so i only had the idea to start tracking the average daily heart rate even though i've worn a fitness tracker as shown there since 2018 i only had that idea in 2020 so this is three plus years of data and this is average daily heart rate data for 19 blood tests 19 hscrp blood tests and there we can see a significant positive correlation in other words when there's more activity more physical activity and more stress because stress uh including emotional or work stress can impact the daily heart rate too when there's more of that in between blood tests that's significantly correlated with a higher hscrp conversely when there's relatively lower levels of activity and or stress in between blood tests the next blood test is more likely to have a lower hscrp at least based on this correlation so when considering these data it suggests that for me to minimize hscrp that suggests an optimal training activity and or stress that you know again because stress can impact the daily heart rate of 55 to 57 beats per minute as the full day average daily heart rate uh to put that into perspective my average resting heart rate rhr and that's for the month of may in 2023 was 42.6 beats per minute which suggests that going 12 to 14 beats per minute above my daily heart rate may be optimal for keeping hscrp low and i don't know if it's turmeric i don't know if it's by minimizing activity while still trying to maximize fitness but that's the story for hscrp but it also raises another question is the amount of physical activity that optimizes fitness different from the amount that may optimize longevity i can definitely train more and when considering that that's associated or that's significantly correlated with higher hscrp that may not be good for systemic health conversely if i under train that may not be good for fitness while potentially being good for hscrp so what's that dose that can optimize physical fitness but then also maximize blood biomarkers and potentially longevity more on that in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing using cyfox health and note that their panel is different from the at-home metabolomics so they are complementary measures diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other discount links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
