Can fasting extend lifespan without calorie restriction it can and it was shown in this paper daily fasting improves health and survival in male mice independent of diet composition and calories now note that this data is in male mice if anyone's come across this data in females i'd be happy to present it just please leave it in the comments and i i'll be happy to present it in a future video so let's jump into the data and start off with survival so on the y-axis we've got percent survival which is how many mice were alive or how many were dead and then age or lifespan in weeks now this data is on the nia national institute of aging diet and i'll get into the diet composition a little bit later in this video and then we've got three groups of mice the first group is the ad lib group these are mice that had all-day access to food and they were not calorie restricted so the parentheses is how many mice were in that group so we can see 45 mice in the group and that's important for life because for lifespan studies you want to have a lot of mice in each group to potentially detect a significant effect and i may have more on the size of the amount of mice in each group in future videos when comparing lifespan uh interventions or interventions aimed at increasing increasing lifespan all right for the second group we've got uh the blue line which is a single meal feeding mf these mice were fed once daily and were not intended to be calorie restricted and then the last group is another group that was also fed once daily but was 30 calorie restricted 30 cr so let's take a look at 50 survival this is the time when half the colony has has died and half is still alive and when compared with the ad lib uh median survival as shown there with the black line so for the single meal feeding group in blue we can see that there's a rightward shift which suggests an increased lifespan so to see if that's significant we can go to the stats we can go to the numbers so here we can see that the diet was the nia diet the feeding we can see our three groups with the n number of animals per group and then we go to lifespan analysis median survival and then we can see that the ad-lib group had a median survival of about 104 weeks and then the group that was fed once once per day but that was not intended to be calorie restricted had an 18 and a half percent increased median lifespan when compared with ad lib significantly increased median lifespan all right what about 75 survival so we can see that there with the dashed line and then we can also see another rightward shift which suggests an increased uh 75 survival so 75 of the colony had died 25 was still alive and then when compared with ad-lib we can see again that there was a significant increase for the group that was fed once per day for 75 survival so from this we can conclude that for the majority of the lifespan survival was increased for the single meal feeding group that was not intended to be calorie restricted when compared with the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted all right so what about calories work calories actually uh different when comparing the single meal feeding group versus the ad lib so that's where we can see here and this is food consumed on the y-axis in kilocalories kcal per day per mouse so the two groups the two lines we're interested in looking at for now are the black line which is the ad lib food intake and the blue line which is a single meal feeding group and we can see that they basically overlap at least by looking at the food consumed there with weeks on diet on the x-axis but when we look at the actual amounts of calories that were consumed by each mouse on each diet we can see that the ad lib group ate an average of 14 calories per day per mouse and for the single meal feeding group they consume 13.2 calories per day per mouse so when you divide 13.2 by 14 it looks like that's about a six percent calorie restriction and that's important that these mice may have been calorie restricted because single meal feeding plus calorie restriction extends lifespan and we can see that with the red line so before getting to into that data with the red line here in terms of food consume we can see that the cr group the red line ate calories per day per mouse which is a 32 cr now in terms of survival we can see a dramatic rightward shift for the cr group that that was fed once per day not just for median survival shown there which was a 35 percent increase for median survival for the calorie restricted group but also 75 survival was also significantly increased for the calorie-restricted group that was fed only once per day so what about the fasting interval how long did the mice that were fed once per day and calorie restricted mice both of the single meal feeding groups how long was their daily fast so we can see that here this is going to be the average time to eat all the food with time on the y-axis the average time to eat it all on the y-axis axis plotted against both groups mf and cr the single meal feeding groups so we can see that the mf group that was fed once per day they ate all of their food in 15 hours so they fasted for nine hours and in contrast the calorie restriction group ate all of their food much faster within five hours and then fasted for 19 hours so to summarize this for the single meal feeding group that was not intended to be cr there was they had a similar calorie intake to ad lib but again note that this may be a possible mild cr of about six percent but they also had a nine hour fast and that was associated with an increased lifespan so what about diet composition and then that brings us to uh the next question too was lifespan extended for single meal feeding on a different diet now if you can reproduce this effect on a different diet that would suggest that fasting without cr may indeed increase lifespan so we'll get into the diet composition uh in this data here when looking at the different diet which is the wisconsin diet or wis diet so in terms of composition the wis diet was 13 protein 24 fat and then a very large percentage of calories from sugars simple sugars more specifically that s is sucrose so 46 of the wiss diet was simple sugars or sucrose now the diet that i just showed survival data for the nia diet in contrast was a little bit higher in protein a little bit lower in fat but a lot lower in sucrose so these are in many ways different uh different diets in terms of composition and that's what we can see here so the whis whisk diet they had a lot higher sugar in the content in the diet in terms of sucrose higher fat but lower protein when compared with the nia diet all right so what about survival on the wis diet and we can see that here so now again we've got our three groups what with different colors the ad lib group so again they had all-day food access and not intended to be cr and then the mf group single meal feeding fed once daily not intended to be cr and then the calorie restriction group which was also fed once daily and was 30 cr so what was the effect on survival so we go right to median survival half the colony died half is still alive and when compared with ad-lib we can see that the green curve the green so the the animals that were fed once per day that were not intended to bcr there's a rightward shift which suggests an increased lifespan so to see if that's significant or not we go to the numbers and now we can see that the diet is the west diet we can see the three groups uh for feeding with the n how many animals per group and we can see this is a you know more than 100 animals total this is 140 plus animals for the three groups combined so it's a very large study which is a good thing all right so lifespan analysis median survival when compared with ad lib which lived about 108 weeks on the wise diet we can see that there's a seven percent increased median lifespan for single meal feeding when compared with ad lib so what about 75 survival so we go to that line there and then we can also see a rightward shift for the single meal feeding group that was not attended to bcr on the west diet and when comparing the stats we can again see that there was a significant increase in 75 survival for the group that was fed once per day that was not intended to bcr so for again for the second uh time now for the majority of the lifespan survival was increased for the mf group when compared with ad lib so what about calorie intake on these three different groups so we we can see that here we go back to the food concer sorry food con consumed on the y axis and again this is calories per day per mouse on average and now the curves that we're going to compare are purple for ad-lib and green for the single meal feeding that was not intended to be cr so again they look like they overlap when looking at them just graphically but what about what about the actual food amounts so ad lib consumed 13.1 calories per day per mouse and now for the mf group on the whisk diet they consume 12.9 which is a much less and probably indistinguishable from the ad-lib diet so this from this data it would it would suggest that single meal feeding without calorie restriction extends lifespan on the whisk diet now note that the largest lifespan increase was for single meal feeding plus calorie restriction and so first how much food did the cr group eat on the whisk diet we can see 9.2 calories per day per mouse this is a 29.8 percent cr and then in terms of lifespan first median survival we can see a hundred 137 weeks versus 108 for the ad lib and then also significant increase for the 75 survival for the single meal feeding plus cr so the longest lifespan effect single meal feeding plus cr but also a significant increase in lifespan for single meal feeding without cr the green lines all right so what was the fasting interval for the mice on the whisk diet and again this is the average time to eat all the food so for the single meal feeding group that was not cr in this case on the west diet they ate all their food in 12 hours so they had a 12 hour fast and then the cr group ate all of their food even faster than on the nia diet in this case they ate it all in one hour and then fasted for the remaining 23 hours so to summarize the single meal feeding group that was not attended to bcr on the wisc diet they had a similar calorie intake to ad lib and also in conjunction with a 12 hour fast this was associated with an increased lifespan now the impact impact of fasting without calorie restriction on lifespan can be best visualized by pooling the data from both studies from the wisd diet and the nia diet so that's we can see here this is the average of both diets and again we've got our three groups ad lib now combined in black the single meal feeding groups that were not intended to be cr in blue and the calorie restriction 30 calorie restriction again single meal feeding in red so let's go to 50 and 75 survival we can see that the pool data for the single meal feeding group that was not intended to bcr had significant without showing the actual numbers in the study these were significant increases for both 50 and 75 survival so also note that the single meal feeding group their average fasting time was about 11 hours per day so prolonged fasting we could also this data also suggests that prolonged fasting without calorie restriction extends lifespan but note that the largest lifespan extending effect was shown there for 30 cr plus an even longer fasting window so and that in that case the fasting window was an average of about 21 hours so 30 cr plus a longer fast 21 hours further extends lifespan is shown by shown by the red arrows at 50 and 70 survival so to summarize and just with this you know cartoon we've got eating time at the top feeding regimen at the top and then whether or not it extended lifespan on the on the far right so starting with the ad lib group that had free access to food and could eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted this had the worst lifespan or the shortest lifespan and then for the meal fed a single meal feeding group that ate all of their food with within an average of 13 hours and fasted for 11 hours they had a significant increase in lifespan when compared with ad lib but the longest lifespan of them all was the cr group 30 cr that ate all their food with uh within within an average of three hours and then fasted for the remaining 21 hours and we can see by the lifespan extending effect with a double plus there all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging
