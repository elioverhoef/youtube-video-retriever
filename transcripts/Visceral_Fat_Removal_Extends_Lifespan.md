# Visceral Fat Removal Extends Lifespan

## Transcript

To start today's video let's take a look at data for people who have the same bmi but different levels of visceral fat and that's what we can see here with the top and bottom images so first starting with subcutaneous fat this is the fat that's located just just beneath the skin subcutaneous we can see that the person at the bottom has a bit less subcutaneous fat than the person at the top but what about visceral fat so visceral fat is the fat that surrounds organs and for the person at the bottom as highlighted in yellow we can see that the person at the bottom has very little visceral fat in contrast the person at the top has a lot of visceral fat so why is that important so as we'll see coming up surgical visceral fat removal at least in rats extends median and maximum lifespan so before jumping into the survival curves it's important to show some of the details for that for that study for this study so visceral fat was surgically removed when the rats were 5 months old and then at 20 months old how much visceral fat was present and that's important because this is a longevity study so if they remove the visceral fat at at youth and then the visceral fat grew back then we really can't assess the effect of visceral fat removal on longevity if most of it you know accumulated over time so there were three groups in this study a group that had their visceral fat removed but was allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted the group that ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted ad lib or al and then cr more specifically 40% cr so how much visceral fat was present in these three groups for the group that had their visceral fat removed they had about 9 g left and this is 15 months after the surgical visceral fat removal so visceral fat didn't necessarily increase or didn't increase much 15 months later as we'll see uh in a bit then the ad lib group had about three times higher three times higher level of visceral fat when compared with the group that had their visceral fat removed and we you can see that that's significantly different because the superscripts are different b and a respectively for the ad lib and visceral fat removed groups but what about ncr how much visceral fat was there so they had 5.9 gr of visceral fat and interestingly we can see that the amount of visceral fat in the cr rats was not significantly different from the group that had their visceral fat surgically removed but the surgical removal group was allowed to eat as much as they wanted and we can see those effects illustrated in body measurements so when looking at body weight for the two groups that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they whenever they wanted we can see that body weight and ad lib and vf remove were not significantly different as their supers scripts are the same but both of the groups that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted had a higher body weight than cal restricted rats so to summarize this for the group that had their visceral fat removed they had a similar level of visceral fat at 20 months of age to rats that were on cr but body weight was not different when compared with the ad lib group so in other words if visceral fat impacts lifespan it's they may be doing it without calorie restriction all right so let's go back to the data in terms of the surgical vf removal extends median and maximum lifespan and that's what we can see here on the y- axis we've got percent survival plotted against age in weeks and then for median and maximal survival we'll take a look at 50% and 80% survival this this is the time or these are the times when half the colony has died 50% survival and 80% of the colony has died 20% survival and for both of those time points we can see that the visceral fat removal group had significant extensions for both median and maximal lipan but they don't have the longest lipan on this curve we can see that's reserved for calorie restriction now where i think the story is most interesting is that cal restriction reduces visceral fat as i showed earlier the group the cr group had the lowest amount of visceral fat it wasn't surgically removed so when considering that the visceral fat surgical removal group had about a 20% lifespan extension both median and maximal it it suggests suggests that at least 20% of the lifespan extending effect of calor restriction in rats may be due to uh limiting visceral fat accumulation with age all right so these data are in rats what's optimal for visceral fat in people and for that we'll take a look at visceral fat accumulation during aging as it increases during aging with those plots for women shown on the left and for men shown on the right on the y- ais we've got vfm or visceral fat mass plotted against age from 20 to about 90 years and for both women and men we can see that median values of visceral fat increase during aging now the slopes of these red lines may not seem very high but to put the data into context to put this into numbers so average visceral fat or median visceral fat for a 20-year-old woman is about 200 gram whereas for a 70-year-old woman it's about 1,000 gram so it's a five-fold increase similarly for men in a 20-year-old median values for visceral fat are about 500 gram and for a 70-year-old it's about four times higher at 2,000 gr so we can see the visceral fat increases during aging and not by small amounts 4 to 5x higher than in 20-year-olds so in terms of the long vity goal it's to keep visceral fat relatively low and avoid its age related increase so with that in mind i i try to practice what i preach what's my data so uh earlier or late last year in december of 2023 i had dexa performed full body dexa which assesses body composition including levels of visceral fat as shown here we can see that that was a december 20th 20 2023 test my chronological age was around 51 years and my visceral fat mass was5 8 lb which is 263 g now where does that number uh where where can we put that number into context for the curve on the right or for the plot on the right so my chronological age we can see that that's below average which is a good thing because we want to have visceral fat be relatively low if visceral fat in people can indeed result in an extended lifespan and we can see that it's below average as highlighted by that green green arrow there now where my current levels of visceral fat r would be low for any age so i can't i can't say that it's the levels of a 20-year-old but it could be the levels anywhere from a 20-year-old to a 50-year-old so the goal is to keep visceral fat uh low for as long as i physically can and let's see if it'll impact longevity all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sfox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chon meter or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
