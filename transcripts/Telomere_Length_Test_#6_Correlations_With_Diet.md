# Telomere Length Test #6: Correlations With Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Telomere length declines during aging and that's what we can see here with data from men and women on the y-axis we've got ltl or leukocyte telomere length so telomere length in white blood cells plotted against age on the x within the age range of about 20 to 100 years old and then we can see the age-related decline for telomere length such that in youth telomere length is about 7.75 kilobases or kb and an advanced age it's about 5.75 kilobases now the age-related decline for telomere length is potentially important because relatively longer telomeres are associated with a decreased risk for the incidence of alzheimer's disease and alzheimer's disease related dementia and that's we can see here on the y-axis we've got the cumulative incident risk for ad alzheimer's disease or ad related dementia plotted against time with an average follow-up time of 12 years after the initial assessment of telomere length and then there were six different telomere lengths and look note that the actual amount in kilobases wasn't reported in the study unfortunately so we only have relative or relative comparisons from short to long telomeres so when compared with people who had relatively short telomeres as telomere length increased we can see significant decreases for ad and ad related dementia incident risk as shown here as telomere length increase we can see that risk significantly decreased so with that in mind what's my data and more specifically which factors may impact telomere length and i mean that outside of the published studies and other people what may impact it in my own n of one data so first in terms of what's my data in 2022 i've measured telomere length three times and note that these data are generated with true diagnostic and they'll be a discount link for those who are interested in measuring their own telomere length in the video's description so over those first three tests my average telomere length was 7.04 kilobases and if you remember what telomere length looks like in youth it's 7.75 kilobases so based on my 22 2022 average i have some work to do based on telomere length so for the first two tests in 2023 there was some progress 7.13 kilobases on the first two tests and then for test number six which was in april of 2023 we can see that telomere length was 7.15 kilobases such that the average of these three tests in 2023 is 7.14 kilobases now when comparing these two groups of data the three tests in 2022 versus the three tests in 2023 with a two sample t-test the 2023 data is significantly longer or significantly better than 20 2022 now note that i'm not taking this data too seriously it's only six tests each group only has three three data points so it's it's good progress so or it's going in the right direction so hopefully i can continue this lengthening of telomere length even by a little bit and resisting the age-related decline all right so which factors may impact telomere length and for me i think the most important factor may be calorie intake so over these six tests we can see how telomere length correlates with calorie intake with telomere length on the y-axis plotted against my average daily calorie intake on the x and note that the average daily calorie intake is from the day of the previous test to the day before the most recent test so that average average daily calorie intake corresponds then to that blood test for telomere length and i've done that six times and i do that for every blood test in order to look at correlations for a diet with blood biomarkers so when looking at the correlation we can see that it's inverse in other words when calorie intake has been relatively high telomere length has been relatively low and conversely a relatively lower calorie intake is significantly correlated with a longer telomere length in my data which then raises the question what will happen if i can go lower for my average daily calorie intake so what about diet more specifically how does calorie intake relate to diet which components or do any components of diet relate to telomere length so first let's take a look at food significantly correlated with longer telomere length and we can see that list here and then this let's go through what's actually included in this table so first the little r is the correlation coefficient and we can see that each of them is positive which means that a relatively higher intake of each of these foods is significantly correlated with a longer telomere length and when i say significantly correlated we can see that the p-value is less than 0.05 in each of these cases now for those who are interested in adjusting for multiple comparisons i did not do that because that will probably throw away some data which may actually be involved in mechanisms related to telomere length and because i don't know which may be a true positive or a false positive i don't want to throw away any data all right so then for each food i have an average intake range over the six tests and then my intake for the last test now i don't know if any of these foods are causative in terms of impacting telomere length so eating at the high end of my range for each of these foods may be beneficial in terms of potentially impacting telomere lane so let's see if that's been true just using it as an example without going through everything on the list four olives so olives my intake range has been 0.3 to 2.1 grams per day over these six tests so when considering the significant positive correlation for olives with telomere length that suggests that eating at the high end of my range may be beneficial and we can see that on the last test or corresponding to the last test olive intake was 2.1 grams so i indeed was at the high end of my intake range for olives and if you look at all the foods i'm generally following that trend with the exception of mushrooms which at 273 grams per day isn't 299 but it is higher than my lowest intake of 227. Now what about foods that are significantly correlated with shorter telomere length and that list is shown here so again just breaking it down the r in this case all of them are negative so these are foods that a relatively higher intake is significantly correlated with a shorter telomere length and we can see that in each in each case the p-value is less than 0.05 so it's nominally statistically significant and then again we've got the intake range and the last test amount so in contrast with the previous data the low end of my range in terms of intake for these foods may be beneficial for telomere length so let's see how well or not that i've been doing with that so just using cacao beans as an example we can see that my intake range was over the six tests was five to about 10 grams per day so based on the significant inverse correlation that would suggest that eating towards the lower end of my range may be beneficial for telomere length and we can see that on my last test it indeed was at the lower end of my range 5.2 grams so for most of these foods i'm following the correlations eating at the low end of my range for these significant inverse correlations with telomere length dates could be a little bit lower to get closer to the low end of the range and similarly soak in corn but corn is a big you know there's a big difference for corn for 87.5 or 82 grams versus my highest intake about 230 grams so i'm following pretty close to following that correlation too now if diet does have an impact on telomere length following as many correlations as possible would be expected to optimize telomere length and that's what i'm doing for both the foods that are positively and negatively correlated so will this approach yield further improved improvements for telomere length telomere length test number seven is scheduled for tomorrow so stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
