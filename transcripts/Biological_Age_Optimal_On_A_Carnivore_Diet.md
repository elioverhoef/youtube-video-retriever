# Biological Age: Optimal On A Carnivore Diet?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Is biological age optimal on a carnivore diet so to address that question i'm going to examine paul saladino who's a medical doctor so we're going to analyze his blood test results so he posted his blood test data while being on the carnivore diet on in his show note showed show notes for when he went on joe rogan's podcast so i've uh i reviewed his data and these are his data uh for uh albumin creatinine glucose c-reactor protein percentage of lymphocytes mean red cell volume red cell distribution with alkaline phosphatase white blood cells age and those variables uh enter into a biological age calculator known as uh phenotypic age uh give him a score of 39.59 years now that's 3.4 years younger than his chronological age uh so from my experience that's good that it isn't older than his actual age but uh as i'm going to show in a minute uh he can do better and uh so i'm not here to bash any uh dietary ideology my view is that we should be eating exercising and supplementing with the goal of optimizing our internal health including our biomarkers so uh this is just one blood test and of his so uh how is his data a few months later like what's the average you know uh you'll never see in a scientific study only one data point published for one subject so you know we would need more data to figure out what's his you know natural variation year to year is this an accurate and accurate reflection of what his biological age is uh for every every test or is this you know the worst of his uh blood test data also it's again it's an n of one so the uh with the goal of quantifying biological age on a carnivore diet there are currently no published studies so i wanted to compare paul's data against a bigger cohort you know to see how how it compares but there are no studies for the carnivore diet and looking at biological age uh as of yet so with that in mind if anyone is carnivore vegan vegetarian whatever your dietary approach is send me your data if you've got data for each of these blood tests and we can evaluate which is which seems to be the best approach for optimizing biological age i'm going to argue my approach is best because i let the biomarkers dictate what my diet and even what my exercise training approach should be so what's my data so i've measured four times in 2020 and for those who have seen those previous videos this will be a review in my apologies for those of you who are new welcome so uh my first blood test measurement that included the nine biological age uh variables uh was in february of 2020 uh thereby resulting in a phenotypic age otherwise known as biological age of 34.5 years uh notice that my chronological age is 47. I turned 47 in january so uh based on this data i'm 12 and a half years younger than my chronological age so then i retested in march uh again uh my biological age was uh 33.3 so still doing pretty great and then worst readings uh probably uh because of my seasonal allergies or one reason seasonal allergies that i get in the summer uh so now i've got a phenotypic age otherwise known as biological age uh 35.7 and then again my my measurement in july of 39 my worst measurement ever but nonetheless when i take the average of these four values in 2020 i'm a little bit more than 11 years younger than my chronological age so if you remember paul's data it was 3.4 years younger than his chronological age so i'd argue that paul could do better and including other stuff into his diet may be a wise approach or at least doing the experiment to see how it affects his biological age so i didn't really introduce the biological age calculator that i'm using so let's take a step back with the goal of optimizing biologically let's take a step back and go through what it is and how can we optimize it or what what's inherent in the test so that we can potentially uh optimize it so the uh as i mentioned on the first slide the biological age calculator known as uh levine's phenotypic age uh comprises uh albumin creatinine glucose c-reactive protein percentage lymphocytes uh the average red blood cell volume the average or the red red blood cell distribution with alkaline phosphatase white blood cell count and age so the combination of these nine uh biomarkers uh and age was shown to predict chronological age uh almost perfectly linearly so uh the correlation for for uh the biological age calculator was 0.94 note that a a correlation of 1.0 is perfectly linear so a score a correlation of 0.94 is a very strong correlation now this data was derived from nhanes 3 so the third national health and nutrition examination survey so then they replicated this study in another cohort so nhanes four and they found an even stronger correlation or very similar strong correlation of 0.96 as you can see in this picture uh uh phenotypic age otherwise known as biological age almost perfectly linear linearly correlates with chronological age so in other words these nine uh biomarkers that are commonly found on a blood test when you go to your doc your doctor every year and age are very strongly correlated with chronological age so what's the significance of this biological age calculator with disease risk so having an older biological age is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so we can see that here i've uh put an arrow uh and so for every one year increase in biological age all-cause mortality risk increases by nine percent now those findings uh were similar regardless of age so if you were a young adult middle-aged adult or an older adult uh your if you had an older biological age your all-cause mortality risk increased uh for example here by 13 10 and 8 percent in young middle-aged and older adults respectively so what about disease-specific mortality uh so i've uh indicated where the having an older biological age was associated with a higher mortality risk for each of these diseases so heart disease cancer chronic respiratory disease diabetes influenza or pneumonia and kidney related issues nephritis or nephrosis so for each of those outcomes having an older biological age was associated with an increased outcome specific mortality now note that having an older biological age was associated with uh significantly associated with an increased risk for mortality from chronic lower respiratory disease and influenza or pneumonia so for me the obvious thought is well what about coronavirus covet 19 related mortality so in a pre-print that was uh recently published we can we can see that an older biological age as assessed by this biological age calculator levine's phenotypic age was associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality acm in uh covet 19 patients uh so that's recent but that's a pre-print so you know they've got to go through the peer review process um before it's officially published all right so within so now that i've shown you the biological age calculate calculator phenotypic gauge within the reference range what's optimal for each of these nine biological age biomarkers and once we know what's optimal we can then work on optimizing the ones that should be improved and you know stay the course for the ones that are are in good shape so i'm going to analyze paul's data to see where where his uh biological age data is good and where it can be improved so first going right through this list one by one albumin higher is better and how do we know that so i'm going to show you representative data for very large studies the larger the stutter the strong potentially the stronger the data if you've got a very small study you know the the results may not be generalizable to larger population population whereas if you've got large population data the data may be reflective of obviously the the larger you know population so in this study of more than a million subjects we're looking at levels of serum albumin on the y-axis plotted against age and what we can see is that abdomen levels peak in youth for both men and women and then decline through aging now the reference range is 35 to 50 grams per liter otherwise 3.5 to 5 milligrams per deciliter but that doesn't tell you should it be high or low i mean clearly the aging data suggests that it's high now paul's data was 4.1 grams per liter and based on that data through extrapolation on this aging curve he's got the abdomen levels of a 75 year old which isn't good so now aging data is interesting but what about the association with all-cause mortality so that's we're looking at here in data from 1.7 million subjects the female mortality ratios on the y-axis on the bottom and the male mortality ratios on the y-axis on the top and i've highlighted and read that lowest risk for all-cause mortality in men and women is 4.5 and 4.4 respectively so you want your album levels to be at least those levels if you're a man or a woman to have the lowest risk of all-cause mortality now note this data also is independent of age so regardless if you were younger than 50 50 to 69 or older than seven years uh all-cause mortality risk increased in both genders with lower levels of albion so albumin higher levels are better uh i'd argue as close to 5 which is found in youth would be ideal so creatinine not too low but not too high so um first so so let's take a look and see if if paul 0.98 milligrams per deciliter is optimal or not so uh there weren't any pretty pictures but creatinine has been shown to increase uh from 1.05 milligrams per deciliter and 39 uh 30 to 59 year olds to 1.14 in 60 to 75 year olds um and then what about all-cause mortality risk i should say too that creatinine is well known to increase during aging because uh the egfr the estimated uh glomerular filtration rate which is a measure of kidney function uses creatinine uh to derive the egfr formula and egfr is well known to decline with age so for it to decline with age uh creatinine has to go up uh so all right all cause mortality risk so that's we're looking at here with the mortality odds ratio on the y-axis and creatinine in milligrams per deciliter on the x-axis so the reference range is 0.76 to 1.27 milligrams per deciliter but that doesn't suggest what's optimal so in this study of more than 30 000 subs subjects we can see that the lowest risk for all-cause mortality was around 0.8 milligrams per deciliter with risk significantly increasing at levels below that and risks significantly increasing for uh creatinine levels that are higher than that so uh creatinine levels can also besides being a marker of kidney function creatinine levels can also be an indicator of muscle mass because it's one of the storage locations for creatinine in the body so generally if someone has more muscle mass they'll also have higher levels of creatinine so even though uh you know 0.8 has been shown to be lowest risk for all-cause mortality i'd argue that paul's 0.98 isn't too far from optimal because he carries more muscle mass than the average person all right glucose this is an easy one and probably everybody knows this data already so uh 80 to 94 milligrams per decimal per deciliter is optimal and paul's right in that range 87. So where am i getting those numbers from so first this is data in more than 12 million subjects looking at glucose levels on the fasting glucose levels on the y axis plotted against age and what we can see is for both men and women glucose levels are in the mid 80s in the youth around 20 years old and then they both increase uh during aging to levels of 100 or greater uh for both genders what about all-cause mortality risk so here we can see that 80 to 94 is associated with the lowest point of this j-curve with values lower than 80 being associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk and values a greater than 95 also associated with uh an increase all-cause mortality risk so again paul's 87 his glucose levels glucose levels are looking good as of now all right c reactive protein so uh first paul's data was 1.7 milligrams per liter which based on the reference range which can go as high as three milligrams per liter would be considered fine um and i know paul posted on his uh web page for the for the rogan show notes another blood test measurement of 0.8 showing that his crp was elevated because he did a hard workout the day before and he posted a lower crp but when i looked at the test date his test date for the day that i'm showing you was in uh july and then his pre his subsequent test date for his lower crp was in september so and he didn't post corresponding uh you know all these other corresponding biomarker data with crp so i can't just plug in 0.8 into this data because all of these data occurred on the same day it you know it's impossible to speculate what his other data would have been on the 0.8 crp so hopefully paul will post all of his data and more of it so we can get a better picture of what his biological age uh data is is it 39 or is it something else all right so in looking at that 1.7 milligrams per liter crp does it you know is that is that good or bad and so let's have a look at the aging data and the all-cause mortality data so first uh we're looking at what we're looking at here in this study is that crp levels increase during age aging from uh starting from the 20 to 39 year olds through 40 to 49 50 to 64 and so on we can see that crp levels are lowest in the young youngest age group now uh these data are not in absolute uh values so not in grams per liter these are log transform data i don't for whatever reason the the authors log transform their data probably to uh to perform statistical analyses so these aren't absolute numbers um nonetheless what we can see is that for women um crp levels triple such that uh an 85 year old has threefold higher levels of crp than a 20 to 39 year old and similarly for men uh crp levels go up by 5.4 fold for an 85 year old versus a young adult 20 to 39 years old so for for that lower would suggest to be better so what about all-cause mortality risk so a lower crp has been associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk in many studies so let's have a look so first less than three milligrams per liter that's one study so based on that if that's the only study that i showed you you would say paul's data is great all right but then we've got three studies showing less than one milligram per liter is uh optimal and so now we're in a limbo game how low can you go so two studies showed less than 0.86 and 0.83 were associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk but then two and two additional studies show 0.5 to 0.8 for crp and then lastly four studies have shown that having crp levels less than 0.33 milligrams per liter was associated with a maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk so based on this data i'd argue that the 1.7 is far from optimal and getting as close to zero may be optimal all right so lymphocyte percentage uh and there isn't any data i i couldn't find any published data for lymphocyte percentage uh with all-cause mortality risk but there is data for how it changes during aging um all right so let's have a look at that so first paul's data was 26.8 percent uh so of the total white blood cell uh count lymphocytes are 26.8 percent of that so in the in the data we're looking at the percentage of lymphocytes plotted against chronological age and the sample size in this sub in this study was about 378 000 subjects notice that the reference range for the percentage of lymphocytes has not been established yet but usually on a blood test the absolute numbers of lymphocytes are are reported in addition to the um percentage but it's just that the reference range for the percentage hasn't been isn't like an official thing all right so what we can see in youth is that for both men and women so women in the blue and men uh in the green uh they start off in youth with values between 27 to around 28 29 of the of their total white blood cell count so uh based on that data we could argue that uh paul's level of 26.8 is pretty close to optimal i mean it's not too far from the 28 or so uh so you know it that that's pretty close however note that uh for men uh lymphocytes consistently decline during decline during aging such that someone in uh you know in their 20s with a 28 lymphocyte percentage uh compared with someone in their 90s having a lymphocyte lymphocyte percentage of 18 yeah and then a weird curve for women so lymphocyte percentage declines till about 35 increases uh until 55 60 and then declines again uh nonetheless if you compared a young woman's data with uh an 80 to 90 year old the 80 to 90 year old based on this uh data would have less a lower lymph cypher percentage compared with the uh younger woman all right mcv so the mean corpuscular volume and this is essentially a measure of uh what's the fluid how big uh is the red blood cell are they big and have a high volume or are they small and have a smaller volume so uh there aren't many studies that have looked at mcv in terms of how it changes during aging but nonetheless this data is representative so um i'm going to show you here uh data for um this data this this um study included both longitudinal and cross-sectional data so a smaller number and that's in the you know top here so for example looking at young sample number 25 uh the data for mcv under mean that's the longitudinal data for those subjects and then the data in parentheses is the cross-sectional data so you've got three different groups and then one group that was sampled over many years so what we can see that for both so first i should say that paul's data was 83.7 so let's see how it fits into the aging data and all-cause mortality so uh so i've boxed both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal data together longitudinal data on top cross-sectional data on the bottom and what we can see is that there's a significant increase in mcv levels from young middle to middle aged and old going from about 89 to 91 percent to 92 93 so um having lower mcv would be uh what you would be expected to find in young adults so uh how does how does that all cause mortality risk look in terms of mcv and that's what we we see here in the study of 36 000 subjects so what we can see is that compared to the reference so having lower levels of mcv in this case 90.5 to 93 percent uh having higher mcv low levels greater than 95.8 at least in men or actually both in men and women is associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk related to uh mc having a higher mcv similar data is found in women albeit with somewhat different numbers so 89.2 to 91.6 as the reference for lowest risk and then greater than 94 for mcv would be associated with higher all cost mortality risk so pause data would fall into the first quartile which is not significantly different from the second quartile looking at this data so uh one could argue that his mcv data is uh is optimal all right red blood cell distribution width so uh most aren't familiar with this biomarker so i'm just going to introduce it a little bit all right so his value of 13.4 let's see how that fits into the aging and all-cause mortality story so first what is the rdw so basically it's a measure of the variability and size of your red blood cells so if you have red blood cells that are all approximately the same size your rdw the you know the variability and size will be relatively small so you'll have a relatively smaller rdw in contrast when you have uh some variability in the distribution inside so you have some large red blood cells and some uh intermediate and and small red blood cells there's more variability in size there so your rdw will be higher so rdw increases during aging and that's we can see here with rdw percent on the y axis plotted against age and we can see the trend line clearly going up from values somewhere around 12 and a half to 14 or greater in older adults what about all cause mortality risk let's see how that 13.4 fits in so first i'm looking at a study of about 30 000 subjects and we're looking at the survival plotted on the y-axis so lowest all-cause mortality risk was found for rdws of 9.7 to 12 that's the black line and then paul's data would fall into the orange line right here and those data are significantly different so people who had a lower rdw 9.7 to 12 had an improved survival compared with where paul's data is so let's look at a bigger study so in this case 240 000 plus subjects and what we can see here is that having an rdw less than 12.5 uh was with uh was considered was found to be the lowest risk and then values that paul had 13.4 had a 19 would uh have in this study at least have a 19 higher risk of all-cause mortality so can we go higher than 240 000 subjects in the study so in this study in this study 3.2 million approximately and we can see what we can see is that when compared with lowest risk so that would be the group that had a rdw of 8.1 to 12.5 percent having uh an rdw of greater than 13.1 as i've shown by the hour was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so based on this data paul's rdw is not optimal uh and there needs to you know he needs to do some stuff to improve all right alkaline phosphatase so uh paul's data was around 89 and i've put in in the title slide that values around 50 are associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk so before we get to that what about the aging data so it increases during aging but there weren't any pretty pictures so let's have a look at the all-cause mortality data so this is data in 8.9 million subjects and we're looking at a relative risk for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the concentration of alkaline phosphatase on the x so the place where the 95 confident confidence interval and that's shown by the dashed lines uh with the the strong line that the undashed line in the middle the place where um all of that crosses one uh that's where risk significantly starts to increase or decrease in this case increases so for values higher than around 50 we can see that the 95 confidence interval completely passes one so values higher than 50 would be associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk um so where's paul's data so we can see based on his 89 that he'd be at approximately two-fold higher all-cause mortality risk based on his alkaline phosphatase data so there's some room for improvement there too all right white blood cells um paul's data is 5.1 otherwise known as 5100 cells per microliter let's see how that fits uh in terms of the aging and it all cause mortality data so first i'm going to show you data from the baltimore longitudinal longitudinal study on aging that's where the same subjects gave blood test data repeatedly many times uh in in most cases up to 30 years so they're they're followed you know for up to 30 years so what we can see is that in the about 22 years before their death white blood cells start to increase all the way until the end of death so what about um life expectancy so most of the subjects in this study came in uh at approximately middle age so 40ish to 50s and this is life expectancy from the baseline visit baseline white blood cell count at the baseline visit uh what was their life expectancy based on that so um and it's important to note that the reference range for white blood cells is 3.4 to 10.8 um thousand cells per microliter so that doesn't tell you much it's a giant range so first we can see that the life expectancy for the white blood cell group uh that had thirty five hundred to six thousand had the longest life expectancy uh in comparison having six thousand to ten thousand had a shorter life expectancy by about eight years uh even worse having higher than ten thousand so that would be you know the high end of the white blood cell reference range lived about ten years shorter than the thirty five hundred to six thousand and worst of all uh the group that had uh less than 3 500 white blood cells lived the shortest so having white blood cells in 3 500 to 6 000 cells per microliter range is uh looks like it would be optimal all right so as a summary of paul saladino md's biomarkers on the carnivore diet so biomarkers that are within the optimal range glucose i put creatinine in there probably because of muscle mass and it's not too far from the 0.8 mcv percentage of lymphocytes and white blood cells but there are also biomarkers that can be improved admin crp rdw alkaline phosphatase and by playing with his diet so that maybe it's a little bit less meat heavy and adding some other stuff i'd argue he could uh find the diet that's best for him not necessarily sticking to the absolutism of it needs to be the carnivore diet all right that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
