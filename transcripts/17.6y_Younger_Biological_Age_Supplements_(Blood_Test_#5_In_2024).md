# 17.6y Younger Biological Age: Supplements (Blood Test #5 In 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number five in 2024 when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag we saw that my biological age was 17.6 years younger than my chronological so what might be contributing to these data so let's start off with prescription meds and if you're familiar with the channel this won't be a surprise i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin 137 and a half micrograms per day every day since then all right so what about supplements so one supplement that that's a general staple in the approach for 8 to n months out of the year the non-summer months is vitamin d albeit a relatively low amount of 1,000 ius per day and i supplemented with that for 23 of the 59 days that correspond to this blood test so what does that mean where am i getting this this 59-day period well it starts immediately after blood test number four which was on may 28th and it last through the day before blood test number five which was on june 25th so that's a 59-day period all right so then a question that we can ask is is infrequent vitamin d supplementation as i only took it for less than half of the those days less than half of the 59-day period plus sun exposure and there too was somewhat infrequent i've only been able to get 4 days of full body sun sun exposure and only up to about 30 minutes each session so is that combination sufficient to optimize circulating levels of vitamin d so to find out i blood tested more specifically for circulating levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d which is the metric of vitamin d status or systemic circulating uh vitamin d status and to do that i used ala labs so for those who don't know i don't go to my physician and basically beg them to run tests every two months or so i've been using ulta ulta labs where i order exactly what i want i print out that form i bring it to quest if you live in the states you can do that too and then i got the results within 24 hours so it's a pretty great deal if you ask me so if you want to do that too and you're a regular blood test user you can help support the channel when you blood test so for the on for blood test number five in 2024 while measuring all the other stuff on the same day as those results circulating levels of vitamin d were 38 nanog per per milliliter which then raises the question what's optimal so to address that we'll take a look at a meta analysis of 32 studies as shown here on the y- axis is the hazard ratio this is all cause mortality risk or risk of death for all causes plotted against serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d so circulating levels of vitamin d in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and in this case when the vertical lines are completely above and below the black diamonds we have a significant association and we can see that that's true when vitamin d is 20 to 29 nanog per mil and actually anything lower than 20 nogan per mil is also uh significantly associated with an all cause increased all cause mortality risk so just to rephrase that vitamin d levels circulating levels of vitamin d 25 hydroxy vitamin d less than 30 ns per mil is associated with a significantly reduced risk of death for all causes what about greater than 30 nanog per mil well as you can see by the 95% confidence interval at all values greater than 30 nog per mill that overlaps with the hazard ratio of one which shows that it uh vitamin d levels circulating vitamin d levels greater than 30 is not significantly associated with all cause mortality risk when it's greater than 30 so in terms of what's anything greater than 30 n per mil which gives me a check mark at 38 now there is a more specific way to ask the question for what's optimal for vitamin d and that would be is if i was measuring 25 hydroxy d on the same day as all of the other blood tests uh for every test and then i could look at correlations for circulating levels of vitamin d versus all of the other biomarkers for example is is vitamin d circulating levels of vitamin d are they significantly correlated with glucose creatinine hsc rp etc and because we know how those biomarket change during aging and what's optimal in terms of all cause mortality risk i can get it a more specific circulating vitamin d level that may be optimal so it may not be 38 or 30 ns per mill it could be 60 it could be 45 i haven't collected that data yet i don't think the roi on doing that experiment is greater than just being higher than 30 nanograms per mil if others want to do that experiment i'd say go for it but i don't see a a further you know return on investment for measuring circulating levels of vitamin d at every every test all right what about other supplements so i also supplemented with nicotinic acid 50 to 60 migr per day and i should mention that i bought a bulk uh powder for nicotinic acid and then i dissolved it in water so i make my own stock solution and then drink a very small amount to get 50 to 60 milligrams per day so it's not pills or capsules which has other fillers in them hoping to avoid so i took nicotinic acid for 30 of the 59-day periods potentially to potentially increase ned and just like the vitamin d story we don't have to hope that we can you know increase circulating levels of whatever metabolite that we're interested in we can measure it so to measure it i sent blood to g infinity for ned analysis discount link in the video's description if you want to do that yourself and on the july 26 the same day as blood test number five uh nad levels blood intracellular nad levels was 27.8 micromolar not too far away from my average of around 30 micromolar so not too bad my lowest has been less than 20 micromolar so that's actually a a nice jump uh with just 50 to 60 mig of nicotinic acid per day i also supplemented with 5 gam per day of branch chain amino acids but you can see that's only for one day out of the 59-day period and that was because i did the experiment for test number four to see if branch chain amino acids 5 gr per day could impact homocysteine through the gut and there's a paper in a parkinson's animal model that suggested that could be true so i decided to test it homosysteine was not reduced uh in response to 5 g per day an additional 5 g per day in addition to dietary intake so i removed that from the approach once i got those results so once i got the results after supplementing for one day in after blood test number five i took it out when i saw that it didn't work all right so notice that's it in terms of supplements no other geo protectors or senolytics and that's for now and if you follow me on patreon that's not going to be the story you already know that's not going to be the story for blood test number six as i have included a gero protector for a very specific reason so we'll see that story uh probably sometime after blood test number six in 2024 which is scheduled for september all right so what about diet and in the interest of time we'll cover that story in the next video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and affiliates that you can help support the channel if you blood test and use the links on your own including ulta labs epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you want to wear the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
