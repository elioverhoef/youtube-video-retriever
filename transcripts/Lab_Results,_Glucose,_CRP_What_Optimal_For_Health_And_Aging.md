So moving forward glucose glucose increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased mortality risk so first starting with how it changes during age large study again 12.5 million subjects we can see that so glucose levels on the y-axis an age on the x and women in red men in blue we see that men increase their glucose level is increased to till about 60 where they somewhat plateau with a further you know additional increase towards later life in the eighties whereas for women that increase is more linear from around 28 or so all the way up to the oldest age here so we can see that on you know that lowers is is better especially when considering that it increases during aging so somewhere around 85 86 is this found biological you now that that number is important because we look at risk of death for all causes and that's what's shown here that has a ratio first is the circulating concentration of glucose levels so the lowest point of the curve is where lowest risk for all cause mortality would be and that for that it's for eighty to ninety four milligrams per deciliter so notice that below eighty eighty milligrams per deciliter all cause mortality risk is significantly increased and also anything higher than ninety four is significantly increased so based on this large data set it we could suggest that 1894 would be optimal so resisting the age-related increase in glucose so again in looking at my once a year measurements from 2005 to 2015 my average local vez level is 89 and then as i've gotten more serious and tracked more often and tracked my diet i it's eighty seven point seven so comparing these two groups of data they are not different so i basically resisted the age-related change in coulis levels at least for now so how is my diet correlated with blood glucose so this is actually a strong correlation between blood glucose levels and my fat intake total grams of fat per day on the x-axis and the this correlation is 0.75 so it's pretty strong so what it's basically saying or suggesting is that as i eat more fat my coulis levels go up which is going in the wrong direction and fat is not all just one thing fats comprised of monounsaturated fats polyunsaturated fats and saturated fats so they may not all equally affect or be correlated with my glucose levels so within my fat intake the correlation between saturated fat with glucose is moderately strong so that may be driving this association saturated fat so this the easy answer would be maybe to keep my blood glucose low just eat less saturated fat but as we see in a couple slides that may not be that simple so only forward c-reactive protein also increases with aging and higher levels are associated with a higher all cause mortality risk so the reference range is 0 to 3 milligrams per liter but that doesn't really tell us which way you know the or how much crf you should be in terms of optimal for aging and risk of death for all causes so granted not many studies giant studies i mean millions of subjects have looked at crp in terms of aging the largest that i could find had 13 hundred or so subjects which is still pretty big compared to other studies but nonetheless these aren't absolute numbers too because even though it says it's in grams later the data were back transform long transform the back transform but the magnitude of the changes is what what's important here so looking at crp levels for men and women during aging so looking at you know the various age groups all the way up to 85 or older we can see that for men crp increases more than fivefold and for women it increases more than three-fold now again as i mentioned the reference ranges from 0 to 3 milligrams for depth per liter but that doesn't tell us what's optimal is is a crp of 2 just as just as good as a crp of 1 or less so let's have a look at some of that data so less than three lower crp lower than three is associated with the lower all cause mortality can we get lower so in three studies less than one milligram per liter was associated with reduced all cause mortality or estaci√≥n risk how about lower than that well in these two studies point eight six and point eight three milligrams per liter in these two studies we can go even further another two studies found 0.5 2.8 may be optimal but it didn't doesn't stop there for studies found that crp levels less than 0.33 milligrams per liter were associated with lowest risk of death from all costs so from this we can conclude or you know the data suggests that i lower is better for crp and as close to zero as you can get may be optimal so looking at my diet with crp and i have less data for crp because i just started tracking it last year so i think i have eight eight data points two four six eight data points and the strongest correlation is with my average daily fat intake so in this case higher fat intake total fat intake is correlated with a lower crp on the y-axis and even going forward within my fat intake the the correlation between saturated fat actually should be a negative correlation so it so higher saturated fat intake strongly correlated with a lower crp in my data so that would suggest if i eat more saturated fat and i get most of my saturated fat from coconut butter and kick cocoa beans and make homemade chocolate with cocoa beads so that may be a good way to lower cip at least based on this data but not so fast because if you remember a couple slides ago higher fat intake and a higher saturated fat intake were associated with higher glucose levels which would be going in wrong direction so these data in straight that you know that it's a constant trial and error process you know anyone who uh you know professes to say off of one blood test hey this is what you should eat i think that's you know spurious it's a constant trial and error process and i've as i mentioned at twenty up to 25 blood tests and i'm still you know constantly tweaking my diet to find out what's optimal across the board not just for warner or two biomarkers so finding a sweet spot for that is is key
