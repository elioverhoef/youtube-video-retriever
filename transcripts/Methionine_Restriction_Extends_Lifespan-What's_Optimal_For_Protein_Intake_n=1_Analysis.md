Methionine restriction extends lifespan so first looking at data in male mice controls were fed a diet that contained 0.43 methionine and methionine restricted mice were fed a diet that contained 65 percent less dietary methionine or 0.15 percent so methionine restriction was started at 12 months of age in this study and when looking at median survival so this is the time when half of the population has died half is still alive and that median lifespan for the controls was 948 days we can see an increase in median survival for the methionine restricted mice of about seven percent now it wasn't just median survival that was improved it was also maximal survival which was defined as the age at when ten percent of the calorie remained and we can see that for contr for the controls was only about two mice left at about 11 uh 1175 days but in contrast many more mice were still alive on the methionine restricted diet somewhere in the seven to eight uh mice range so significantly increased maximal survival and median survival for male mice on a methionine restricted diet now one study is nice other studies can confirm or deny this uh this is a true effect or not so here we're looking at data in rats and in this study rats were fed a diet that contained 0.86 percent methionine or a diet that was methionine restricted 80 reduced in this case 0.17 methionine and and this in this study in contrast with the data for the mouse study this was started even younger so when the rats were only 42 days old so when looking at median survival the controls lived 818 days so 50 survival but then we can see a significantly increased median survival for the methionine restricted rats in this case a 29 increase and also maximal survival was increased by 12 percent in the methionine restricted mouse or sorry rat group so from this we can see that methionine restriction extends lifespan now note that methionine is an amino acid and amino acids are found in protein so if we reduce dietary protein intake we should expect to reduce overall methionine intake so with that in mind the focus of this video is going to be how much dietary protein is optimal for health and potentially longevity and to address that let's have a look at my own data using an n equals one uh analysis so to address the question how much dietary protein is optimal for health and potentially longevity uh to i know my my dietary protein intake from april uh 2015 through april of 2022 so for the past seven years and that's because over that seven day span a seven year span i've weighed literally all of my food using a food scale as shown there that's actually the exact brand that i use all right and then food amounts are entered into chronometer uh which is an online nutrition tracking app now i'm not currently sponsored by them so there are many other apps that can do this and i'm not here to say that chronometer is the best so if there are other apps that you use um that they may be just as good as chronometer all right so then chronometer provides daily protein intake and then i log that into an excel spreadsheet so let's have a look at my daily protein intake over the past seven years and that's what we can see here from again april 2015 through april of 2022. Now note that each purple dot is the average daily protein intake that corresponds to a blood test so in between blood test number one and number two in 2022 there was a 49 day period so the purple dot would be the 49 day average for protein intake and that corresponds to test number two similarly using that approach there was a 42 day period in between test number six in 2021 and test number one in 2022 so the purple dot for that would be a 42 day average for protein intake so over this seven year span i've had protein intakes and average daily protein intake as low as 78 grams per day as shown there but also as high as 148 grams per day now my average over that seven-year span is about 114 grams per day now note that since 2019 early 2019 so about the last three years we can see that i've been reducing my protein intake uh over all these blood tests so a three year period small reductions but uh you know consistent over the last last three years uh such that for my last test again for test number two in 2022 i averaged 103 grams per day which is below my average overall average over that span so the question is why why have i been reducing overall protein intake so i have up to 36 blood tests for blood biomarkers over this same seven year span and that that can help us address the question how much dietary protein is optimal for health and potentially longevity by looking at the correlation for protein intake with big picture biomarkers over this seven year period so in term in terms of the addressing the question what's the correlation for dietary protein intake with big picture biomarkers i covered the big picture biomarkers in my last video so i'll leave a link in the right corner for more details about that approach so here are the big picture biomarkers and their correlation with dietary protein intake so what's statistically significant so actually let's first we should uh delineate some caveats so if protein intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right then i would reduce overall protein intake for the next test relative to my average now if protein intake is significantly correlated with an equal number of biomarkers going in the right and wrong direction i would then aim for my average protein intake 114 grams per day over the past seven years and then in the third situation if protein intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong then i would increase overall protein intake above my average intake all right so now we can address what is dietary protein intake or is it significantly correlated with the any of these big picture biomarkers so starting from the top we can see that a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose and just putting that into context glucose increases during aging is shown here for both men and women but only focusing on the data for men as that directly applies to me we can see that it increases during aging so that that protein intake for me is significantly correlated with higher glucose that correlation is going in the wrong direction and hence i gave it a red arrow so going down the list we can see that a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine homocysteine increases during aging as shown here from the 40 year olds up to 67 year olds of this study and again looking at data from men we can see that homocysteine increases during aging so when considering that a protein intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine which would be found in youth that's why i've given it a green arrow all right so moving along a relatively high protein intake is also significantly correlated with higher blood urea nitrogen bond as shown there and if you saw my last video you know that bun increases during aging as shown here so uh in youth bond is relatively low and then it increases as you can see by that red line so when considering that a higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher bond that's going in the wrong direction red arrow all right so next up we can see that a higher protein relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher ldl ldl increases during aging as shown here so relatively uh youthful values uh our youthful values for ldl are low but ldl increases during aging as you can see by the red arrows but note that relatively low ldl can be found in youth and also in an advanced age so for example looking at a value of 110 which is the average value for someone that's 32 years old in this study 110 can also be found as the average value for someone that's 88. So is relatively low ldl indicative of youth or aging so to address that let's use a different analysis now it's biomarkers versus biomarkers in this case ldl versus these other big picture biomarkers so what's the correlation for ldl with the big picture biomarkers and that's what we can see here so i'm just going to run through this really quickly as this is a side story to the overall uh story of dietary protein intake and the big picture biomarkers so a relatively higher ldl in my case this may not be true for others is significantly correlated with higher glucose higher creatinine higher bond higher neutrophils a lower percentage of lymphocytes and the red arrows indicate that each of these correlations are significant correlations are going in the wrong direction higher red blood cells and i've given that a green hour for now because red blood cells decline during aging so a positive correlation would potentially uh improve the age-related decline or resist the age-related decline for red blood cells but we'll see as we'll see in a minute uh that may not be a green arrow maybe a red so to summarize the correlations for ldl with a big picture biomarkers ldl is significantly correlated with five going in the wrong direction and only one in the right direction which gives it a net score of minus four so in my case lower ldl may be optimal which kind of agrees with the aging data so when returning to our big picture analysis for protein intake we can now give ldl a red arrow as relatively lower in my data again may be optimal and again only for me i don't know if this would be true for others so moving along we can see that a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher neutrophils and we know that neutrophils increase during aging as shown there data for men in green and we can see that age-related increase so that higher neutrophils are significant correlated with higher protein is going in the wrong direction red arrow so a relatively higher protein intake is also significantly correlated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes and we know if you saw my last video again that lymphocyte percentage declines during aging as shown there and more specifically the data for men delineated by the red lines you can see the age-related decline so that a higher protein intake is significantly correlated with lower percentage of lymphocytes that's going in the wrong direction as lower levels are found in the aged and not in youth so red arrow all right so we can also see that a higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher platelets and i've given that a green arrow and that's because platelets decline during aging so starting in youth 20 to 30 year olds we can see that platelet levels and these are data in men are around 231 and then during aging up to 100 years old we can see that platelet levels decline to less than 210. So note that my platelets are almost always in the 200 to 300 range and without getting into too much uh data platelets less than 200 and greater than 300 have been shown to be associated with increased all-cause mortality rates so a u-shaped curve so within the 200-300 range is higher necessarily better so again we can address that using this biomarker versus biomarker analysis in this case platelets versus the other big picture biomarkers so what's the correlation for platelets with these other big picture biomarkers so running through the data relatively higher platelets are significantly correlated with higher blood urinary nitrogen higher vldl a lower percentage of lymphocytes higher red blood cells which superficially would be a green hour for now an older biological age as measured by aging.ai which would obviously be going in the wrong direction we don't want to have older biological ages so to summarize relatively higher platelets are significantly correlated with four biomarkers going in the wrong direction and only one in the right which gives the biomarker versus biomarker analysis for platelets a net score of minus three going in the wrong direction so platelets towards the low end of my range in this case closer to 200 may be optimal so when considering the positive correlation for dietary protein intake with platelets that would then give it a red arrow as higher may not necessarily be better in my case all right so moving right along a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher red blood cells as shown there and we know that red blood cells decline during aging as you can see they're relatively high in youth and then they decline such that older adults have values less than four compared to young adults who have values closer to 4.8 so but this although i've given it a green arrow note that relatively higher red blood cells in my data are significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and that's when using this biomarker versus biomarker analysis so just running through that data real quick we can see that relatively higher red blood cells are significantly correlated with higher glucose higher the higher creatinine so potentially worse kidney function higher blood urea nitrogen lower ast the liver enzyme and that's good news because in my case ast has a tendency to or had a tendency to go higher than even the reference range so that inverse correlation is potentially good news for lower ast higher ldl which we just saw lower for me maybe better higher neutrophils a lower lymphocyte percentage and higher platelets so having relatively higher red blood cells in my data may not be good when when looking at the net effect on the big picture biomarkers we can see that relatively higher red blood cells are significantly correlated with seven going in the wrong direction and only two including mcv uh in the right direction i should mention that mcv levels increase during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so that we have an inverse or a negative correlation there that's going in the right direction so anyway the net effect for red blood cells would appear to be higher maybe worse in my data especially when considering the net score of -5 so note that even within the reference range my red blood cells have never been higher than the reference range too high may be possible and to summarize relatively lower red blood cells but not too low as they decline during aging may be optimal so in returning to the question of uh what's the correlation for dietary protein intake with the big picture biomarkers we can now give our correlation for red blood cells a red arrow as we know that in a biomarker versus biomarker analysis red blood cells are significantly correlated with more going in the wrong direction than right so to summarize now that we've gone through all the significant correlations for protein intake with the big picture biomarkers we can see that a relatively higher protein intake is significant significant correlated with eight going in the wrong direction and only one in the right for a net score of minus seven now if you remember one of the three caveats in the beginning if protein intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right then i would want to reduce overall protein intake relative to the average and this is one reason why i've been reducing my protein intake over the past three years it's mainly because of this analysis like this with a net score of minus seven for protein intake so when going back to my protein intake uh graph as shown there uh again we can see that 103 grams per day for test number two and for the next test i've actually reduced it a little bit more to 99 grams slow slow and small cuts in order to get to uh you know the truth rather than big cuts is part of my approach for now now when considering that i've been as low as 78 grams per day that raises the question is a daily protein intake somewhere between 78 and 103 grams per day optimal and i don't know i don't yet know the answer there are some issues maybe with muscle mass too that going too low i may limit muscle mass gains and i'm not interested in doing that so there's a balance between muscle mass gains and optimizing the blood biomarkers all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
