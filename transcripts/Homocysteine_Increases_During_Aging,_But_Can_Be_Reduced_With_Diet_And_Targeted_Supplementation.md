Nad levels decline during aging and one strategy for reversing that is supplementation with niacinamide nam nam is converted into nmn which is then converted into nad but potentially we fix one problem but make another worse and that's because homocysteine increases in response to niacinamide supplementation and we can see that here so plasma levels of homocysteine on the y axis are plotted against time after supplementation uh nicotinic acid n a or niacinamide in this case it was 300 milligrams of niacinamide so when compared to controls uh that so people who consumed water people that were supplemented with 300 milligrams of niacinamide one and a half hours after supplementation we can see plasma homocysteine increased from 11 micromolar to 16 and then three hours after supplementation homocysteine went up from 11 to 18 micromolar so why is homocysteine important so first homocysteine increases during aging and that's what we can see here so starting with the data on the left in the study of about 16 000 subjects uh when looking at the data for the men with the white bars and the women for the dark gray or or black bars we can see that homocysteine increases for both men and women now in a relatively small study but that included ages that went beyond the study on the left up to 67 years we can see that over the age of 67 starting with the group that was 65 to 69 years old we can see that homosystem continues to increase from the 65 to 69 year old age range all the way up past 80. So from this we can conclude that homocysteine increases during aging at least from the 40 to 80 year age group so what's the systemic impact for higher levels of homocysteine well homocysteine is associated with or directly impacts the health of many organ systems and that's we can see here so for the cardiovascular system it's been linked with atherosclerosis so fatty streaks in the arteries it's been linked with cardiovascular diseases heart attack and stroke for the kidney it's been associated with kidney dysfunction reduced kidney function with bone fractures and osteoporotic patients with diabetes with reproductive issues including menopause sexual dysfunction and pregnancy uh deficits in sight and hearing and then in the nervous system it's been linked with epilepsy parkinson's alzheimer's and dementia so let's take a look at some of the alzheimer's and dementia related data so that's what we can see here relative risk for alzheimer's related dementia on the y-axis plotted against the blood level of homocysteine on the x-axis and when looking at the uh the la trend line for uh relative risk being one or higher that's where the levels of homosystem would be significantly associated with the incidence of alzheimer's related dementia we can see that blood homocysteine levels in the 14 to 35 micromolar range are associated with an increased risk for the presence of alzheimer's disease-related dementia now also notice that lowest risk for alzheimer's disease-related dementia is uh present for uh values homo homocysteine values that are around five micromolar so it would appear that uh lower is better at least for alzheimer's disease related dementia risk so what about all-cause mortality risk so risk of death for all causes and this is a meta-analysis of six studies that included uh more than eighteen thousand subjects and once again we can see that uh lower may be better and that as the blood levels of homocysteine increase there's a significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality so again as low as possible may be optimal for homocysteine in terms of all-cause mortality risk so what's my data i've been tracking homocysteine since uh 2005 so how am i doing in resisting the age-related increase at the very least so that's what we we're starting to look at here so this is my homosystem data from 2005 to 2021 and i've measured it 18 times over that time period now i started dietary tracking so weighing all my food and then logging all of that data for macro and micronutrients uh in 2015 but before then i i measured more sporadically from 2005 to 2009 and we can see six data points during that time period for homocysteine levels and my average homocysteine during that time was 7.1 micromolar which isn't too bad uh it's pretty close to the five that you know lowest risk for alzheimer's disease related dementia of five micromolar now i mentioned i started dietary tracking in uh 2015 so since then i've measured 12 times and we can see a much wider range including a data point as high as 15 which is definitely going in the wrong direction so my average over the last six years is 10.3 micromolar which is definitely going in the wrong direction so uh and when looking at these two groups of data the before dietary tracking 2005 to 2009 and since i've been dietary tracking 2015 to the present these two groups of data are significantly different so one can conclude that i've definitely succumbed to the age-related increase for homocysteine now there is a silver lining to this data as we can see my last five measurements my homocysteine has been less than 9.1 in five consecutive measurements and my average homocysteine over that period is 8.2 which when compared with the before dietary tracking data is not significantly different so the big question then is how have i recently kept homocysteine relatively low so to assess that we need to take a look at homocysteine metabolism and that's what's shown here so starting with homocysteine right in the center uh if there's a b6 vitamin b6 deficiency homocysteine will accumulate because homocysteine requires a b6 as a cofactor to be converted into cystithione and then uh its b6 is also required to convert cystitis into cysteine and if you take it further you can see that cysteine can then be incorporated into gsh glutathione so if you have a b6 deficiency not only will homocysteine potentially accumulate but you will also have potential decreases in glutathione synthesis so also b12 can contribute to a homocysteine accumulation so uh b12 is required as a required cofactor for homocysteine to be converted back into methionine but it's not just b12 that's involved in that conversion uh dietary folic acid which is converted into blood levels of folate is also required for the reaction that converts homocysteine into methionine and last but not least a betaine deficiency so betaine is also known as trimethylglycine so betaine plus homocysteine is converted into methionine and dimethylglycine so if you're betaine deficient you can also have a potential accumulation for homocysteine now interestingly uh for uh seven weeks in 2020 i tried high-dose betaine trimethylglycine uh so four grams of betaine per day and uh the resulting homocysteine uh in my data was 11.8 micromolar which although it's not my highest level around 15 it's certainly not in that nine range over my last five measurements so i ditched it because it didn't seem to have a major impact on my data however i've been supplementing for the past three years with a daily stack of 400 micrograms per day of methylfolate a thousand micrograms per day of methyl b12 and up to 50 milligrams per day of vitamin b6 so uh when considering i've been tracking my diet for the past six years and logging all that data into an excel file we can see if uh which which or all of these vitamins may be most important for keeping homocysteine low so is homocysteine is homocysteine correlated with my dietary intake of folate b6 and or b12 so first looking at the data for plasma levels of homocysteine on the y-axis against my average daily folate intake and that's also including from supplements uh we can see that although that there's a uh negative correlation meaning higher levels of coral folate are correlated with lower levels of homocysteine that correlation is not statistically significant as indicated by the p-value of 0.13 uh also not significant is the correlation for my average daily b6 intake with plasma levels of homosystem you can see the trend line for that data is approximately flat uh and this and the correlation is not uh it's not a significant correlation as indicated by the p-value of 0.87 so from this we can conclude that homocysteine may not be significantly correlated with my dietary intake of folate or b6 what about b12 and actually we do see a significant correlation here so first starting with uh the data where i wasn't supplementing with vitamin b12 and i have four data points for that on the left my average homocysteine was 12.7 micromolar and then with a vitamin b12 supplementation i have eight uh plasma homocysteine measurements and we can see that my average uh homocysteine level there is 9.1 so about a 30 reduction uh with vitamin b12 now uh when comparing without b12 supplementation four data points with the eight data points for with vitamin b supplementation these two groups of data are significantly different which suggests that vitamin b12 is contributing to the lower levels of homocysteine but b12 may not be the only factor contributing to this reduction and interestingly an even stronger correlation for lower homocysteine is uh with my average daily protein intake that's what we can see here so the correlation coefficient is negative 0.86 and a correlation uh when it's a negative correlation the closer you get to negative one that's as strong as it gets it's perfectly linear so uh that's a better correlation with protein versus homocysteine versus my b12 uh correlation with homocysteine so this suggests higher protein intake lower homocysteine so i actually have we can take a deeper look at that data to investigate how much b12 is contributing and how much my protein intake may be contributing to the lower homocysteine so let's have a look at that so here i've got listed each date that i measured homocysteine and the corresponding average protein intake that corresponded to that homocysteine measurement and then my average b12 intake that corresponds to each homocysteine measurement so first when i wasn't supplementing with b12 my average protein intake based on those four measurements was about 99 grams per day and my average homocysteine level was 12.7 now note that i'm not deficient for b12 here the rda for vitamin b12 is 2.4 micrograms per day so even just for these four data points i'm at least you know around five fold higher than the rda but still my homo system is going in the wrong direction now for the next three data points i was supplementing now with a thousand micrograms per day of vitamin b12 and if you notice the march 19 2018 data it's 936 micrograms per day on average that corresponds to that 10.8 homocysteine measurement so i i wasn't obviously taking my b12 you know this the stack of the three vitamins every day that's why it's a little bit less than a thousand micrograms on average for that for that measurement but nonetheless i have three data points where i've supplemented with vitamin b12 my protein intake although it's five grams higher with an average of 104 grams per day in those three measurements it's not significantly different from the 99 grams per day in the previous four measurements and my average homocysteine over those three measurements is 10.5 micromolar so this is about a 20 reduction that one can infer may be related completely to vitamin b12 now in the last group of data my b12 intake is the same it's a it's a a little bit more than a thousand micrograms per day but my protein intake is higher it's on average 24 grams per day higher than the previous uh periods with an average protein intake average dietary protein intake of 128 grams per day and based on that my homocysteine levels are 8.2 so a further 20 reduction so it looks like b12 on its own without changing protein 20 reduction in homocysteine but then b12 with the combination of higher protein a further additional 20 reduction in homocysteine so the big question is how is higher protein contributing to lower homocysteine and superficially one could say well you've got 24 more grams per day of protein you may be getting more b12 that may be contributing but i'd argue that may not be the case because at best maybe i'll get one to two micrograms of extra b12 assuming that's from animal an increase in animal protein for those extra 24 grams is a thousand and nine micrograms of b12 really different from a thousand and eleven i'm not so sure about that so if anyone's got any ideas how high protein could be contributing to lower homocysteine please leave a comment up below and that's all i've got for now uh thanks for watching if you made it to the end thanks a lot and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
