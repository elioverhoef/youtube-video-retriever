## Transcript

The omega-3 fatty acids epa and dha have a positive impact on many adverse health related conditions and we can see that visually represented here and without going through all of the conditions epa and dha have been shown to reduce inflammation reduce insulin resistance and aspects of aging in this study which was done in rats it increased neurogenesis but epa and dha declined during aging in particular in centenarians epa and dha are lower in centenarians when compared with younger ages and that's what we can see here so starting at the top we've got epa on the left dha on the right and these are relative circulating values these aren't actual concentrations and here we're looking at levels for centenarians or close to centenarians 97 years old and their offspring 67 years old and there we can see that the younger age group had higher levels of epa and dha when compared with the centenarian group in terms of percent reduction centenarians had 23 percent lower levels of epa and a 15 lower levels of dha and all of these values are significant as looking at the p-value and fdr false discovery rate we can see that they're both less than 0.05 now these data in mind could lower epa and dha in centenarians be good for health and the answer to that is probably not so let's take a look at why that's the case so here we're going to take a look at a meta-analysis of 17 studies that included more than 42 000 people for circulating levels of epa and dha versus all-cause mortality risk and first when taking a look at epa we've got the hazard ratio or all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the concentration and here they use percentile ranks with lowest being 10 percentile and highest level of epa at the 90th percentile in terms of what's significant we put up our hazard ratio of one remember where the shaded gray region is completely above or below one we have a significant association and where that's true is for very low levels of epa as shown there with the red star and then as we go higher than the 10th percentile we can see that all cause mortality risk decreases as circulating levels of epa increase but not very high levels of epa as you can see a little bit greater than the 90th percentile level of circulating level for circulating levels of epa that shaded gray region overlaps with one but for most of the epa data relatively low circulating levels were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk whereas relatively higher levels but not at the highest level was associated with a decreased risk all right what about for dha so here when putting up that hazard ratio of one we can see that once circulating levels of dha get to about the 50th percentile higher levels are associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk so for dha intermediate and relatively high circulating levels are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk now in this meta-analysis they also combined epa and dha and looked at all cause mortality risk and we're putting up our hazard ratio of one it's somewhat similar to the epa data where very low levels were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk but now we can see a close to a linear trend in terms of relatively higher levels being potentially better for reducing risk as all values higher than the 10th percentile were associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so from from this study from this meta-analysis we can see that relatively high circulating levels of both of these fatty acids epa and dha are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and this is potentially bad news for this centenarians who had relatively lower levels of epa and dha were compared with their offspring all right so what's my data so to address that i sent blood for at-home metabolomics and if you're familiar with the channel you've probably seen this kit io lowe's kit a lot they include data for 500 metabolites and i've got a few more videos in the queue so there'll probably be a few more uh coming soon but the importance of this kit is that we can see data for communion and tryptophan as components of the day novo nad synthesis pathway i've also made videos on taurine and polyamines which extend lifespan and then also metabolite ratios as an index of oxidative stress so this kit is a gold mine of metabolites and information in terms of health and potentially longevity discount link if you want to use it on your own in the video's description all right so in terms of what's my data we can see that here i now have data for two tests in april and may and i sent blood yesterday for test number three so we'll see how the next batch goes for epa and dha which are shown here in micromolar concentrations we can see that my levels are 2 0.6 and 6.7 micromolar for epa and dha respectively which then raises the question what's optimal now in full full disclosure i think for most metabolomic studies i as iola is a metabolomic kit defining a precise reference range is tricky because most published metabolomic studies are untargeted which means that the one group is just compared against another group and the actual concentrations aren't determined so to define an a range based on a metabolism kit i think is a little bit tricky but what is fair to say is avoiding age-related decline for both epa and dha when considering where my values are now as a baseline i think that's a fair bet especially when considering that relatively low levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and epa and dha are lower in centenarians when compared with offspring so avoiding that age-related decline all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing but also telomere testing true diagnostic provides that or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and their panel is almost exclusively different from ilo's kit including apob die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatron brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
