# Attempting To Further Reduce Biological Age: Reducing Glucose (Without Messing Up Other Biomarkers)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video we saw that my biological age as indicated by morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator was about 13 years younger than my chronological age but there's room for improvement including my glucose levels which were 95 milligrams per deciliter on this test now that's going in the wrong direction as shown here so this is 30 data for 30 blood tests over the past six years and we can clearly see that the trend for glucose for me is increasing during that time span so how do we know that that's going in the wrong direction so for that let's have a look at the public published literature so this is a study of about 12 and a half million subjects and it's we've got fasting glucose plotted on the y-axis against age on the x-axis and for both men in green and women in red when starting in youth with glucose levels of about 85 milligrams per deciliter we can see clearly for both men and women that glucose levels increase during aging and i've arrowed the green to show where i should expect to be based on my chronological age which isn't too far from that 95 that i just had on this blood test now it isn't just that glucose increases during aiding it's also relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so this is that data here with the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the fasting level of serum glucose on the x and we can see that the lowest risk for all-cause mortality is when glucose is 80 to 94 milligrams per deciliter and then above that that value so 95 and higher we see a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk and also less than 80 in increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering that i'm now at 95 for glucose i'm trending towards the the wrong way in terms of all-cause mortality risk as it relates to glucose levels now i've had values within the last six years of about 85 so the goal is to get back to that so the focus of this video is going to involve my attempt to further improve biological age and in part by reducing glucose and it's important to mention that the plan is to not mess up our other biomarkers so let's go through that story so with that in mind uh with the goal of reducing glucose but not making other biomarkers works worse which dietary variables are correlated with higher glucose so of all the macronutrients so fat protein carbohydrate and fiber the macronutrient that is most strongly correlated with my fasting levels of glucose over the past six years in 30 blood tests is my average daily fat intake as shown here so we can see a moderate correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.67 and a highly significant p value and this suggests that a higher daily fat a higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose now fat is not all comprised of the same types of fat fat is comprised of monounsaturated fats mufa polyunsaturated fats including omega-3 o3 and omega-6 o6 and or saturated fat and i left out trans fats the only source of trans fats in my diet comes from cheese and we'll see in a minute that cheese is not involved significantly involved in this story so first the correlation for monounsaturated fat intake the average monounsaturated fat intake mufa with my fasting glucose over the past six years again 30 blood tests and while the trend line looks like it's going up that correlation is not statistically significant similarly uh correlations for my average daily omega-3 intake and my average daily omega-6 intake are not significantly correlated with blood glucose so what about saturated fat intake and its correlation with blood glucose levels so now we see an almost identical plot and a significant correlation so the higher my average daily intake of saturated fat the higher the glucose levels are and again you can see that it's statistically significant and when again when comparing these two plots they're virtually identical one could argue that saturated fat my average daily saturated fat intake may be driving this correlation between total fat intake on fasting glucose now for more specificity saturated fat from which foods and if i know that there are certain foods that can impact this story then it's just a simple measure of taking them out or reducing them now i've tracked my daily food intake since uh july of 28 2018 and it's important to know i've been tracking macro micronutrients since 2015 but it wasn't until 2018 that i decided to actually start tracking food which is a less reductionist approach for tracking overall dietary composition and i have 17 blood tests during that period and we'll see why that's important in just a second so during that period from july 2018 to september first which is the day before my latest blood test on september 2nd a couple weeks ago we can see my average daily saturated fat intake is about 36 grams per day and then the top foods the top five foods where i get about 80 of my daily saturated fat intake comes from coconut butter so it's it's listed as coconut mana that's coconut butter not coconut oil so that's the whole food full fat mozzarella cheese it says stony field yogurt which is full fat plain yogurt sardines cocoa beans which i may use to make my own chocolate and then we see coconut coconut butter again but that's because i was logging it using a different name but it's also coconut butter so uh so of these five foods which is significantly correlated with glucose and that's what's shown here so these are correlations for these five saturated fat containing foods versus glucose over the past three plus year period and including data for 17 blood tests so of these five foods the only one that's significantly correlated with fasting levels of glucose is my intake of full fat yogurt so with that in mind and i started to see this trend late last year i removed the full fat yogurt and replaced it with low fat yogurt and now we can see that the correlation for low fat yogurt is not significantly correlated with glucose and my glucose levels since late 2020 are still greater than 90. So something else is still driving this effect and with that in mind which other dietary factors may be impacting glucose so one of those factors may be b12 vitamin b12 so i've been supplementing with vitamin b12 for a while now and we can see here the plot for my b12 levels uh dietary b12 levels versus fasting glucose and we can see that there's a significantly positive correlation meaning the higher my b12 levels the higher fasting glucose or at least the correlation now the reason i've been taking uh methyl b12 actually not b12 is to limit homocysteine and for me my homocysteine levels have been trending higher and they increase during aging and relatively higher levels of homocysteine are associated with the increased all-cause mortality risk so that's why i've had b12 in my approach and we can see that correlation here for b12 with homocysteine the higher my b12 levels the lower uh that my homocysteine my blood levels of homocysteine or and again this is also a significant correlation so if i remove b12 it may reduce glucose if correlation is causing that in this case for b12 with glucose but it may make homocysteine worse so what's the big picture though for b12 on other biomarkers i don't just want to affect two i want to look at as much of the system as possible to actually see if it will be a net beneficial neutral or detrimental effect so for that i've compiled a composite of biomarkers for multiple organ systems including kidney function liver function lipoproteins immune cells red blood cell related rbc related inflammation and the overall biological age score so these are correlations between my average dietary uh daily dietary b12 intake versus all of these biomarkers over the past six years so 30 blood tests or up to 30 blood tests i've got how many blood tests with the little n next to each biomarker so first we can see that a relatively higher b12 intake aside from the glucose and homocysteine story is associated with three biomarkers going in the right direction so uh higher b12 is correlated with lower ast the liver enzyme aspartate amino transferase which is good news because relatively high levels of ast are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk it's uh b relatively higher levels of b12 are correlated with higher platelets and higher red blood cells which are is also important because both of those decrease during aging now in contrast relatively high levels of b12 dietary b12 in my data are correlated with higher neutrophils which is going in the wrong direction they increase during aging and relatively higher levels of neutrophils are also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk but then a lower lymphocyte percentage and also that uh that biomarker decreases during aging so that's going in the wrong direction so the net effect the net correlative effect of b12 supplementation looks like there are four biomarkers going in the right direction including homocysteine ast platelets and red blood cells and three going in the wrong direction including glucose neutrophils and the percentage of lymphocytes so in sum that seems to be a net plus one so it suggests a small but positive beneficial effect on the net of my all these biomarkers so that suggests that i shouldn't take it out now knowing that this net one plus one score for b12 on these 20 biomarkers what if i make another dietary change to lessen any potential negative effects of b12 removal while still attempting to gain any potential glucose lowering effects of reducing this excess b12 that i was taking in so what would i change now interestingly i see a correlation a significant correlation for my average daily omega-6 fat intake and notice i don't eat seed oils this isn't this is from whole foods i usually get my omega-6 from walnuts pecans and other nuts and or seeds so the higher my omega-6 intake average daily omega-6 intake we can see that the higher my homocysteine levels and again this is a significant correlation as indicated there now if i remove b12 supplementation and limit omega-6 intake to the lower end of my range somewhere around 6 grams per day as opposed to the higher end of my range which you can see somewhere around 25 grams per day it's possible that i can reduce glucose while not increasing homocysteine but as an important part of that story we need to know that correlation for omega-6 intake with glucose and then also what's the big picture effect of removing or limiting omega-6 on the rest of my biomarkers so that's what we can see here and first starting with the correlation for omega-6 with glucose we can see that they are not significantly correlated which is good news if i reduce b12 and limit omega-6 to somewhere around six to six to seven grams per day it's possible i can reduce my blood glucose levels but what about the big picture so first relatively higher levels of omega-6 are correlated with a lower vldl which is good news because vldl also increases during aging and relatively higher levels of that are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk and the incidence of atherosclerosis so we want to keep that relatively low during aging but then conversely relatively high levels of omega-6 are correlated with four biomarkers four additional biomarkers going in the wrong direction so higher ast wrong direction again uh lower platelets again platelets decline during aging so we don't want them to go in that direction and then lower red blood cells but a higher mcv which again are both going in the wrong direction so the net correlative effect of a higher omega-6 intake in my data is five biomarkers going in the wrong direction including homocysteine ast platelets red blood cells and mcv and only one going in the right direction vldl so the net score there would be negative four so that suggests that i should limit my omega-6 uh intake not eliminate but limit it so then when considering the b12 supplementation correlations and the minimizing omega-6 uh correlations if i remove remove the b12 and limit my omega-6 that suggests that the overall effect on my biomarkers may be a net positive score of plus three including reduced glucose so that's my plan until the next blood test so stay tuned uh in at least in another month or so for that data all right if you're interested in more info for this approach and my attempts to biohack aging come join us on patreon and that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
