Gut bacteria impact skeletal muscle mass and function so let's start off by having a look at what antibiotic treatment does to muscle mass and function in young mice so antibiotics reduce gut bacterial content and we can see that here where on the y axis we've got micrograms of bacterial dna per gram of feces plotted against time in this case this was a four week study of antibiotic treatment in young mice and after one week of antibiotics we can see that gut bacterial dna content is reduced by 80 percent and it stays 80 reduced for the duration of the four week study all right so what's the impact of antibiotic treatment on muscle mass so we can see that data here we've got muscle weight on the wax y axis plotted against three different muscles the quadriceps quad gastrocnemius gas or tibialis anterior ta now these are lower leg muscles you can see that the quadriceps is located on the upper thigh the gastrocnemius behind the shin and the ta tibialis anterior in the front of the shin so for each of these three muscles we can see that they are reduced there the weight of these three muscles are reduced in antibiotic treated mice when compared with not treated uh it with antibiotics so antibiotic treatment in young mice reduces muscle mass all right so what about the effect of antibiotic treatment on muscle strength so we can see that data here when looking at muscle strength in the non-antibiotic treated versus antibiotic treated we can see that antibiotic treated had reduced muscle strength as indicated by grip strength so from this we can conclude that antibiotic treatment in young mice reduces both muscle mass and strength so how can gap gut bacteria impact muscle mass and strength so the authors of this study then looked at gut bacterial functions and this is just a small snapshot and i'll have a link to the paper in the video's description if you're interested in reading further so on the left we've got the untreated mice and on the right we've got bacterial gene counts for the antibiotic treated mice so orange is indicative of higher levels of bacterial gene counts and green is indicative of lower levels and more specifically you can see how that colors go there so as you go from orange to green it's higher gene counts to lower gene counts so what stands out is that both primary and secondary bile acids or gene counts or functions bacterial functions for primary and secondary bile acids are higher in the non-antibiotic treated when compared with antibiotic treated in other words there are lower levels of gene counts for bile acids in the antibiotic treated mice so that raises the question could bile acids base be involved in mechanisms that impact muscle mass and strength now having differences for bacterial functions doesn't always translate into metabolite levels but the authors of this study looked at total levels of bile acids the metabolite levels in the cecum so the cecum is the beginning of the large intestine as indicated there and what we can see is that antibiotic treated mice have a dramatic reduction in bile acid levels in the cecum uh so we've got somewhere around 350 micrograms per gram of bile acids and it goes to less than 50 in the antibiotic treated mice so but that doesn't indicate which specific bile acids are decreased remember bile acids are split into primary and secondary they're not all the same metabolites so here we're looking at bile acid composition in the antibiotic treated on the right versus the non-treated and we can see by the different colors that antibiotics alter bile acid composition so in the non-treated uh with antibiotic mice we can see that the major bile acids are deoxycolic acid dca in purple and omega muricolic acid in orange omega mca in contrast when looking at the bioelastic composition in the antibiotic treated mice you can see a completely different color scheme with the two major bile acids being taro colic acid tca and purple and taro beta muricolic acid tbmca in light blue now if we only looked at the bile acid composition in this figure we would think that the levels may be the same but remember the bile acid levels in at least the cecum were almost completely wiped out in the antibiotic treated mice so are absolute levels of toro beta mca different when comparing the antibiotic treated with with the non-treated mice and that's what we can see here levels of taro beta miraculic acid um in feces and this is in the cecum so we can see that toro beta mca is significantly higher in fact it's almost 20 fold higher in the antibiotic treated mice when compared with the non-treated mice which then raises the question could tauro-beta muricolic acid negatively impact muscle mass and or strength so to give away the answer it may be and more specifically toro beta-myricolic acid tbmca is involved in a mechanism that reduces muscle mass as shown in the figure here so with when starting with antibiotics i showed you that gut bacterial content or gut bacterial dna is reduced by 80 and in antibiotic treated mice muscle mass and although it's not shown here uh grip strength or muscle strength is also reduced so what's the mechanism how do you go from having less gut bacterial dna content to less muscle mass and strength so we saw that levels of toro beta murcolic acid are increased in the cecum so why is that important well toro beta mca is an inactivator of the farnazoid x receptor fxr as shown there in the intestine and we can see that more specifically here by looking at the percentage of fxr activation as a function of concentration on the x-axis for two different bile acids including toro beta mca so as the toro beta mca concentration increases we can see that fxr activation decreases so what's the link though for having less fxr with muscle mass or strength so when intestinal fxr is active fgf15 or fgf19 which is the human version of fgf15 which is found in mice is released into the blood so active intestinal fxr fgf15 or fgf19 released into the blood so but note that relatively higher levels of torah beta mca inactivate fxr which leads to less fgf15 or 19 in the blood and we can see that here so we're looking at plasma levels of fgf15 in in the antibiotic treated mice versus the nontreated mice and what we can see is that the antibiotic treated mice have a significant reduction for plasma levels of fgf15 which goes in line with this mechanism for less uh more toro beta mca uh less fxr activation less fgf15 being released into the blood so what's the link for fgf15 or 19 with muscle so fgf19 increases muscle mass and strength in young mice and that's what we're going to see here and i apologize for the blurry images this is exactly a screenshot from the paper that's how the paper's images look so here we're looking at muscle weight again for those three muscles quadriceps gastrocnemius and ta and now we've got three groups so vp blue circles no antibiotic treatment ap antibiotic treated and if you remember muscle mass for each of these muscles was significantly reduced in the antibiotic treated mice when compared with untreated but now we've got a third group af which is antibiotic treated fgf19 again this is the human version of fg of fgf19 that was then injected into mice and it was injected uh just under the skin uh subcont subcutaneously and what we can see is in that af treated mice so mice that were injected with fgf19 there were significant increases in muscle mass for each of these three muscles in antibiotic treated mice all right so what about muscle strength so once again we can see that antibiotics reduced muscle strength and when looking at the orange versus the blue circles antibiotic treated versus untreated but in the fgf19 treated antibiotic or fgf19 treated antibiotic treated mice there was a small but significant increase in muscle strength as shown there so from that we can see that fgf19 increases muscle mass and strength in young mice so what about aged mice fgf19 also increases muscle mass and strength and age mice as we can see here so now we've got also three groups and we're looking at muscle weight on the y-axis plotted against uh the soleus and the tibial tibialis anterior ta so we haven't introduced the soleus yet but that's a muscle that's located on the back of the shin just under the gastrocnemius and it's a long muscle so uh again three groups six month old mice open circles black squares 25 month old mice and these are old mice and what we can see is that during aging there's reduced muscle mass of the soleus and ta 25 month old mice versus six month old mice but now we've got that third gr third group again old mice treated with fgf19 and what we can see is that there's significantly increased muscle mass for both of these muscles in old mice that were treated with fgf19 all right so what about muscle strength so they looked at grip strength and first when looking at the aging effect we can see that uh aged mice have about half of the grip strength when compared with young mice six month old mice and then aged mice that were treated with fgf19 had significantly increased grip strength as shown there by the green arrow all right so this then raises the obvious question can fgf 19 treatment improve muscle mass and strength in older adults and unfortunately there aren't any rcts that have evaluated that question yet all right so to recap as a mechanism for decreased muscle mass and strength at least in antibiotic treated mice a bile acid toro beta mca reduces fxr activation thereby reducing fgf 15 19 which then raises the question can other bile acids increase fgf19 signaling in contrast with the data we saw in this video where it reduced a specific bile acid lead to reductions in fxr activation and fgf 15 19 signaling are there other bile acids that can increase fgf19 signaling thereby increasing muscle mass and strength or maybe even other pathways that bile acid bile acids can impact that could increase muscle mass strength so i've got a video in mind so stay tuned for that data all right that's all for now
