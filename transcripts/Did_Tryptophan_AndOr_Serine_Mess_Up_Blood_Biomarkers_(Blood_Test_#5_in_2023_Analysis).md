# Did Tryptophan And/Or Serine Mess Up Blood Biomarkers? (Blood Test #5 in 2023 Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number five in 2023 when using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator pheno age we saw what looks like an outlier especially when compared against the last eight tests as this test was about five years worse than that previous eight test average moreover it's been about 20 tests since i had a data point that was as bad as this test going back to 2020. So with that in mind what's contributing to these data so first let's take a look at supplements that corresponded to this dietary period for blood test number five so if you're familiar with the channel i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine 137 and a half micrograms per day since then i also supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day in most of the for most of the year in boston for this test for 19 of the 47 days that correspond to this test i supplemented with vitamin d now more specifically for that 47 day period it started on july 5th so that's immediately after blood test number four and it lasted until august 20th the day before blood test number five so for that 47 day period i'm going to show averages for dietary data and supplements in this video all right so over the first 19 days of that dietary period i supplemented with niacin and tryptophan to potentially impact nad 828 milligrams per day of niacin 737 milligrams per day for tryptophan and that didn't raise didn't further raise nad relative to niacin alone and if you missed that video it'll be in the right corner but then i tried not a tryptophan alone taking niacin out for 28 days before the test i only supplemented with tryptophan 2 grams per day and no supplemental niacin and i'll have an update video on that coming relatively soon in terms of whether or not it affected nad now my tryptophan intake from food is about one gram per day on a hundred grams of protein per day and that data is generated by chronometer so this additional 2 grams of tryptophan per day brings my total to three which is about a 300 increase relative to my baseline in other words that's a super physiological dose could that have negatively impacted my blood biomarkers thereby resulting in a worse biological age score now i also supplemented with searing the amino acid serine and vitamin b6 or paradoxical 5-phosphate p5p for this test for that 47 day period it was 5.7 grams of serine per day and about 26 milligrams of vitamin b6 per day and i use that combination to potentially reduce homocysteine again i'll have an update on that coming soon update video for that coming soon now my dietary serum intake is 3.8 grams per day again data generated by a chronometer so with supplementation adding that 5.7 grams per day brings me to or brought me to 9.5 grams of searing per day which is at 2.5 fold increase above baseline in other words a 250 percent increase above my normal non-supplemented intake for serine so that raises the question did too much supplemental tryptophan and or serine mess up blood biomarkers for this test especially when considering that my data is not generally very variable this is this data is looks like an outlier so why trying to get towards why that could be the case so i can learn from it and potentially minimize this occurrence going forward that's the goal so to address that we'll need to take a look at diet and more specifically what diet composition corresponds to this test and that's what we'll see here average daily dietary intake for that 47 day period that corresponds to test number five with the first 25 foods listed here so i rank them in order for so from 1 to 25 in terms of grams with the exception of green tea at number 22 which is in ounces but then what's different test over test so if that will pull up test number four and note that test number four has a 70 72 day period in between blood tests so test number three was on april 23 24th test number four was on july 5th so there's 72 days in between blood tests and then we can compare with a two-sample t-test the 40 intake for the 47 days versus the 72 days to see what might be different test over test so when doing that first we can see that watermelon intake with significantly different test number five versus test number four but note that that's only a two gram difference higher for test number five resulting in a one percent difference statistically significant test over test but this is a minor change relative to the 250 to 300 percent increase for searing and or tryptophan i also increased almond intake by about 3 grams which is a 14 increased level of almonds and test fibers test number four and i did that to try to impact dhea sulfate and i'll have a little bit more on that later i also increased flaxseed intake to get more alpha linoleenic acid ala so ala has been shown to activate p bar alpha which may impact nad so for the close to the end of the test that increased flaxseed intake which is why we can see that it was significantly higher test over a test but note even with that small increase it's still only 21 higher again not within the magnitude of the differences for serine and tryptophan and then i purposely reduce walnut intake following correlations with my dietary data for omega-6 with blood biomarkers showing which shows suggest that too much omega-6 in my diet may be bad for more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i reduced walnut intake but again that's about a 21 reduction still 15 times lower than the magnitude of the tryptophan increase and again these are minor changes relative to the amino acid supplementation for serine and tryptophan so this is the first half of the diet what about the other half now we can see the other 25 foods as shown here and again ranked in grams but we want to know what's different test over test so let's take a look at test number four's foods 426 that were ranked 26 to 50 for that test and then in terms of what's different test over test brazil nuts are right at that border of statistical significance with that p-value of 0.05 but note that that's a 0.1 gram difference 7.4 versus 7.3 grams again a very minor dietary difference test over test i also included jalapenos for test number five versus test number four didn't have any so that's only one about one gram per day very minor dietary difference test over test and then there were foods that were only for test number four or only for test number five first grape seed powder was only found in test number four as i was trying to impact nad levels and that didn't work that video will be in the right corner if you missed it i also had peanut butter as a part of my cheat meal for that dietary period peanut butter was not in test number five but in contrast that included cashew butter as a part of two cheat meals but more on that in a second so you can see that so far there are minor dietary differences at most around 20 percent still nothing within that magnitude of 250 or 300 percent increase as we see for or saw for searing or tryptophan and we can see that difference for serine just look at looking at test over test 5.7 grams versus 4.1 grams so even just looking at the 1.6 gram increase that alone is a 40 about a 40 increase more than for any food in either higher or lower and similarly tryptophan at 1.1 grams and note that i didn't have tryptophan for a a small period during that 47 day period but again exactly two grams for the 28 days before this test it it wasn't included in test number four and that's why we see that the p-value is less than 0.05 now my diet is not always clean i do include cheat meals i find that if it's always clean if i try to have it always clean and no cheat meals that can lead to a binge and i'm trying to avoid those as much as possible as too many calories may be the worst thing for blood biomarkers so for this test on those two separate days it included cashew butter mixed with m m's on one day and then cashew butter about 100 grams mixed with reese's peanut butter cup on the other day now when calculating the sum of the calories from m m's and peanut butter cup that's 834 calories which is less than one percent of all calories for this 47 day period in other words the diet is usually around 99 clean with just a little bit of junk now this list is ranked in grams which foods are top contributors for calories and that's what we'll see here so starting it off note that these data are tracked by chronometer and if you want to track your own data there'll be a discount link in the video's description to use chronometer now in terms of average daily calorie intake that was 21.22 per day and if you're familiar with the channel i've been saying that for many tests going back to 2020 has been purposely cutting my calories by just a small amount for a very long period of time with the goal of getting lean and staying lean not not reverting back to higher body weights so this is my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015 with blood test number fours average 2145 being the previous low so in terms of the top contributor for calories once again it's sardines and then without going through everything on the list note that nine of these top 10 foods for my calorie intake were the same as for test number four so no major differences in terms of where i'm getting my calories from test over test which could implicate serine and tryptophan once again as the potential factors that negatively impacted this blood test data all right so what about macronutrients we've gone through calories how about protein carbs and fat so starting with average daily protein intake it was about 101 grams per day 19 of total calories and for test number four that average was about 99 grams so when using a two sample t-test for the 47 day period for test number five and the 72-day period for test number four these differences were not significant so protein intake was similar test over test you can see the p-value is 0.18 when it's less than 0.05 that's statistically significant at least nominally without adjusting for multiple comparisons all right so some have asked where i'm getting 100 grams of protein from so i decided to include that for this video so which foods contributed to protein intake and that's we can see here it shouldn't be a surprise that the top contributor is sardines as they're the top contributor for calories and then i get a good amount of protein from collard greens from yogurt you can see serine contributed about six grams per day almonds mushrooms flax seeds beets steel cut oats and carrots all right so what about fat intake how does that compare test over test and that's we'll start off with here for test number five so we can see that the average daily fat intake was about 81 grams per day 34 and a half percent of total calories but again how does this compare with test number four if we're gonna see if diet was different test over test to potentially implicate serine and or tryptophan as the confounding factors for this blood these blood test results and as we can see here so daily average daily fat intake for test number four where fat intake average daily fat intake about 80 grams per day 33.6 of total calories and rather than rather than just looking at averages we can see that based on the p-value although it's relatively close they're not statistically different so 81 grams versus 80 grams no difference basically for fat intake test over test the investigating further fat isn't just one homogeneous type of fat there's monounsaturated polyunsaturated trans fats etc so how does that compare so we can see that monounsaturated fat was about 2 grams higher for this test and significantly higher but note that again two grams higher on the backdrop of test four test number four 18 grams that's an 11 difference still not within that ballpark of what was what what was higher for searing and tryptophan and then going we can see that omega-3 was higher for this test as i purposely increased it towards the end of the test getting more flax seed with the goal of increased any or potentially increasing nad through p par alpha activation and again update video on that coming relatively soon and that was a significant difference so significantly higher omega-3 but to reiterate that's less than one gram on the backdrop of test number four is nine grams you know that's again 11 different different that's not a 250 or 300 percent difference very minor difference and then we can see that omega-3 was less by less than one gram again so this is a less than five percent difference although it's significant test over test minor dietary difference and then uh so total polyunsaturated fats were not different test over tests neither were saturated fats and i don't track trans fat because i basically don't eat any total cholesterol dietary cholesterol wasn't different test over test either so once again we can see that there are relatively small dietary fat changes test over tests so but to so note that although there are some changes i do intend to try to bring total fat back to 80 grams omega-6 back to 16 grams but i'm gonna have omega-3 go higher as i'm trying to increase nad through more omega-3 but this time i'm not going to use flaxseed which is a source of ala i'm going to use epa and dha so expect to see that omega-3 higher than 10 grams per day but i am going to go to 9.2 grams per day with sardines and flax so anyway the point here is i'm going to get it to about 11 something grams per day with an additional 2 grams coming from omega-3 hopefully that doesn't mess up whatever tryptophan and serine messed up so stay tuned for that in an upcoming video all right next up is carb intake so first test number five and then test number four total carbs 286 for test number five which seems like a lot but remember net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake was 83.5 grams per day and when subtracting that from total carbs gives a net carbs of 203 grams per day we're compared with test number four that's significantly lower for test number five but again that eight gram difference on the backdrop of 200 and about 12 grams is again less than five percent difference a minor dietary change test over test also i track total fructose intake as i tend to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables on these on this diet we can see that total fructose for this test was 58 and a half grams per day and for test number four it was 58.1 grams per day not significantly different test over test and then although fiber was on the border of significance or close to significance 0.08 is close to 0.05 for a p-value that's still about a 2 2 gram difference on the backdrop of 86 grams i mean again that's a less than five percent difference even if it was statistically significant which it's not but it's a less than five percent difference test over test these dietary differences don't come close to the magnitude that i was able to impact with supplements for tryptophan and serine all right what about vitamin or mineral intake could those factors have impacted my blood test data for test number five so total vitamin intake and it may be hard to see so if you haven't gone full screen already i'd recommend doing that vitamin intake test number five and test number four so just highlighting what was different we can see that niacin was significantly higher for test number five versus test number four but this is a little bit misleading because as i mentioned i did supplement with niacin for the first 19 days of this test but for the remaining 28 days there was no niacin and i find it hard to believe that four weeks of noniacin or the first 19 days of niacin are going to affect the test four weeks later i find that hard to believe but nonetheless it's a potential factor similarly uh vitamin b6 was significantly lower by about 10 milligrams per day but note that both of these are still above my baseline of three grand three milligrams per day i find it hard to believe that b6 negatively impacted my data because b6 has been at least eight times higher than my baseline for the last two tests so it's been in the ballpark i find it hard to believe that would be a contributing factor to the potential outlier data for blood test number five and then vitamin d was significantly lower test five versus test number four but i account for that by getting sun exposure in boston as much as i can whenever their sun full body sun exposure so i doubt that this reduction of about 600 ius per day made a dent as again i'm getting full body sun exposure vitamin d was significantly different but again that's a 0.5 milligram increase test over test and i did that on purpose because in my data i was trying to get a boost for dhea sulfate as vitamin e was one of the is one of the dietary variables that has the strongest correlation with dhea sulfate in my data so i try to increase it by a little bit so that's where you get the additional 0.5 milligrams per day but nonetheless that's still a less than three percent difference test over test i find again and i know i'm repeating myself i find it very hard to believe that minor dietary difference would have affected the overall blood biomarker profile all right so that's it for vitamins nothing else with significantly different test over test what about minerals that's we can see here test number five minerals test number four mineral intake and here for each of these minerals that are shown the p-value was greater than 0.05 for all comparisons in other words mineral intake was not different when comparing test five first test number four circumulative sorry cumulatively when looking at macros micros and individual dietary intake in terms of foods we can see that there were minor changes at most around 20 percent different whereas the differences for syrian and tryptophan if i haven't hammered that home by now we're 250 to 300 percent higher than my baseline so i think those are the most likely factors and correspondingly for the next test which i've scheduled for sometime in october i've taken out tryptophan i've taken out serine and i've taken out vitamin b6 so if those were negatively impacting this most recent blood test we'd expect that my data should go back to those further reductions for biological age for test number six but also for the next test i've added omega-3 2 grams per day and methyl b12 as a means for reducing homocysteine hopefully it won't mess up other biomarkers but stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about
