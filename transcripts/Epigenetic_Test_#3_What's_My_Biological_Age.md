# Epigenetic Test #3: What's My Biological Age?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Last month i sent blood for epigenetic analysis so with that in mind what's my biological age in this video we'll cover epigenetic data for three tests henna dunedin pace and horvath and that data was generated by the company true diagnostic if you're measuring your own epigenetic data there'll be a true diagnostic discount link in the video's description now in an earlier video for each of these epigenetic tests i presented their correlation with chronological age and their association with all cause mortality risk so i won't go into that in this video if you're interested in seeing that data that video will be in the right corner so check it out but in this video we'll identify what's good what's bad and then are there potential contributing factors to my epigenetic data so first up is the hannum extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or eea and the hanum test is a marker of immune system aging so for the october test we can see that my epigenetic age was 40 years which is 10 years younger than my chronological age now superficially 10 years younger than my chronological age is good news but this data isn't as good as my hantum age for test number one and test number two and we can see that here first in the may test on the may test we can see that my hannah age was 36.87 years which is 12 years younger than my chronological age and then for test number two my hand epigenetic age was 37.47 years which also was 12 years younger than my chronological age so for this most recent test it was two to three years older when compared with tests one and two so some good news but also some bad news next up the need and pace so dunedin pace is data that was generated from the dunedin study and pace refers to the pace of aging calculated from the epigenome so my dunedin pace epigenetic age was 0.89 for this october test so what does that mean so on the left we've got the slowest epigenetic aging rate of 0.6 and what that means is that for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years conversely 1.4 would be the fastest epigenetic aging rate and that means that for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years so a dunedin pace value of 0.89 years is good news for this test but it's not as good as the data that i got for test one and two and we can see that here first for the may test my donita pays value was 0.8 and then for the july test it was 0.82 so once again some good news but then also some bad news but now the worst news of them all is my horvath data so what we're going to see is horvath's intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration also known as iea and the horvath test is a marker of cell intrinsic aging so for the october test for this most recent test we can see that my horvath epigenetic age was 56.34 years which is seven years older than my chronological age so this is my worst horvath epigenetic age data over the past three tests which also weren't very good for example for test number one in may we can see that my horvath epigenetic age was 55 which was six years older than my chronological age and then similarly although it was a relatively better result for the july test my horvath epigenetic age was 53.5 years but still it was all four years older than my chronological age so i've got some room for improvement a lot of room for improvement with my horvath epigenetic age now the next question then is how can i reduce my epigenetic age using horvath's test and get back to my best data not just for horvath but for the other epigenetic tests now a big part of my approach is looking at correlations so i don't yet have enough epigenetic data this is only three tests once i get to about five tests i'll start looking at correlations but i can potentially gain insight by comparing differences for a certain amount of time before each test and comparing to see if there are differences test the test for that period so more specifically what was different for the 30-day period prior to test two and three so first starting off with body weight this is again 30 days before each test i weigh myself every morning after using the bathroom so after going number one and number two so for the test number two my average body weight was 151.5 pounds whereas for test number three it was 152.2 pounds now just besides looking at averages between two groups of data when comparing them with a two sample t-test these two groups of data are significantly different so in other words my body will be significantly higher prior to test number three relative to test number two but that that then raises an interesting question is a small body weight increase enough to worsen epigenetic age and also is body weight the only factor that may have affected epigenetic age so to evaluate that i looked at 93 variable variables for the 30-day period prior to test two with test number three and those variables include cardiovascular metrics sleep sleep metrics so total sleep and individual sleep stages and both of those data cv metrics and sleep are generated by myfitness tracker macro micronutrients and individual food amounts as we all know i track diet so 93 variables compared for the 30-day period before test number two with test number three and we can see what's what's significant here when looking at test number two on the left versus test number three on the right so uh just uh to introduce uh the st what's statistically significant or not here obviously we've got the p-value but as a quick side step with the p-value less than 0.05 as the threshold for significance we can expect to see one false positive at least one false positive per 20 comparisons so when we have a hundred comparisons as almost 93 is pretty close to 100 in this case we could expect five false positives so to account for that we can include a false discovery rate or compute the false discovery rate which is also known as an adjusted p-value so computing the fdr accounts for this issue of multiple comparisons so in what we're looking at here in this table are variables that were different with a p-value less than 0.05 but then also with a relatively strict false discovery rate of 0.1 so what's significantly different we can obviously see that body weight was different as shown on the left but also on the table from test number two to test number three but then atop the list we can see brazil nuts and more specifically selenium which is uh my largest source of brazil nuts contain a large amount of selenium so i'm getting most of my daily selenium from brazil nuts that was significantly different from test number two to test number three now whether that's impacting epigenetic age i don't know but i plan on keeping my brazil nut and selenium intake relatively higher or higher than they were for test two for test number four so we'll see if that if this is correlation or causation also significantly different for the 30-day period prior to these two epigenetic tests were my cardiovascular fitness metrics resting heart rate rhr and heart rate variability hrv and these both of these are going in the wrong direction and in conjunction with worse epigenetic data so for the resting heart rate we can see that that went up from 44 to 45.5 and the heart rate ability went down from 65 to about 59. So worst cardiovascular fitness metrics relatively worse epigenetic age at least by correlation then also we can see that sleep was different for each of these 30-day periods prior to these two tests but not how you how you'd expect for example both light sleep and total sleep were significantly higher prior to test number three for the 30-day period relative to test number two so for test number two versus three we can see that light sleep was 2.9 hours versus 3.5 hours for test number three so i got more light sleep but somehow worse epigenetic age and similarly total sleep was also 7.6 versus 7.2 now also we can see that calories are significantly different for the 30-day period priorities to tests but also again not as one would expect in fact calorie intake was significantly lower prior to test number three which is arguably my worst epigenetic data one would expect that a higher calorie intake would be associated or correlated with worse epigenetic data but for at least for these two tests that's not the case but the biggest trend or pattern in these data seems to be related to fat intake so with all the red arrows we can see brazil nuts monounsaturated fatty acids mufa total nuts and seeds peanuts and then at the bottom total fat each of these were significantly higher for the 30-day period prior to test number three versus test number two which suggests that total fat intake may be worse or or bad for my epigenetic age now to test that for the next epigenetic test i'll reduce my fat intake from below about 87 grams per day for test number three somewhere closer to 81 grams per day a which is what my test number two value was and if correlate correlation equals causation if epigenetic age improves in conjunction with the reduced fat into intake that would add some strength to that hypothesis but then the key is will i improve epigenetic age with a relatively lower fat intake without messing up all the other blood biomarkers so stay tuned for that data all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go those discount links that i mentioned including epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
