# Foods That Could Increase NAD: Fenugreek Seeds

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Trigonelline which is otherwise known as one methyl nicotinic acid increases ned levels in mice and if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner but what about in people in part two of the series for foods that could increase nad we'll take a look at fenugreek seeds and that's because they contain trigonelline in this study 262 trigonelline was in fenugreek seeds in other words 2.6 mg of trigonelline per gram of fen fenugreek seeds and note that that's times more than chickpeas which was in part one of this video but in two other studies they've been shown to have a lot more trigonelline than in this first study in the first 91.2 mig of trigonelline per gram fenoc creek seeds and in the second 98.4 so when considering the lowest dose 2.6 milligram of trigonelline per gram fenugreek seeds i then added them to the diet to see if i could increase nad levels so for 11 days before testing i added an average of 21 g of of fen greek seeds into the diet and first i tried them raw and almost broke my teeth so then i ground them and added them to a cooked mix that i eat every day and when multiplying 21 gram per day by the trigonelline content the lowest trigonelline content in fenu greek seeds that yields 55 gram of tranelli per day but other stuff from the diet also contributed albeit lesser amounts including banana barley chickpeas oats and oranges which added an additional 13 milligrams of trigonelline per day to yield a total of 68 mig per day but nonetheless 55 milligrams coming from venu greek seeds is almost all of the 68 milligram of trigonelline so then did 68 milligram of trigonelline per day impact nad levels so to address that on for a february 2nd test i sent blood to gfinity for ned analysis and if you want to measure your own ned levels there's a discount link in the video's description so on that day nad was 26.6 micromolar and this is only a minor n ned increase if at all it could be test to test variation and we can see why that's true by taking a look at all of my ned results over the past 13 months which is shown here so starting with the most recent test 68 mig of trigonelline 26.6 micromolar in comparison with the last test mostly driven by chickpeas 27 mig of trigonelline so why didn't i get a bigger increase for nad with a big a more than double or more than doubling for trigonelline intake well as i was making this video earlier in the week i came across a fourth study where tri trigonelline content in fenu greek seeds was 1300 parts per parts per million in other words only 1.3 milligrams per gram uh for so 1.3 milligrams of trigonelline per gram of fenur greek seeds which could knock the trigonelline content down from 68 to about 40 milligram per day now that may be what happened here as i'd expect going from 27 to 40 milligrams of trelian relatively small increase and then a relatively small increase for nad 25.6 to 26.6 that could be what happened or again it could be normal test to test variation now without n precursors note that my highest value has been 25.6 micromolar that was both for the chickpea test for the last month and also for the my first ever test now without any any precursors it's never been n has never been higher than 26 micromolar this is again why i say this is at best a minor nad increase as it's never been higher than 25.6 and here i've got 26.6 now note that for one of those tests though it was 18.5 micromolar which raises the possibility that increasing dietary trelian intake may have helped push my ned levels blood intracellular ned levels towards the higher end of my range which is again 25.6 micromolar without n precursors so at least now with without any precursors the higher end of of my range may be 26.6 micromolar helping keeping me away from 18.5 micromolar and just to illustrate with ned precursors ned has always been greater than 26 micromolar as we can see on all of those tests there with the exception of one test 300 mig of nmn per day didn't make a dent 25.3 micromolar so when considering that fenu greek seeds didn't impact nad is the trigonelline nad experiment over and for now i wouldn't say it's over i've temporarily paused it i've added other things to the diet that have trigonelline like alala sprout sprouts and i'm thinking about making my own sprouts because they're pretty expensive $5 for 100 gram and i've been when i say added them to the diet not five or 10 grams but close to 100 grams per day so it can get expensive so i may have to grow my own sprouts if i grow my own sprouts there'll be a part three to this series for foods that could potentially increase ned with a focus on alphalpha sprouts all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to bioh aging check us out on patreon

coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die tring brand as i've got on here that and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
