# 17y Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Blood Test #1 in 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that my biological age when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age was about 17 years younger than my chronological so what may be contributing to these data so let's start off with supplements and if you're familiar with the channel the first two shouldn't be a surprise i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early 20s so i've been taking prescription leo thyroxin since then 137 a half micrograms per day and then in the non-summer months so 8 to nine months out of the year i supplement with the thousand i use of vitamin d and you can see that for all 49 days that correspond to this test i supplemented with vitamin d so more about that 49-day period so that it starts or started on the day after the last blood test which was which was on november 27th of 2023 and lasted until the day before this blood test which was january 14th of 2024 so from the immediately after the last blood test to the day before this blood test is a 49-day period i also supplemented with meth folate 400 microg per day but only 18 of the 49 days that correspond to this blood test as i added other stuff into the diet that has folate so i thought it would be wise to take out the supplement and i also supplemented with methyl b12 1,000 micrograms per day for all 49 days of this period because that's significantly correlated with lower homosysteine in my data i also supplemented with nicotinic acid but only for two of the 49 days in this period in part because i don't want to supplement it supplement with it all the time knowing that it could could impact the epigenetic pace of aging otherwise known as d and pace but i think that there may be some value in supplementing with it on exercise days as that may be the uh when i need the biggest uh nad boost or uh the the biggest effect of nad restoration by including some nicotinic acid now interestingly i also discovered in my data that a relatively higher niin intake including supplemental nicotinic acid is significantly associated with a higher heart rate variability and a lower wrestling heart rate which is good news because that's closer to youthful status and that's after adjusting for body weight and i posted that data on patreon i may include that in a video at some point in the future and that's it for supplements no other purported gero protectors or senolytics which then brings us to diet and more specifically what diet composition corresponds to blood test number one in 2024 and that's what we'll see here this is we're going to see the average daily dietary intake for the 49-day period that corresponded to this blood test and note that i track all of my uh daily diet by weighing it first on a food scale entering it into chronometer and then manually entering all of that data into an excel spreadsheet where i can then line up each blood test with a corresponding average dietary intake in terms of the foods that i ate for this 49-day period the average daily dietary intake we can see the top 25 foods here that are ranked in terms of grams with the exception of green tea which is announces and if you want to use what i use as a quick shout out there's a discount link for the company that i use it's organic loose leaf green tea sourced from japan so check that out in the video description if you want to use what i use all right so were there any experiments for this test and if you're familiar with the channel you'll know that my strawberry intake is usually around 600 grams per day so i purposefully cut that by about 150 grams uh and i'll get to that why in a second but i also cut yogurt because some of the strawberries i mix with uh with yogurt is kind of like an ice cream uh but so if i'm cutting the strawberries i also cut the yogurt out so i did that to get some calories to spend on other stuff to do a couple of experiments and one of those was the inclusion of oranges so why oranges oranges are a rich source of proline betane 510 micrograms per gram and that paper will be in the video description all the papers will be in the video's description that are referenced in this video so what is proline betane so we can see it structure there so uh the amino acid protein at its nitrogen atom you can see that there are two methyl groups so in other words proline betane is dimethyl proline in other words it can act potentially as a methyl donor for reducing homocysteine or potentially impacting methylation whether it's the horvath epigenetic test or d and pace at least that's the goal so from oranges based on the 63 grams per day average that i took in and when multiplying that by 5 510 micrograms per gram of oranges that yields 32 milligrams per day of proline betane in other words expanding my methyl donor pool and i know everybody or a lot of people talk about trimethyl glycine which under the same structural context is three methyl groups added to the nitrogen of the amino acid glycine in my case trimethyl glycine doesn't make a dent on homocysteine in the past i've tried up to three grams per day no effect so it may be possible that i'm saturated on how much trimethyl glycine i'm already eating because beets are a rich source and i need to expand the methyl donor pool by adding other amino acids that are either d or trimethylated for example another one is tryptophan ban in other words trimethyl tryptophan so i'll have more on that in an upcoming video so did adding oranges and their proline ban intake make a dent on homosysteine so homosysteine for this test on the january 15th test was 9.6 micromolar which there's room for improvement there but the previous 15 test average was 10.5 micromolar so moving in the right direction or just some random variability where it's lower than average nonetheless it's going in the right direction as i'd want want to see it closer to my youthful values some somewhere around 5 to six micromolar all right i also added chickpeas into the diet and not so much because of the recent video where i showed that legum fiber is associated or five grams of legum fiber is associated with a lower lower risk of all cause mortality but because chickpeas are a rich source of trigonelline also known as one methyl nicotinate so one methyl nicotinate has a methyl group that when trigel is converted into to nicotinic nicotinic acid can act as a methyl donor again potentially impacting homocysteine and other methylation related pathways thereby increasing my methyl donor pool now whether that actually is what can happen we'll see i'm waiting on epigenetic data but for the homocysteine data when considering the inclusion of chickpeas and oranges that it's going in the right direction i may be on to something so was there an impact on nad as the goal of in adding chickpeas was to increase trigonelline which can potentially increase nad and that data will be in the next video all right on to part two of the diet we can see that i consumed 48 different foods for this test and the same system ranked in terms of grams from 26 to 48 now also to get chickp into the diet i cut other foods that contribute to calories as the goal is to not increase calorie intake but to stay uk caloric or a little bit less and to do that i cut oats and barley intake they're usually around 25 to 30 gram per day so in total i cut the two of them together by by about about 50 gram per day to get chickpeas into the diet now the diet isn't purposefully always clean i do include cheat meals but at most i try to limit that to two per dietary period or two per 49 day period for this test it was chocolate chips mixed with sweeten condensed milk and peanut butter i i just i love homemade reese's peanut butter cups and i usually make it with chocolate chips melted melting the chocolate chips and adding that to peanut butter so for this test i decided to sweeten it up with literally sweetened condensed milk which which was pretty tasty too uh for the most recent testo i used honey so we'll see that in an upcoming video sometime in march now in terms of calories what this uh relatively lower nutritious food chocolate chips and sweet and condensed milk added to the diet 551 calories from the chocolate chips 476 calories from the sweet sweet and condensed milk and again that's over two different days that's not a small amount every day 49 days but two days where i had it and then 47 days i didn't have it at all no junk for 47 days so in terms of a percentage of the diet that's clean 99% clean 1% a little bit of junk that's what works for me other stuff may work for other people i let the biomarkers drive how often uh to have cheap meals in the approach and when i have when i if i go more than that now i start to run the risk of obsessing about junk food and potentially going off diet and messing up the biomarker so i'm not trying to do that too cheap meal seems to work well for me it may not be like that for others but that's how it goes for me all right so this list is ranked in grams what about foods ranked in terms of calories and that's what we'll see here top 10 foods for average daily calorie intake for the 49-day period that corresponded to blood test number one in 2024 and we can see that here and note that these data are tracked with chronometer if you want to track your own diet using chronometer there's a discount link in the video's description so in terms of the food that contributed the most in terms of daily calories it's sardines and then just quickly going through the list strawberries chickpeas flax seeds almonds carrots coconut butter collared greens beets and p pistachios round out for where i'm getting the majority of my daily calories which then brings us to macronutrient composition so first starting with calorie intake average daily calorie intake it was 2092 calories per day which if you're familiar with the channel you've heard me say this many many times but this is again my lowest calorie intake average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015 the previous low was 2106 and that was for test number 7even in 2023 and for those who may be new i've been slowly making very small cuts to the average daily calorie intake as it's easier for me to maintain that uh that weight loss that fat loss over a long period of time relative to in the past where i've made very big cuts to the calorie intake and got lean really quickly but wasn't able to maintain it and literally binge that weight back on so small cuts over a long period of time have uh enabled me to stay leaner for longer and not feel uh like i'm missing anything in the diet while still being satiated average daily protein intake for this test was 97 g per day in terms of percentage of calories in the diet it was 18.6% of total calories what about fat intake we can see that here average daily fat intake was 81.2 grams per day which is about 35% of total calories now something else that i'd like to highlight is when considering that my biological age data is consistently in the 15 to 17 years younger than my chronological age i'm not trying to blow up the system from test to test i'm trying to maintain that for every test test and one way that i do that is by trying to ensure that my macros are consistent for every test and we can see that by looking at the data for fat intake for the november 27th test which was test number s in 2023 and without going through each individual fat you can see that the data is remarkably consistent and that's done on purpose that's not by accident i aim to have consistency across the diet whether it's protein intake fat intake including monounsaturated polyunsaturated etc from test to test with the goal of um having my data my bi biomarker data be consistent also from test to test all right next up is carb intake so total carbs were about 283 gram per day which seems like a lot but net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake for this test was about 86 gram per day so in subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of about 197 gram per day when multiplying that by four calories per gr that yields a net carbs of about 38% of total calories now note that fiber also contributes calories to the diet around 2 calories per gram and that's because the soluble fiber fraction of fiber is converted into short chain fatty acids in other words a small percentage of fiber is converted into fats and with that in mind 185 calories from fiber which is about 9% of my diet or 9% of my total calories can be added to total fat so such that now we can calculate my net macros that correspond to this test my average daily net macros for that 49-day period of about 44% total fat 38% net carbs and 18% 18.6% uh total protein now note that within sugars i don't look at correlations for total sugars with biomarkers but i do look at correlations for total fructose as the diet has a lot of fructose containing foods and in my data for whatever reason relatively higher fructose intake is significally cor correlated with a lot more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i try to limit uh how much fructose that i take in while not completely eliminating it as it'll probably be virtually impossible because the foods that included impa impact uh how satiated that i am nonetheless total fructose for this test we can see that by adding fructose plus half of sucrose as sucrose is half fructose and when adding those two together we get a total fructose average daily intake of about 61 grams per day per day for this test now for comparison that's close to my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracting in 2015 which is 57.5 grams per day now i know that that still may seem like a lot but this is relatively half of my highest intake since i started tracking diet in 2015 so progress not perfection all right what about micronutrients what is that what do they look like in terms of how they correspond to this test for the 49-day period in average for this test and i won't i don't want to spend a lot of time on that i just want to put it up so people see that data so all of the vitamins posted there i'd encourage going full screen if you haven't already because they're very small and it may be hard to see if you're not on full screen and then mineral intake and what i'd like to highlight here for those who are interested in looking at the micronutrients is that i have full rda coverage that's essential i think to starting this process is making sure you're at least covering the rda but many micronutrients are purposfully much higher than the rda and that's because i'm following their correlations with multiple blood biomarkers and a few other biomarkers too like slow wave sleep and blood pressure all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you
