# Supplemental Tryptophan: Impact on NAD?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Nad declines during aging but fortunately there are at least three pathways that can be targeted to reverse the decline and that does include cd38 which i've covered in an earlier video two of those pathways are shown here including the price handler pathway and nicotinic acid n a which is converted by three enzymatic steps into nad and the salvage pathway including nmn but also nam niacinamide and nr nicotinamide riboside which are also converted into nad now anecdotally i know that these precursors increase nad for example a thousand milligrams per day of nmn increase my nad levels to 39 micromolar which is above my baseline of 20 to 25 micromolar similarly 654 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid increased nad to 67 micromolar again that's higher than that 25 20 to 25 micro molar range for my baseline but supplementing with nad precursors including nmn nicotinic acid niacinamide or nicotinamide riboside doesn't address why nad production declines during aging and the why behind that may lie in this pathway which is the day novo nad synthesis pathway now we know that nad declines during aging similarly tryptophan also declines during aging probably in part to try to maintain nad homeostasis so it's degraded to go through this pathway and in support of that we know that kind urinine increases during aging so that chinine increases but nad decreases suggest that there's potentially an age-related block in this pathway that limits conversion of chin uranine into the further downstream metabolites for conversion into nad now in earlier videos i explored that potentially vitamin b6 or circulated levels of plasma levels of vitamin b6 may be the limiting factor but increasing b6 by supplementation did not affect nad levels similarly quinolinic acid also increases during aging which suggests that there might be an age-related block in the conversion of quinolinate into nad so i've explored that too in earlier videos including grape seed proanthocyanidins which have been shown to increase qaprt so quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl phrase but that data was in mice and rats in my case grape seed grape seed powder did not increase nad so with that in mind that suggests that i may not have age-related blocks in the day no day novel entity synthesis pathway so to test that if i increase my tryptophan intake could i get a nad boost so i decided to supplement with 2 grams of tryptophan per day and note that my normal dietary intake is one gram per day so that's a three-fold increase in total to address that i sent blood to infinity and if you're interested in measuring your own your own nad levels discount link in the video's description and here we can see that data so in the presence of two grams per day of tryptophan nad levels were 22.3 micromolar which is right in the baseline range 20 to 25 micro molar that i've had in the absence of any nad precursors so to address the question did tryptophan impact nad unfortunately it did not now i haven't given up on the day novel pathway i've got one last experiment planned and that includes the fish oil fatty acids epa and dha and if you missed the rationale for that that video will be in the right corner i sent blood for analysis last week on september 11th so results should be in sometime soon so we'll know whether or not fish oil fatty acids can impact nad or not if they don't i'll probably have to go back to nicotinic acid albeit at a lower dose and i'll have the y for that coming in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts through biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification at home metabolomics epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with scifox health including apo b diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or diatron brand that link and all of the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
