Homocysteine increases during aging so let's check out that data so here we've got plasma levels of homocysteine plotted on the y-axis against age on the x and more specifically the age range goes from 12 year olds all the way up to older than 80 year olds and here we can see the age-related increase for homocysteine first for men and then also for women now note that youth homocysteine levels in youth are around 7 micromolar whereas they increase to about 12 micromolar in older than 80 year olds at least in this study now the reference range at least defined by quest lab is a homocysteine level less than 11.4 micromolar as potentially being optimal now if we put that line for 11.4 micromolar on this graph we can see that by only focusing on the reference range we would miss the age-related increase for homocysteine until 60 year olds 60 years old for men and 70 years old for women all right so what about older than 80 years how does homocysteine look in people that are older than 80. And here we're looking at a study of more than 1700 centenarians so people that had a median age of 100 years and here we can see that serum hcy so serum levels of homocysteine were 23.1 micromolar which would be even further off the chart when compared with the data that i just presented in other words if we live long enough we may all have elevated homocysteine now homocysteine is also important because all cause mortality risk increases as homocysteine increases and we can see that here in an all meta-analysis of six studies that looked at all cause mortality risks association with circulating levels of homocysteine so on the y-axis we've got relative risk or relative risk for all-cause mortality relative risk relative risk for risk of death for all causes plotted against homocysteine circulating levels of homocysteine on the x so when putting a hazard ratio of 1 on this graph we we can see the by the red line that as homocysteine levels increase all cause mortality risk is similarly increased now note that all cause mortality risk also increases at very low levels of homocysteine or at least it's associated with a very low levels of homocysteine are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so in other words as low as possible for homocysteine may be optimal at least in terms of all-cause mortality risk now investigating further elevated homocysteine which is defined as having homocysteine greater than 15 micromolar is it associated with the adverse health and or function of many organ systems and we can see that here so starting with homocysteine in the center with greater than 15 micromolar being defined as elevated homocysteine we can see that that's associated with adverse health and or function of the cardiovascular system of the brain of eyes and ears of the female reproductive apparatus of the pancreas bone and kidney so with that in mind what's my data so i have homocysteine data that goes back to 2005 so i have 29 blood tests over that span and when i first started tracking this was from 2005 to 2009 i tested six times over that time period and my average homocysteine was 7.1 micromolar so relatively youthful values when i was in my early to mid 30s and then i took about eight years off for measuring it because it's not commonly measured on a standard chem panel at least in the united states so when i started measuring again in 2017 i started measuring a lot more often so i have 23 blood tests since 2017 and my average homocysteine over that period is 10.2 micromolar now besides just looking at averages between two different time periods i compared them with a two sample t-test and when i did that we can see that these two groups of data are significantly different in other words i've experienced an age-related increase for home assisting so this is going in the wrong direction so with that in mind how can i reduce homocysteine so to answer that question let's have a look at homocysteine metabolism and that's what we can see here and there's a lot of data on this diagram so let's break it down piece by piece so first homocysteine levels can be decreased by a variety of ways starting with dietary folic acid that's then metabolized into serum levels of folate serum levels of folate in conjunction with vitamin b12 combined with homocysteine to convert it into methionine now also note that dietary intake of betaine also known as trimethylglycine can combine with homocysteine to also reduce homocysteine levels thereby forming methionine however methionine that increase in methionine will then be converted into s adenoscele methionine or sam which will then be converted into s adenoscele homocysteine sah and then acidencial homocysteine is converted back to homocysteine so this is basically a feudal cycle even with adequate levels of folate b12 and or betaine so even in the presence of these three vitamins folate b12 and betaine adequate b6 vitamin b6 and the amino acid serine are required to reduce homocysteine and we can see that here so when homocysteine combines with serine in the presence of adequate levels of vitamin b6 that assist the cis defining is then formed thereby reducing homocysteine levels so with that in mind with that in mind what were my levels at what was limiting in terms of homocysteine in my data is it a b12 is it folic acid is it betaine b6 or something else so for blood test number seven which i took two two weeks ago blood test number seven in 2022 my average daily intake as we all know i weigh everything weigh all my food i've been doing that since 2015. So i know my average daily intake of all my macros micros and individual food amounts my average daily intake of folate b12 and b6 is shown here so to put that into perspective we can pull up the rda for each of these vitamins and then we can see that i'm significantly above the rda for each of these three vitamins folate b12 and b6 so my folate intake is 2.5 fold higher than the rda b12 is about five times higher and b6 is about two times higher in other words none of these vitamins are deficient so is it possible that the levels of the amino acid serine could be sub-optimal thereby allowing homocysteine to accumulate and also another that raises another question will glycine supplementation increase the amino acid serine thereby reducing homocysteine so why glycine so to address that question let's take a look at another diagram in this case a few of glycine's metabolic pathways that it's involved in so here we can see glycine which is at the center of that and glycine is converted by one enzymatic reaction into serine and then serine combines with homocysteine as i just mentioned to form cystothionine now cystothynene is one enzymatic reaction away from forming the amino acid cysteine and that's important because cysteine is one of glutathions three component amino acids and cysteine can then be incorporated into glutathione by supplementing with glycine but then also glycine is a component of glutathione too so by supplementing with glycine glutathione levels may be boosted while also reducing home assisting levels which is what i've indicated here so supplementing with glycine may not only reduce homocysteine via its conversion to serine but it may boost gsh or glutathione synthesis too so will that actually be true so i started supplementing with glycine in mid december december 15th of 2022 and my first blood test of 2023 will be sometime in mid to late january so i just as a last note on this i think it's interesting because many people think that i'm anti-supplements but i'm not i prefer targeted supplementation and based on what i've shown in this video i think there's a good rationale to supplement with glycine now i'll pin in the comments why i'm going to start off with 2 grams where i got that amount from so if you're interested in that check it out if you're interested more about my attempts to buyer hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested with those links in the video's description so we've got discount links for epigenetic testing to test your oral microbiome composition to measure at home blood testing to use at-home blood testing to measure a panel of biomarkers diet tracking we've got a discount link for that or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee now we also have merch which is shown here and all these links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
