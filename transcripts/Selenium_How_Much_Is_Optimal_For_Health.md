Normal mitochondrial function generates reactive oxygen species ross including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 now these reactive oxygen species then oxidatively damage protein lipids and nucleic acids including dna and it can induce mitochondrial dna mutations the net effect of this damage and increased mutation load is mitochondrial dysfunction unfortunately mitochondrial dysfunction then imposes a vicious cycle on this process leading to the generation of more ross more damage and mutations and further decreased mitochondrial function now the sum of this process contributes to aging and to highlight this uh mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the nine hallmarks of aging so with this in mind removing h2o2 or hydrogen peroxide is important for minimizing the vicious cycle and notice i said removing uh and actually removing the excess not eliminating it's impossible to completely eliminate reactive oxygen species as just as a byproduct of oxygen-based metabolism we're going to produce uh superoxide uh which is a reactive oxy species which can be converted into h2o2 all right so how is h2o2 degraded now one mechanism for degrading it involves glutathione as shown here gsh so two molecules of glutathione uh are involved in the process that degrades h2o2 into water and during that process uh gsh becomes itself oxidized thereby forming one molecule of glutathione disulfide gssg now this reaction whereby h202 is degraded into water is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione peroxidase and the activity of this enzyme depends upon the mineral selenium so if selenium intake is deficient glutathione peroxidase will be suboptimal and hydrogen peroxide levels can accumulate so with this in mind uh how much is optimal for selenium in terms of health so the rda the recommended dietary allowance for selenium is 55 micrograms per day and what's shown here is the rda for selenium intake for various life stages starting from infants all the way up through adults and we can see that for adults the recommendation is 55 micrograms per day for adults older than 19 years now slightly higher amounts are are proposed for pregnant and breastfeeding women 60 and 70 micrograms per day respectively now these recommendations were derived based on the amount of selenium that maximizes glutathione peroxidase as an h202 degrading enzyme uh its activity but selenium impacts more than just gpx or glutathione peroxidase activity and that's what's shown here so starting from dietary selenium intake which influences circulating levels of selenium and then circulating levels of selenium uh impact selenoproteins so uh proteins whose activity depends on the presence of selenium and these proteins include not just glutathione peroxidase but thyrodoxin reductase trxr thyroid hormones that remove iodine groups so d-iodinases dio and then celano protein p and other selenium selenium dependent proteins the collective uh effect of these selenium dependent proteins are involved in mechanisms that affect immune function thyroid function that protect against oxidative stress and that influence inflammatory signaling pathways and in some these selenium-dependent proteins are involve the mechanisms that reduce all-cause mortality risk so with that in mind and when considering that the rda for for selenium was only based on glutathione peroxidase activity uh is 55 micrograms per day optimal for health so let's have a look at the data so here we see all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against uh dietary selenium intake on the x-axis and this is in a study of about 18 000 people and what we can see is that the lowest all-cause mortality risk was present when the dietary selenium intake was 125 micrograms per day which already were higher than that 55 microgram per day rda recommendation now studies data from other studies relating dietary or circulating levels of selenium with all-cause mortality risk acm supports the hypothesis that 55 micrograms per day of selenium is not optimal so let's look at that data so again in this study of about 19 000 people the group that uh averaged 71 micrograms of selenium per day had the highest all-cause mortality risk and groups that had higher levels of selenium intake 100 and 126 micrograms per day had lower all-cause mortality risk and the group that had the lowest all-cause mortality risk uh averaged a selenium intake of 183 micrograms per day now dietary studies are are interesting but they can suffer from under reporting or over reporting as people have to remember what they ate and how much of it in contrast circulating levels of selenium are a more objective measure of selenium intake because it you know people can say what they ate or what they didn't but what's in the blood is directly related to how much they ate how much selenium uh they they took in as we'll see in in a little bit so uh what about the data for circulating levels of selenium with all-cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here again all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the circulating selenium concentration on the x-axis and this is a meta-analysis of six studies with about 21 000 subjects and what we can see is that the lowest all-cause mortality risk was present when the circulating selenium concentration was 1.3 micromoles per liter now if we're going to convert this into a form that can uh be correlated with the dietary selenium intake we need to convert this first into micrograms per liter so one mole of selenium is 79 grams and when you multiply 1.3 micromoles per liter times 79 grams per mole we get 103 micrograms per liter so with that in mind what level of dietary selenium is correlated with 103 micrograms per liter of selenium in blood and that's what we can derive here so here we're looking at the correlation between serum selenium on the y-axis versus the dietary selenium intake on the x-axis in micrograms per day and what we can see is first that the higher the selenium intake the higher uh that was correlated with a higher circulating level of selenium all right so then the big question is what does 103 micrograms per liter in the previous meta analysis data what does that correlate to in terms of dietary intake and based on extrapolation based on the trend line we can see that that amount 103 micrograms per liter corresponds to 166 micrograms of selenium per day now note that these data for the circulating uh levels of selenium that were associated with lowest cost mortality risk are within that range uh that was uh identified in the dietary studies so 125 to 183 micrograms per day in the dietary studies 166 micrograms per day of selenium for the uh circulating selenium all-cause mortality study so then that also raises the question is there an upper limit so this is data from a five-year randomized control trial rct where people were supplemented with a placebo 100 200 or 300 micrograms per day of selenium and uh as i mentioned this was this study was done for five years so people got these supplements for five years so first obviously the baseline mortality data we can see they're obviously starting from the the same risk of death from from for all causes and then at the end of the five year period when looking at the brown line the 300 micrograms per day of selenium group we can see that there was some separation when compared with both all three of the other groups including the placebo but that data wasn't uh statistically significant however they followed these subjects for an additional 10 years after the five-year study so now it's a 15-year study and we can see that the group that had 300 micrograms but that was consuming that was supplemented with 300 micrograms per day of selenium now had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with placebo so the authors of this study rationalized that selenium toxicity may have been induced because of the 300 microgram per day dose within the first five years and then that persisted for 10 years after the study concluded uh so these data collectively suggests that 200 micrograms per day of selenium may be an upper limit but definitely or at least not 300 micrograms per day as there may be some increased all-cause mortality risk associated with that so with this in mind what's my data now i've been tracking my diet uh including weighing all my food and logging all of the macro and micro nutrients into an excel file since 2015. I've also been blood testing a lot since then so i have up to 30 blood tests that correspond to dietary intake over the past six years and when i look for correlations between my selenium intake with um biomarkers you know blood-based biomarkers that are found found on the standard chemistry panel uh and uh cbc the complete blood count and also things like homocysteine c-reactive protein and lipoprotein a uh we we can see that uh when my selenium intake is higher than 200 micrograms per day it's correlated with many biomarkers going in the wrong direction so i'm just going to illustrate a few of them uh here so first uric acid versus my average daily selenium intake we can see that the higher my average daily selenium intake the higher my uric acid level so what about this 200 microgram cutoff so we can see that as my selenium intake goes past that 200 microgram cutoff uric acid is increasing and note that this is a significant correlation based on the p-value now i haven't made a video about this yet but higher levels of uric acid are found during aging they increase during aging and there's a u-shaped association with all-cause mortality risk so very low levels of which my data is not in that range but also higher relatively higher levels are associated with an increased uh all-cause mortality risk so with the higher selenium intake that's correlated with uric acid going in the wrong direction and i'll link to those studies for uric acid in the video's description if you're interested now other biomarkers also are going in the wrong direction with higher selenium it takes greater than 200 micrograms per day and that's what we can see here so when i put the black line up right at that 200 microgram cutoff uh we can see that my rdw so red blood cell distribution with is uh it's correlated with an increase um for a the higher selenium intake now i have a video on this too and for the next two or three biomarkers if you're interested in that in the the data for how they change during aging and all-cause mortality risk i'll put them in the right corner so you can check those out but for this rdw's going in the wrong direction lower values are found in youth and are associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk so with this it looks like the higher my selenium intake past 200 micrograms per day that's correlated with rdw going in the wrong direction similarly for hdl which is shown here so as we get past as we get to that 200 microgram cutoff we can see that that's correlated with lower hdl and as i mentioned i have a video on hdl values uh in the 50 to 60 range are uh proposed to be optimal for men so actually that that the as i go towards 170 or so for selenium that seems to be correlated with relatively higher hdl whereas as i get past 200 it's going in the wrong direction towards lower hdl now i didn't put up any pictures for this but also alkaline phosphatase we see a positive correlation which means that the higher the selenium intake that's correlated with a higher alkaline phosphatase uh which is also going in the wrong direction because higher alkaline phosphatase increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so i've got four biomarkers that suggest higher selenium intakes higher than 200 micrograms per day may be bad for health now interestingly there's one that seems to be going in the right direction and that's glucose so as we can see as my selenium intake gets past about 200 micrograms per day my glucose levels are going down or correlated with going down and glucose increases during aging and higher levels of glucose are associated with increased more all cost mortality risk so this was this data would suggest that higher selenium it may be sending glucose in the right direction by whatever the mechanism so i didn't only look at these five biomarkers i also compared uh the other these other biomarkers that i've listed here 23 other biomarkers most of them i have up to 30 blood tests but some of them i have less 14 data points including c-reactive protein homocysteine lipoprotein a uh but note that none of the these 23 biomarkers were significantly correlated with my selenium intake so um so then this when considering that i've got data for four biomarkers going in the wrong direction and one going in the right direction and no effect on 23 then that's a net minus three so it seems like the very high levels of selenium at least past 200 micrograms in my data may not be optimal for health so last but not least uh and many of you may already know this which foods are selenium-rich so brazil nuts are the best source of selenium one gram of brazil nuts contains about 19 micrograms so with that in mind i eat one large brazil nut about five grams per day which gets me about 96 micrograms per day from brazil nuts so that's about half of my current intake and then i also get a significant amount of daily selenium from sardines as i eat sardines every day 80 grams 110 so i get 40 micrograms of selenium from that so between those two foods i get about 70 of my daily selenium about 180 to 190 micrograms per day to stay under that 200 microgram limit um in my intake all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end i hope you enjoyed the video and uh got value from it uh have a great day
