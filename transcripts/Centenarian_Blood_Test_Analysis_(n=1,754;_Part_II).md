What does centenarian blood test data look like in a relatively large cohort in part one of this video series we took a look at blood test data from the heinen centenarian study which included more than 1700 people that had a median age of 100 years so what about that blood test data well that's what's shown here and in part one we looked at eight biomarkers and classified them as good based on aging and all-cause mortality data but there's another eight biomarkers that we didn't cover so that'll be the focus of this video going over data for total cholesterol ldl red blood cells hemoglobin mcv liver enzymes ast and alt and hcy homocysteine so let's jump into the data so first total cholesterol tc which in the centenarians had a median value of 4.7 millimolar or 182 milligrams per deciliter so let's put that data into context by looking at the aging related uh how it changes with aging so here we're looking at total cholesterol on the y axis plotted against age which goes from 18 to 88 years and this is in a study of more than 12.8 million people so we can see that total total cholesterol levels increase for men in green and women in red and then they decrease during aging all the way up to 88 years as i mentioned which is the oldest age for this graph now to get to 100 years we'd have to do some extrapolation based on the aging related trends and when we do that we can see that centenarians would be expected to have total cholesterol levels in the 170 to 180 range which isn't too far from the high non-centenarian data of 182 milligrams per deciliter so from from that data we can potentially conclude that the centenarian total cholesterol data may be indicative of aged or or not youthful however we can also see that 182 for total cholesterol can also be found in youth for both men and women as shown there so from this data we can conclude that age-related total cholesterol data can't be used to indicate if 182 milligrams per deciliter is aged or youthful so what about all cause mortality data so that's what's shown here and this is from the same study and all the studies that will be that i'll reference in this video will be in the video's description uh so check it out if you're interested so this is a data for 75 to 99 year olds and we'd expect that that would have the most relevance to centenarian data for all cause mortality risk so first we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk acm was present in the 220 to 229 milligram per deciliter range so when taking a look at the centenarian median total cholesterol of 182 we can see that all-cause mortality risk in green for men was not significantly increased but it was significantly increased by five percent for women now note that for both men and women there was a significant increase for all-cause mortality risk when total cholesterol was lower than 170. So in terms of what's good uh and or bad uh total the centenary and total cholesterol for men may be neutral but bad for women so uh can we be more specific though by looking at centenarian levels of ldl and that's important because in part one of this video series we looked at hdl and triglycerides triglycerides can be used as a proxy for vldl so all that's left for that total cholesterol story is ldl so how does that look in the centenary data so the median ldl for the high non-centenarians was 2.8 millimolar which is equivalent to 108 milligrams per deciliter so context let's have a look at aging related data that's what's shown here average ldl from 18 to 88 years and this is in a study of more than 14.8 approaching 4 14.9 people so similar to the total cholesterol story once again we can see that h ldl sorry increases for both men and green women in red and then it decreases during aging so to get to 100 years we will have to do some a little bit of extrapolation based on the aging-related trends and when we do that it isn't a far stretch to see that the centenarians would be expected to have a ldl uh somewhere in the 100 to 110 milligrams per deciliter range which is pretty close to what we'd expect for the centenarians so is that indicative of aged values now it maybe not because we can also see 108 can be placed on these curves so both men again in green and women in red so from this data we can conclude that age-related data for hdl can't be used to indicate if that 108 is aged or youthful so what about all-cause mortality risk and again this is data from the same study unfortunately in this study they didn't break it down by age group so this is for the whole cohort that included that wide age range but all of these well this association was adjusted for age and other variables as we'll see in a minute so it should be okay so in terms of all cause mortality risk lowest risk was present in the 120 280 milligram per deciliter range for ldl and when we put the centenarian data into context for of 108 we can see that it's not at in the lowest risk range it's a little bit a little bit above that going in the wrong direction and considering the age-related trends for ldl we can posit that this is actually going in the wrong direction as we expect the ldl to further uh decrease for people that live longer than 100 years so in terms of what's good and or bad from this we can conclude that they have sub-optimal ldl a little bit away from the optimal but not optimal which is going in the wrong direction that's why i've put it down as leaning towards bat now note that this model was adjusted for many variables as included there but it wasn't adjusted for malnutrition which has been defined in some studies as low albumin and low lymphocytes and that's potentially important because in studies that relatively low ldl less than 100 milligrams per deciliter is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality risk uh it it may be because of malnutrition and i'll go into that a little bit more in a future video so stay tuned for that so moving along red blood cells rbcs median value was 4.2 trillion red blood cells per liter so let's put that data into context and that's what's shown here by looking at the aging related data for red blood cells all the way up to 95 years old in this study so we can see that red blood cells decline during aging with values of about 4.8 in men in green and about 4.3 in youth for women in blue that then declined during aging that reach about 3.9 uh trillion red blood cells per liter for a 95 to 100 year old so putting the centenarian high non-centenarian data into perspective well with their data of 4.2 we can see that for uh for men it could be indicative of a 70 year old what we'd expect to see in a seven-year-old but also it could be found in in around a 20 year old for a woman also it could be found somewhere in the 50 to 60 year range as you can see that curve for the women comes very close to 4.2 so from this we can conclude that the red blood cell levels for the heinon centenarians are up to 30 to 80 years younger than expected based on their hundred year chronological age so in terms of what's good we see that these centenarians have relatively youthful red blood cells however other red blood cell related measures are not good and starting that story off with hemoglobin centenary median values were 92.9 grams per liter and converting that into grams per deciliter it's 9.29 so that value is important 9.29 because we can see that all cause mortality risk is posted there when the reference was defined as 14 to 14.9 we can see that men that had uh hemoglobin levels less than 13 was associated with about a 50 percent increased all-cause mortality risk so we're off to a bad start there for the centenarians based on hemoglobin so what about data for women so when compared with the reference of 12 to 12.9 grams per deciliter for hemoglobin we can see that values less than 11 which these centenarians had this was associated with an all-cause mortality risk and increased risk for women in this study so in terms of what's bad we can conclude that these centenarians potentially have unhealthy levels of hemoglobin now next up on the red blood cell related measures is the mean corpuscular volume otherwise known as the mcv and that's essentially a measure of the size of red blood cells small red blood cells can only carry a small volume whereas larger red blood cells carry a larger volume and the centenary median data in this study was 120 femtoleaders fl as the units so the mcv increases during aging as we can see in this plot here so when going from 20 to up to 100 years old we can see that mcv increases during for men from values of about 86 femtoleaders and youth 20 to 30 years old up to 91. Similarly in women values around 87 increased to about 89 years as these people approached 100 years so when considering the centenarian data of 120 and the aging related data which is shown there an mcv of 86 to 87 would be considered youthful in men and women respectively we can see that these centenarians have a much larger red blood cell and a larger volume so with an mcv of 120 is shown there so what's the consequence of having in a higher mcv so to evaluate that we can look at all-cause mortality risk as shown here for both men on the top and women on the bottom and for some reason in this study they used the second quartile they defined that as the reference i don't know why they didn't look at relatively lower values in the first quartile as the reference but nonetheless using the second quartile as the reference with somewhat higher mcvs that are a little bit age if you look at the aging related trends on the left so the second quartile in men was 90.59 to 93 for men and 89.2 to 91.6 and when compared with those values people in the fourth quartile that had mcvs of greater than 95.8 for men and greater than 94.2 for women that was associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk now note that these centenarians had mcv's a median mcv of 120. So that would most definitely put them in the fourth quartile and from that we can conclude that their mcv was quote-unquote bad as they had aged and unhealthy levels of mcv all right next up are two mostly liver enzymes as they're found in other tissues but they're found primarily uh in the liver ast aspartate amino transferase and alt alanine amino aminotransferase so let's put these data into perspective by looking at all-cause mortality risk which is shown here for ast on the top and alt on the bottom and this is data from a study of more than 16.6 million people so first looking at the centenary median ast of 21.3 that would put them into q2 which has a similar median value of 21 and when compared with the reference which was defined as a relatively lower asts of 20 or less these centenarian ast would be the lowest all-cause mortality risk so what about alt so when we look at their alt of 10.6 that would put them into q1 that had a median value of 15 but note that for alt relatively higher values somewhere in the 22 range we're associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk so from this we can conclude that these centenarians have an increased all-cause mortality risk based on their alt levels so now we've got one biomarker going in the right direction ast and one going in the wrong direction alt so how can we make sense of that and one way is to look at the ratio between ast to alt which may provide more uh more value more informative value and that's what we can see here we're looking at all-cause mortality with survival rate and percentage on the y-axis plotted against a 10-year up to 10-year follow-up period started from the baseline assessment of ast and alt and what we can see is that for people that had a low ast to alt ratio which which had an average of 1.02 people that had higher ratios which with an average of 1.83 in this study the the higher ast to alt ratio was associated significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk note that the centenarians had a median ast to alt of two so that would put them at a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk based on their ast and a ratio of ast to alt so then in terms of what's bad their ast to alt ratio is bad going in the wrong direction all right next up is homocysteine hcy so let's put that data into perspective in terms of aging so homocysteine levels increase during aging first as shown here homocysteine on the y axis plasma levels uh plotted against age from 40 to 67 years and we can see that homocysteine for both men and women increase during that age range so what about older than 67 as we want to get as close as we can to centenarian data in order to put it into perspective so that's shown here again looking at uh plasma levels of homocysteine on the y axis and now we've got age ranges that go from 65 up to 80 plus and once again when looking at homosystem data for men in the triangles and the women in this in the squares we can see that by the red lines homocysteine levels increase during aging now if we're going to put the centenarian data on this plot it would be somewhere here pretty much off the plot the the highest homocysteine level goes up to 19 they're at 23.1 and even with extrapolation we'd see that they're still way off the off the plot higher levels than expected for their age so from this we can conclude that in terms of what's bad these centenarians have age levels of homocysteine so about all cause mortality risk so here we're looking at a meta-analysis of six studies that included more than 18 000 participants so in terms of risk for all-cause mortality based on homocysteine as low as possible may be optimal as you can see the the risk is pretty close to one as close as you get to zero for homocysteine and then all-cause mortality risk then uh increases as we go to higher levels of homocysteine up to 20 micromolar on this plot but note that the centenarians had even higher than on the plot 23.1 so uh note that this is at least 2.5 fold higher even when looking at a more physiologically relevant as i've yet to see someone who's got homosystem levels as close to zero as possible somewhere in the five range uh is closer to five to 10 is more physiologically relevant nonetheless for a value of 5 for homocysteine these centenarians would have 2.5 fold higher all-cause mortality risk when compared with that lower value so from this we can conclude these these centenarians have aged and unhealthy levels of homocysteine all right so to wrap it all up we've now evaluated data for 16 biomarkers in the high non-centenarian study and we can expand off of part one the group that was the group of biomarkers that were what's good including data for red blood cells and ast but now we have other biomarkers that may be what's bad based on their aging and all-cause mortality data so what's the importance of going over these uh these data for these 16 biomarkers well if we understand the biochemistry and or physiology of aging can we then optimize what's good and minimize what's bad as a strategy for longevity that's the goal alright that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
