# Blood Test #2 in 2022: Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For my first blood test in 2022 we saw that my biological age when using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator phenoage and if you're interested in calculating your own biological age that link will be in the video's description so when using that calculator we saw that my biological age was 32.6 years which was 16.4 years younger than my chronological now prior to 2022 my average reduction for my chronological age minus my biological age over 15 tests was about 12 years so that's a four year further reduction or four year further improvement similarly when using aging.ai we saw that my biological age was 26 years which is 23 years younger than my chronological age and prior to 2022 my 27 test average reduction was 16.4 years so that's a further about seven year reduction for biological age so that's my best data over 35 blood tests since 2015. So what about test number two so the goal for test number two in 2022 was to replicate test number one's diet to see if that's a major factor driving the improvement in biological age so the big question is how well was i able to replicate test number one's diet for test number two so just to refresh everyone's memory for test number two in 2022 i tested about two weeks ago march 14th and we saw that my biological age was 35.4 years which is 13.7 years younger than my chronological now again just to refresh everybody's memory prior to 2022 my average 15 test reduction for biological age was about 12 years so that's still about two years younger than my average uh reduction for biological age similarly for aging.ai my predicted age was 28 years which was 28 21 years younger than my chronological age of 49 and again prior to 2022 over 27 tests my average reduction was 16 years so let's say about a five year further reduction so even though test number two biological age data isn't as good as test number one both of these two tests are better than my previous chronological age minus biological age average improvements since 2015 so then that raises the question am i getting closer to the optimal diet for me now everyone may not use this exact macro micronutrient and food composition uh for themselves i can't say what what the ideal composition will be for others but for me am i getting closer to the optimal diet thereby optimizing multiple blood biomarkers so with that in mind for the the focus of this video will be a full comprehensive diet composition both macro and micronutrients and individual foods for this dietary period when compared with test number one so first let's start with calorie intake as shown there so again we're going to compare test number one's calorie intake versus test number two so on the left we've got the black dots those uh that's the 42 day period that corresponded to test number one and that was december 13th of 2021 through january 23rd of 2022 and for test number two it was a 49 day period from january 24th through march 13th of of 2022. So for test number one my average calorie intake was 23 22 calories per day and for test number two it was 2343 calories per day and besides looking at the averages for for these two dietary periods we can compare these two groups of data using a two-sample t-test and when we do that we see that these two groups of data are not significantly different as the p-value is higher than 0.05 with a p-value of 0.08 so from that we can conclude that there was a similar calorie intake test number two when compared with test number one so what about macronutrients so in terms of macronutrients remember the goal was to replicate test number one's diet composition for test number two and again although i'm going to show averages for test one versus test two this isn't just looking at average data it's comparing the 42-day period that corresponded to test number one versus the 49 day period that corresponded to test number two so first let's start with lipids or fat so we've got blood test number one data on the left and then blood test data for number two on the right so uh just rounding we can see that for test number one my average fat intake was about 84 grams per day and it was 83 grams per day for test number two and when using the two sample t t sorry t test we can see that these two groups of data are not significantly different so what about the individual individual fats so monounsaturated fats just going down the list not different test one versus test two about 16 grams per day total polyunsaturated fats not different about 23 grams per day for both test 1 and test 2. Polyunsaturated fats break down into omega-3 and omega-6 so we can see that my omega-3 was 8 grams versus 8.1 grams not significantly different omega-6 15.4 versus 15.5 not different and in saturated fat identical 24.4 grams per day it for both test number one and test number two so from this we can conclude that there are several similar levels of total fat and individual fats including monounsaturated polyunsaturated uh which include omega-3 and omega-6 and also saturated fatty acids sfa when comparing test number two versus test number one now note that this was not by accident i purposely altered my diet each day to try to match test number one's macronutrients and micronutrients as we'll see in a minute for test number two so knowing what the macronutrient and micronutrients were for task number one every day in chronometer i went and looked at my averages for this dietary period that court that was going to correspond to test number two and if i was low in beta-carotene or low-end fiber i adjusted my intake to try to get as close as possible to the test number one diet composition and based on the fat so far it looks like it did a decent job all right so what about looking at the other macronutrients including protein fiber sugars and net carbohydrates so that's what's shown here again test number one data on the left test number two data on the right so first looking at protein intake 102 grams for test number one 103 grams per day for test number two not different fiber intake about 86 grams for both dietary periods not different so in terms of sugars i track total fructose intake because for me i have a tendency to eat a lot of fruit so uh and in my data total fructose which is defined as fructose plus sucrose divided by two as sucrose is half fructose so i have a tendency to eat a lot of fruit so i don't want to eat too much fruit sugar which is what fructose is because in my data having relatively high levels of fructose is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going the wrong direction than right so when looking at total fructose for test number one versus test number two it was 65 grams per day for test one versus 62 grams per day for test number two and you can see by the p-value those two groups of data are not different and then in terms of net carbs it was 200 about 243 grams per day versus 248 again not different so from this we can see that i had similar levels of protein fiber total fructose and net carbs when comparing test number two data versus test number one in 2022 so to summarize that some i i had similar levels of all macronutrients for the first test when compared with the second test in 2022. All right so what about micronutrients so starting with vitamins again test number one first test number two and again this isn't just showing average data and saying they're different it's comparing the 42-day period that corresponded to test number one versus the 49-day period that corresponded to test number two using two-sample t-tests so instead of going through all of these vitamins and minerals in terms of are they different or not and again we've got test one data on the left test two data on the right uh i'm just gonna show all of these uh that were not different and and that's almost all of the vitamins are not different when comparing uh data for test number one versus test number two with the exception of vitamin c and we can see that for test number two is about a hundred and uh uh well it was about a hundred milligrams higher for for vitamin c and test number two versus test number one and we'll see why in a minute when we look at uh food composition so what about uh for minerals uh actually before going to minerals i should note that uh let's highlight my b12 intake which is about 300 micrograms test one 318 for test two and that's because as i mentioned in my uh late uh my most recent video i supplement with uh method b12 once every three days a thousand micrograms so that's why those are significantly higher than the rda note that i've taken that out for the next blood test so we'll see how that goes but i also supplement with vitamin d in the winter so we can see that my d intake was about 1280 iu's per day and that's because i supplement with a thousand ius of vitamin d per day in the winter as the summer comes up i don't i take it out all right so what about four minerals again test number two uh one data on the left test number two data on the right and again just going through what was not different we can see that almost all of these minerals in terms of average amounts per day were not different when comparing test number one data versus test number two data with the exception of potassium which was 300 milligrams per day higher and i didn't purposefully try to increase my potassium that's likely because of the increased strawberries all right so what about differences for food intake so that's what's shown here uh full diet composition test number two versus test number one so we've got foods on the left and then ranked in order in terms of the foods that i ate in the highest amounts at the top and at the lowest amounts at the bottom and then test number two data on the left test number one data on the right and then whether these two groups of data the 42 day period that corresponded to test number one versus the 49 day period for test number two whether they were significantly different based on a two-sample t-test so i'm just going to highlight what was different again so starting with strawberries we can see that i ate about uh 260-ish more grams or test number two versus test number one and that's because costco ran out of the three berry mix that i usually get it's a mix of strawberries blackberries and blueberries so they ran out so i was i went with strawberries instead so we'll see in a minute that my blueberry and blackberry intake for this dietary period for test number two was zero whereas strawberries it was basically replaced by strawberries so strawberries were the food also that i ate more abundantly than all the foods on the list all right also different but very small differences but statistically significant when comparing test number two versus test number one was watermelon only three grams a day higher though for test number two versus test number one that's so that's basically insignificant similarly small but insignificant increases for pickles four grams per day uh but then almonds i increased them by seven grams per day in part to get close to my daily goal of vitamin e of 20 milligrams per day now note that 15 milligrams is the rda and as i'll present in a future video why i aim for about 20 milligrams per day right now is because having very high vitamin e intakes is correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so for now it seems like 20 milligrams per day uh seems to be good for the biomarker so that's the the value that i've settled on all right then finishing out the remaining foods that i consume for test number one and test number two and comparing them so again looking at differences so brazil nuts were a tenth of a gram less for test number two versus test number one and all although that's significant statistically again that's an insignificant amount and then we can see that peanuts are reduced my intake there from six to about point seven grams per day in test two uh and so i basically replaced almonds for peanuts to get more vitamin e because peanuts don't have as much vitamin e as almonds and then we can see that zero intake of blackberry blackberry and blueberry for test two versus test one which again costco ran out and then note that uh my my diet isn't always perfectly clean if i'm gonna eat junk i do it on the day of the blood test and the day after and then i try to shut it down completely no junk for the remainder of the period until the next blood test so for test number one the junk that i ate uh on those two days was some nutella as highlighted there mixed with peanut butter so homemade reese's peanut butter cups but i also had some pizza as i was traveling on the east coast so i figured it was a good time to get some of the you know world famous east coast pizza so we can see that for test number two pizza but not for test number uh for test number one but not for test number two and we can also see that i didn't have any nutella for that for this blood test the the 49 day period that was in test number two and that's because i replaced it with a different version of a uh homemade reese's peanut butter cup with uh you know milk chocolate bar mixed with m m's and also peanut butter um and when looking at the amounts so that's a 49 day period so we're looking at the amounts of the milk chocolate and m m's that was about 100 grams each over those two days for the day of the blood test and the day after and then i shut it down there were no there was no junk after that for the next 47 days and note that that approach seems to work for me um for me i have to completely eliminate it otherwise i'll be thinking about it every week and i don't want to do that it's not healthy for me so note that when looking at full diet composition my overall diet for test number two was very close to test number one with the exception of the strawberries blackberries and blueberries and almonds for peanuts now to try to keep biological age better than my recent averages with the test number one and test number two data but i'm going to try to stick as close as possible to this diet composition uh going forward so if i can maintain a greater than 14-year biological age reduction just using the venus test as an example that would be better than a 12-year reduction and this diet composition may be one contributing factor as to why i had that uh recent improvement for these two tests so whether that's true we'll see i'm going to try to stick to this composition going forward and we'll see how the biological age results uh how they look all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
