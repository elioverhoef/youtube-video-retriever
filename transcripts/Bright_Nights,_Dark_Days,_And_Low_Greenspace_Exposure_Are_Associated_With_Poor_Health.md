This study that was published in the proceeds of the national academy of sciences titled brighter nights and darker days predict higher mortality risk this was a texas study that looked at 88,000 individuals uk biobank but they were not looking at satellite data they were actually wearing a device that was measuring light at all hours of the day uh this is about 88,000 89,000 they followed them for eight years this is amazing what they found so they looked at model one and uh let me see here yeah model one where they looked at the time of day here on the xaxis so 16 that's about 4:00 in the afternoon to 4:00 in the afternoon and they asked this question compared to people who get 50th percentile of light exposure and less what would happen to mortality for people that were in the 50th to 70th percentile that's here in blue at the bottom people in the 70th to 90th percentile that's in purple here in the middle and people who got the highest amounts of light 90th to 100 percentile and that's here in red notice first of all what happens as we go from 50th to 70th 70th to 90th and 90th to 100 do you notice what happens the amplitude of this effect gets bigger and bigger what does that suggest dose response curve again it implies causation in the uh bradford hill criteria okay what else do you notice notice that sunlight at all hours of the day reduces mortality except for from about midnight to about 7:00 in the morning so having bright light from midnight to about 7:00 in the morning is not a good thing in fact this thing stops to become beneficial at around 9:00 at night and you can see that works in all cause mortality cardiometabolic activity and other cause mortality same sort of situation we're seeing that light during the day is beneficial light at night is not beneficial okay and this was the uh findings they said these findings demon at the importance of maintaining a dark environment across late night and early morning hours when the central circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to light and seeking bright light during the day to enhance circadian rhythms protection of lighting environments may be especially important in those at risk for both circadian disruption and mortality such as in intensive care units or aged care settings across the general population avoiding night light and seeking daylight may lead to a red ction and disease burden especially cardi metabolic diseases and may increase longevity michael this is exactly the same diseases that we're talking about at the beginning when we're talking about the mitochondrian we're actually connecting these dots let's connect it even more we said that trees and grass and leaves highly reflective of infrared light what do we see when people go out into these spaces we have known for decades that people who live in green spaces have better outcomes notice this this 28% reduction in diabetes typee 2 16% reduction in cardiovascular mortality 31% reduction in total mortality and uh you know people say well look hey these people who live in green spaces they have more money they have more status they can extracise more this is the reason why they have better mortality well i got a i got a um i got a a study for you south louisville kentucky 4 square mile area they measured crp levels which is a surrogate for cardiovascular disease and then they went and planted 8,000 trees mature trees with leaves already on them that's all they did they just planted trees now according to what we've talked about today that would improve and increase infrared light especially when you go outside that should have beneficial effects just by itself without exercising obviously we didn't inject money into their bank accounts we didn't do anything else we just planted the trees and then 2 to three years later we measured crp levels again there was a mind-blowing reduction of crp in that in the same population by 133% that may not sound like a lot but that's about the equivalent that you would get with uh exercise regular exercise three times a week so that's mind-blowing what did this study of metaanalysis of everybody who gets outside into green spaces find well let me tell you what they found they said that we found that spending time in or living close to natural green spaces is associated with diverse and significant health benefits it reduces the risk of now listen to these diseases see see if they sound familiar type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease premature death pre-term birth and increases sleep duration people living closer to nature also had reduced diastolic blood pressure heart rate and stress in fact one of the really interesting things that we found is that exposure to green space significantly reduces people's levels of salivary cortisol a physiological marker of stress
