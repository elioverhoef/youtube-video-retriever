Torine impacts many hallmarks of aging and that's what we'll see here torine inhibits cell inessence tiir shortening mitochondri dysfunction and has a positive impact on many other hallmarks of aging but note that these are molecular organel and cellular alterations so an example of a molecular alteration would be epigenetic changes an example of an alteration at the organella level would be mitochondrial dysfunction and at the cellular level obviously stem cells but from the big picture is torine related to health so torine deficiency associates with poor health including high glucose and correspondingly diabetes hypertension or high blood pressure liver disease and many obesity related measures now the good news is that toine levels can be tracked and potentially optimized and to do that i've been using adome metabolomics using io's kit which includes toine levels but also 600 other metabolites if you want to track your own levels of torine and many other metabolites discount link in the video's description so what's my data that's what we'll see here we've got plasma levels of torine on the y ais plotted against time on the x in 2023 over five tests average torine levels were 113 millar which is equivalent to 113 micromolar and we'll see why that conversion from millar to micromolar is important in a second all right so those data in 2023 then raise the question what's optimal for torine levels so i think at top the list is avoiding torin's age related decline and that's what we'll see here with serum levels of touring on the y- axis plotted against age on the x and this is from birth to around 60 years old and then we can see that touring levels do indeed decline during aging so have i avoided torin's age related decline at least from 2023 into 2024 so in 2024 i currently have data for five tests and over those five tests there average average touring levels is 118 micromolar so at least for avoiding this the age related decline over this relatively short period of 14 months so far so good so we give that a check mark but note that this is a relatively short period the goal isn't just to optimize touring for you know 14-month period it's to optimize touring levels and keep them relatively high indefinitely so stay tuned for that in upcoming videos over the many years coming in the future all right so another way to look at these data is by comp comparing 113 2023 data and 118 micromolar 2024 data with what's expected b based on chronological age and when doing that analysis we can see that based on chronological age somewhere around an average of 75 micromolar for torine levels would be expected based on my current chronological age of 51 years in contrast 113 to 118 micromolar 2023 to 2024 data would be what would what would be expected or higher than expected based on chronological age it could be the average value found someone for someone that's around 20 years younger but note that i could go higher uh values in newborns are somewhere around 220 micromolar so should i go as high as 220 micromolar so i prefer to focus on postmaturity levels of biomarkers in terms of what's found in youth so with that in mind i can indeed go a bit higher we can see that values in 20-year-olds average values for tour touring are somewhere around 130 40 micromolar so that's the plan so how can i get there and i think most people in this space are using supplements torine supplements uh to try to optimize circulating levels of toine so should i supplement to resist age related changes now supplementation is a part of the approach but i try to save that for when diet fails when i can't make dietary changes to optimize a given biomarker and in that case i would then supplement so with that in mind are there are there any foods or nutrients that are significantly correlated with toine and then i can optimize diet with the goal of optimizing torine so how can i do that what's the approach and for those who are regular viewers on the channel i want to say thanks and i appreciate you uh this will will be a review and and it will be it will be a review for you but it will be new for people who may not be familiar with how i'm able to look at correlations for diet supplements and other metrics with biomarkers so since 2015 i've weighed all of my food using a food scale and then i enter those daily food amounts into chronometer which is a diet tracking app and and if you want to track your own diet using chronometer discount link in the video's description and then i take the chronometer data and i export that into a spreadsheet so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests the average dietary intake for those 50 days then lines up with the latter blood test so now each blood test has an average dietary intake and when enough data for both diet and blood test i can calculate correlations for diet or any other metric that i'm tracking with biomarkers so with that in mind for this following this test test number 10 for torine i looked at 91 comparisons for torine with foods macro and micronutrients and of that list only one only one nutrient zinc was significantly correlated with plasma levels of torine which is what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got plasma levels of torine plotted against the average daily zinc intake in milligrams per day and then we can see that the correlation cor correlation coefficient was 0.69 very close to a strong correlation anything greater than 0.7 is considered a quote unquote strong correlation and we can see that the p value is below the threshold of significance less than 0.05 now as a quick aside when you've got 91 comparisons this could be a false positive discovery but i'll address that uh in a minute i i try not to throw out data uh but i'll i'll address why i'm not using that approach uh in detail in a minute so based on this correlation i if if the goal is to keep toring level high i should keep daily zinc intake my average daily z zinc intake greater to greater than 14.5 mig per day but sometimes i don't follow the correlations in order to test their strength to to test if they're causitive or not so following test number 10 my average zinc intake for test number 11 was 13.2 mg per day now based on the correlation that you see here it if this correlation is real we should expect to see an average touring level that corresponds to 13.2 mig per day of zinc of around 75 micromolar for torine now if zinc is causitive in helping to keep torine levels high this correlation will either stay relatively high around 69 or it will get even stronger moving closer to 1.0 so in in this case as i mentioned for that 13.2 milligram of zinc per day if i see 75 micromol for torine that's on the correlation curve and it's following the data however if zinc is not positive and that 13.2 mig per day of zinc leads to something like 150 micromolar for torine that would not be what the correlation predicts the correlation subsequently following test number 11 or 12 or whenever that data would be generated would weaken it wouldn't be 69 it would be some value lower and its p value would rate would go higher so probably higher than 0.05 so rather than using the false discovery rate approach in general sometimes i do include it if i'm trying to prove a point but that's a rare uh occurrence this is the approach that i use i try to follow correlations and then after each iteration following a blood test the correlations either strengthen or weaken and i continue to follow the correlations that are at top the list in ter in terms of their strongest correlation with a given biomarker now in terms of whether this worked test number 11 results came in earlier this week it took a while for the results to come in like six weeks uh but it is what it is it's out of my hands so those results and diet correlations with touring plasma levels of toring whether or zinc is still significantly correlated with torine are currently on patreon in the correlations tier so if you're interested in that check it out i also sent blood for test number 12 on september 6 so about a week ago so those results should be coming in sometime in october and expect an update video on the keeping touring levels relatively high and avoiding an age related decline in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself while also helping to support the channel including atome metabolomics ulta lab test which is where i get the majority of my tests including the standard chem panel cbc hscrp all of that good stuff epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home blood testing with with sciox health which includes apob b but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also o got merch so if you're interested in
