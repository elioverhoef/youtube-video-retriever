Blood testing for blood urea nitrogen what's optimal so the blood urea nitrogen test quantifies levels of urea the metabolite that makes uh urine yellow that are in your blood so how do levels of blood urea nitrogen or bun uh change during aging so that's what we're looking at here in a study of about 378 000 subjects we can see that lower levels of blood urea nitrogen are found in youth with values of around 11 milligrams per deciliter in women and 13 milligrams per deciliter in men that are around 20 years old and slowly during aging those values uh increase such that a 90 year old subject would have blood urine nitrogen values in the range of 20 to 23 uh average values uh 20 to 23 milligrams per deciliter so then what's the association between uh for all for blood urination with all-cause mortality risk can bond levels be altered through diet and then what's my data so uh first uh blood urine nitrogen levels less than 15 milligrams per deciliter are associated with maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk or acm for short so we're looking here at the risk for all cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against the blood urea nitrogen concentration in blood and this is a study of around 31 000 subjects so the reference range for bun is 7 to 20 milligrams per deciliter and that's highlighted by the dashed lines and what we can see is compared to a bun of 15 even though 20 is at the high end of the reference range someone that has a 20 bullet urea nitrogen level has about a 40 increased risk for all-cause mortality when compared with 15. So the lowest risk for all-cause mortality based on this plot is for bond levels that are 15 or less so when considering the aging data and the blood urea the all-cause mortality mortality date it would seem that values less than 15 not 7 to 20 that are on the reference range may be optimal for health so can be can bond be optimized through diet how is it malleable can it even even be altered so what we're looking at here is a plot of nitrogen intake against urea production and what we can see is that the higher the nitrogen intake or dietary nitrogen intake the higher amounts of urea that are produced and this correlation is almost perfectly linear with a correlation of 0.98 a perfectly linear correlation as good as it gets is 1.00 so uh where does dietary nitrogen come from well it comes exclusively from almost exclusively from amino acids which are the building blocks building blocks of protein so if you eat a lot of protein you'll have a high content of dietary nitrogen which should increase your urea production and correspondingly you should have higher levels of blood urea nitrogen now this assumes normal kidney function so if your kidney function is normal and not declining during age a higher protein intake should lead to a higher blood urea nitrogen level and just to illustrate that it's just uh almost exclusively amino acids essentially from proteins that you're getting dietary nitrogen here we're looking at the essential features of fatty acid and you can see that there are no ends no nitrogen in its chemical structure and similarly for sugars including glucose galactose and fructose you don't see any ends for nitrogen in their chemical structure either so the higher your dietary protein intake including amino acids uh the higher your urea production and potentially your blood urea nitrogen so is that true what's my data so uh for those who don't know i blood test four to six times per year and then i track my diet every day including weighing all my food and then i uh log how much of each food into a an app and then that tells me my macro and micronutrient content and then i log all that into an excel file so then for each blood test i can correlate the average dietary intake during that period to look for correlations between my diet with my blood test results so what i'm showing here are blood test data for the last five years 25 different blood tests each blue dot corresponds to a different uh blood test result over the past five years and i've plotted blood urea nitrogen levels on the y axis against my daily average protein intake and what we can see is uh as indicated by the red dotted trend line is that the higher my protein intake goes the higher my blood urea nitrogen levels are and this correlation is strong with a of 0.78 the r squared or the percentage of the variability in blood urine nitrogen that can be explained by protein intake my protein intake is pretty solid it's 60 percent that's a large percentage of bond that can be explained by my protein intake and this is a significant correlation as indicated by the p value so when considering that lower levels of bond are found in youth and that greater than 15 is associated with an increased all-cost mortality risk i monitor my protein intake to make sure that my bun is less than 15 milligrams per deciliter all right that's all i've got for now uh for more uh you can find me lots of places online have a great day
