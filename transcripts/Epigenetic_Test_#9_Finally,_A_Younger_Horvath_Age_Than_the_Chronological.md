# Epigenetic Test #9: Finally, A Younger Horvath Age Than the Chronological

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age is the horvat test and that's what we can see here on the y- axis we've got dna m ag or dna methylation age otherwise known as epigenetic age and this is using the horvath test on the x-axis we've got chronological age going from birth through 100 years and note that there are a lot of different colored circles on this plot this is a multicell and tissue clock in terms of the correlation we can see that the horvath clock has a correlation coefficient of 0.94 for its ability to predict chronological age now for a perfectly linear positive correlation a correlation coefficient of 1.0 would be perfectly linear so that this correlation is 0.94 indicates that the horvath test is strongly correlated with chronological age so with that in mind what's my data so around a year ago at this time we saw that my horvath epigenetic age also known as intrinsic age was 56.3 years which was 7 years older than my chronological age at that time absolutely terrible for someone who's trying to live possibly you know 123 years if i can i don't think i'll get there with data like this so blood test results from the october 9th 2023 test just came in so year-over-year results so how am i doing have i improved or is this worse and for this test we can see that it was 49.4 years which is a 7year reduction for horvath's ep genetic age year over-year so this is where i could probably do a little dance and a little celebration but the fact is while this is technically true it's not an accurate represent representation of the full picture so for that how does 2023 data compare against 2022 as i have nine tests over that period which is what we'll see here data for 2022 on the left for 2023 on the right on the y-axis we've got intrinsic age again horvat's epigenetic age and these data are are generated by true diagnostic if you want to measure your own horvath epigenetic age there'll be a discount link in the video's description so in 2022 over three tests my average horvath epigenetic age was 55 years again pretty terrible about 5 years older than my chronological age thus far in 2023 the average horvath epigenetic age is 52.8 years which is a 22-year reduction for this test uh comparing 2023 versus 2022 so clearly not a 7-year reduction when putting it into context it's on the right track but definitely not uh as exaggerated as a 7-year reduction so in order to make further gains and progress towards further reducing this which factors are significally correlated at this time after nine test with with horvat epigenetic age with the goal obviously of repeating a 49.4 measurement as i did for this test potentially going even lower and getting even better so to address that first let's take a look at correlations for macro and micronutrients with horvath's epigenetic age and to assess that i looked at 42 variables again macro and micronutrients and in terms of what was significant here we can see that only two met a p value threshold of less than or equal to 0.05 now note that for an earlier for an earlier iteration of this video body weight was significant correlated with horvat's epigenetic age which is now just outside of significance with a p value of 0.06 so in terms of the most significant or uh this was copper uh the mineral copper in this case with a significant positive correlation in other words a relatively higher copper intake in my data is significantly correlated with an older epigenetic age using the horvath test now i get the majority of my copper intake from two sources cacao beans and mushrooms mushrooms weren't significantly correlated with horvath's epigenetic age but cacao beans were in the same direction and relatively close to significance with a p value of0 0.07 in uh conversely vitamin b12 is inversely significantly inversely correlated with horvath's epigenetic age so a relatively higher b12 intake is significally correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age now i don't know which if any of these variables actually impact horvath's epigenetic age so the goal is to follow every significant correlation so what does that mean in practice so to keep copper and caca intake towards the low end of my intake range that would be following the correlation so for example for copper i've my intake range over those nine tests is 3.9 to 5 milligrams per day and for cacao beans it's 2.4 to 9.8 gam per day now to follow the correlation since it's a positive correlation eating towards the low end of my range would be following the correlation with the goal of if it is causation which i don't know uh reducing horvath epen genetic age now how am i doing for that through november 17th and this is from october 9th so starting from when the last test happened through uh just a couple days ago or yesterday my average intake for copper and cacao intake are 3.7 milligram and 1.9 gram per day and that's an average daily intake as i weigh all my food and record it uh using chronometer so in terms of following the correlations we can see that 3.7 is less than 3.9 and 1.9 is less than 2.4 so i'm currently on the low side of my range following that correlation or following those correlations even though kaban is just outside of significance and for vitamin b12 that's relatively simple just keep it in the approach as i included that prior to the last test with the goal of reducing homosysteine so maybe it was able to reduce horvat's epigenetic h2 again there's no way to know if it's causation or not all right so what about foods which foods are significantly correlated with horvat's epigenetic age so to assess that i looked at correlations for 41 foods that i've consumed commonly consumed over this over these nine tests and in terms of what significant only three met that threshold of being less than 0.05 for the p value and each were significantly inversely correlated so meaning relatively higher intakes was significantly correlated with a younger horath epigenetic age so what what does that mean in practice how should i follow how can i follow the correlations for salt intake my range during these nine test is 1732 to 1770 mg per per day when considering it's an inverse correlation a relatively higher intake may be related to a younger horvath epigenetic age so to follow the correlation i should be towards the high end of my range and thus far since the last test october 9th i'm averaging 1772 1772 milligrams of sodium per day so i'm following that correlation as that's towards the high end of my range for turmeric my intake range over the these nine tests has been 1.8 to 2.3 g per day to follow the correlation i should be towards the high end of my range current average daily intake is 2.5 gram per 2.5 gram of turmeric per day so that too is following the correlation and then last but not least beats intake my range over these nine tests using the horvath test 196 to 219 gram per day and i'm currently at 219 g per day so that too is at the high end of my range following the cor so then the big question is after these five foods or nutrients following the correlations following the data will it work and i'm going to retest or test number seven in 2023 is scheduled for november 27th so about a week from now so that data should be available sometime late december early january so stay tuned for that in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic and tmia testing ned quantification at home metabolomics oral microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health including apob green tea die tracking with chronome or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch just like the shirt i'm wearing here so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in
