# Metabolite Ratios As An Index Of Oxidative Stress

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Oxidative stress is a hallmark of aging more specifically it's found within the mitochondrial dysfunction hallmark so with that in mind how can we quantify oxidative stress most commonly it's measured by quantifying oxidative damage to nucleic acids including dna and rna but also oxidative damage to lipids and proteins but metabolite ratios can also provide information about oxidative stress with the most popular being the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio so in the presence of oxidative stress in this case hydrogen hydrogen peroxide h2o2 glutathione in its reduced state gsh more specifically the thiagroup sh becomes oxidized such that the two molecules of reduced glutathione become one molecule of oxidized glutathione gssg so each sulfur forms a disulfide bridge so the two molecules become one to reduce become one oxidized for glutathione so with that in mind a high gssg to gss gsh ratio is indicative of relatively high levels of h2o2 or oxidative stress now unfortunately gsh and gssg individually are not yet available commercially available in the united states we can measure total levels of glutathione but that doesn't tell us about the ratio between reduced and oxidized but the good news is the oxidized to reduce glutathione ratio isn't the only way to evaluate oxidative stress spat especially when using metabolite ratios so in this video i'm going to go over two examples cystine to cysteine and methionine sulfoxide to methionine so first cystein to cysteine is similar to the gssg to gsh ratio so starting with two molecules of cysteine the amino acid cysteine we can see that this amino acid also has sulfhydro groups sh and in the presence of oxidative stress those self-hydrogroups become oxidized such that the two cysteine molecules become one cystine and you can see that the sulfhydryl groups the individual self-hydro groups have now become oxidized forming a disulfide bridge so again the two molecules of cysteine get converted into one the oxidized molecule cystine and this is very similar to what glutathione looks like in its reduced and oxidized state now as a side note note that the cystine the oxidized version can be reduced back into cysteine but that's a topic for another video so when considering the cystine to cysteine ratio that would be a relatively high amount of cystine relative to cysteine would be indicative of relatively high oxidative stress so what's optimal in a paper that was just recently published last month and that paper and all the other papers in this video be in the video's description we can see that the cystine to cysteine ratio increases during aging and we can see that by looking at the age beta coefficient or age beta is positive which which shows that with increasing age there's an increase in the oxidized to reduce ratio for cystine to cysteine and this is a significant association as you can see the p-value and false discovery rate fdr are both below 0.05 so in terms of what's optimal for this ratio cystine divided by cysteine the goal should be or i think the goal should be to avoid an age-related increase now note that also associated with age in this paper was the chin uranine to trip the fan ratio and if you're familiar with the channel that ratio may be familiar because i did a video on a video on it as it's in the day novo nad synthesis pathway so with that in mind what's my data so in april of 2023 i sent blood for at-home metabolomics and again if you're familiar with the channel the iolo kit may look familiar because i've made videos looking at kindlearning and tryptophan again as a part of the day novel nad synthesis pathway but also it includes measurements of taurine polyamines too which both taurine and poly means extend lifespan and in addition to these few metabolites the iolo kit contains data from more than 500 metabolites so i've got a whole bunch of videos in mind in terms of their metabolites and how we can use that to potentially slow aging for various organ systems so if you're interested in using this kit there'll be a discount link in the video's description all right so to answer the question for what's my data we can see that for cystine relatively low 0.05 micro molar which is equivalent to 50 nanomolar this is relatively low and then when considering my how much cysteine that i have in my blood 9.5 approximately 9.5 micromolar we can see get my ratio for cystine to cysteine is relatively low at 0.06 and again in terms of what's optimal the goal in future tests is to avoid an age-related increase so stay tuned for future videos and we can see how well i'm doing or not to minimize an age-related increase for this ratio all right next up is the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio and the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio can also be used as an index of oxidative stress and that's what we can see here so starting with the amino acid methionine it too has a sulfur atom which can then be oxidized more specifically in the case of h2o2 or hydrogen peroxide such that its sulfur atom then becomes oxidized and you can see that it has an s double bond oh that's oxidized sulfur thereby forming methionine sulfoxide and again as a side note this is a reversible reaction where methionine sulfoxide can be reduced with an enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase back into methionine but again that's a story for another day so in terms of what's optimal for this ratio in a paper that was published in 2022 although they didn't compare the ratio between methionine sulfoxide and methionine individually methionine sulfoxide was shown to be higher in centenarians or people were close to centenarian status their average age was 97 years when compared with their offspring and spouses of the offspring that had an average age of 67 years so in other words there was an age-related increase for methionine sulfoxide as a part of this index of oxidative stress and when considering that oxidative stress increases during aging just like cysteine divided by cysteine avoiding the age-related increase or avoiding an age-related increase for methionine sulfoxide divided by methionine is atop the list so what's my data we can't we can't avoid an age-related increase if we don't know what our data is so what's my data so consider this this is baseline data i can't make any definitive conclusions from it because i wasn't able to find any published data for the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio and how it changes during aging but when looking at my data we can see that my methionine sulfoxide levels are 0.79 micromolar relative to cystine another oxidized molecule this is relatively higher so the goal for me is to reduce my levels of methionine sulfoxide and when divided by methionine i get a ratio of 0.05 so again this is my baseline and stay tuned for future videos using iolo's kit to see how well i'm able to reduce my levels of oxidative stress by looking at metabolite ratios all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing as mentioned in this video or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyfox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
