# Lifespan Extension In Drosophila: A Conversation with Dr. Michael Rose (full, unedited video)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

[music] i want to jump right in and uh i think i think a lot a lot more people in the aging space know about you uh you know man it wasn't like that 10 years ago which is crazy i'm you know i knew about you but most people didn't still so uh i think it's important that we uh start from uh your lab being one of the few if the only that's extended lifespan without using drugs or you know any pharmaceuticals you can think of or calorie restriction uh so i think i think a good place to start would be the experimental evolution approach explaining that and then going into the magnitude of the lifespan extension that you saw as a result well thank you for this opportunity mike uh and it's it's great to be interacting with you like this um i've been admired your stuff for some time so in 1977 at the university of sussex library i was reading an article by a uh a very early uh gerontology person called watteau a belgian who actually had worked in the lab of theodosius bajansky but watia was a neolimarkian and he was looking for neolamarkin effects on lifespan and he did a experiment where he bred flies exclusively from older adults he did this in two different drosophila species sub obscure and pseudo obscura and in both cases he got an increase in life span which he interpreted in terms of a lansing effect or an inverse lansing effect because when lansing did it fly his staff he died out for completely different reasons um i read the article and i thought oh he modified the first stage of reproduction which according to hamilton's forces of natural selection means that given enough time these populations should evolve delayed aging and which which was not watio's interpretation of his own experiment whatsoever so i thought well why don't i do a cleaner version of this experiment using nicely of red fruit flies which i did during my doctorate at sussex in the 1970s and it worked just as well for me in my one population pilot experiment as it had for water and i wrote up that experiment a few others that i've been doing during my doctorate i sent them off to an obscure journal called nature which uh published the article in 1980 it's called a test of evolutionary theories of senescence and i was so enamored with this very simple experimental evolution project where you just change the early stage at which you allow one organism to reproduce and then you take advantage of evolutionary genetic theory the most hardcore theory in our biology um and it does the work for you only uh the second time we did the experiment started in 1980 i did it with five populations uh with the late reproduction and fire control populations and off we went uh starting in february of 1980 and those populations still exist they i sold them to an anti-aging company um called themselves flies which still owns them [music] and i still work with them intermittently as a consultant to to various companies that are interested in working with those um since then in my lab uh university of uh california and irvine we have taken lifespan up using experimental pollution and taking it down using experimental machinery back up again um [music] uh we've also modified lifespan using diet using drugs as have other people um so i have been manipulating aging since 1977 as well as studying this underlying genetics genomics and transcriptomics in partnership with many other people um ever since the 1970s and all of the work suggests that um aging is not uh an uncontrollable process of molecular damage it is instead the tuning of adaptation of the two age which is easily done by natural selection utd uh through its dereliction of doing that job engenders aging and uh the genomic means by which natural selection tunes aging involves hundreds of sites in the gm not one not two not seven hundreds as i said in dozens of interviews over the last decade and that in turn tunes hundreds of transcript levels both qualitatively and quantitatively and it in turn tunes hundreds of metabolites of all different kinds and then it retunes all the organ systems and the flies the hard thing is to find something that is not connected to aging uh almost everything is connected to ancient even a very simple organism like a fruit fly and i would say very confidently by the extrapolation i think you use also so so you started from the same founder group of flies and then you separated them into the long live versus a short short live or yeah isn't is that's basically the well the the the material protocol is to tune the life cycle if you tune the life cycle so that there's a long period of time between when an egg becomes or is given a delt that is produced by the egg is given the opportunity to produce the longer that life cycle is the greater the lifespan that that population will evolve and it does so at considerable speed and then if you then reverse the procedure and take long life cycles wise and giving shorter life cycles they will rapidly evolve shorter life spans um and so going up going down going up going down that's something i've now been doing for 44 years yeah so that so that approach is clearly showing that you can use evolution to extend lifespan and not extend it by a little bit by 10 or 15 or 20 you know by by two times three times five times yeah so the question is how many generations did it take before you saw um say a doubling of lifespan in uh drosophila doubling of lifespan took about 80 generations 80 generations so 25 years if we're going to extrapolate that into human years right 25 years per generation so we're looking at uh what 2000 years 80 times 25 right so so uh together with my very good colleague larry muller we published a paper in around 1990 somewhere between 89 and 91 about 30 years ago on how long it would take if you wanted to use this approach with human lifespan and it's not worth doing so actually since 84 at the instigation at first to journalists and then by more and more people that i've met over the last uh 37 years i've been working coming up with faster and faster ways of doing this that don't involve experimental evolution so okay can you can you tell us more about that or is that uh sure so so we published an article in um well what was it uh the early two let me try to get the year circa 2010 um in a book called the future of aging uh he was edited by greg faye and steve cools and a couple of other people where um we outlined uh one idea that a company called geneseo was founded on and that company still exists [music] and [music] that was basically a layered supplementation uh very michaelis garden i might say uh except instead of experimenting on mike westgarden himself the idea was to experiment with fruit flies and see what we could get to work there and uh look at the omics of how it was done in fruit flies and then use an omic bridge to to humans because so much of our genomes are transcriptomes and the timelines overlap um so would have been an omic uh guided uh bridging to human intervention so that was a technology i was very enamored with 15 years ago when that company was founded um then i found another company with a man called larry cabral about six years ago it's called lyceum and that was based on another strategy and i don't know if the company is mostly c student business but the website might still be up and uh so i've gone through a whole succession of technological ideas for how to intervene in the human aging process that do not involve experimental evolution and i'm still interested in that project so wouldn't so uh i guess the idea would be to come up with a cocktail of as many different or you know supplements drugs etc as possible to kind of replicate the uh omic multi-omic uh signature that you see in the extended lifespan dramatically extended lifespan in the food flies but i'm guessing that that's going to fall short because i mean you're you know as you mentioned you're dealing with hundreds of genes and then hundreds of trans transcriptomic sites and then you know maybe more than that in terms of metabolites so how close were you able to get using the multi uh multi-supplement you know drug based approach in terms of extending lifespan in flies um so janessa made a good start in that project and that research actually led to a supplement which is available right now um it's marketed by a company called chennaire uh [music] g-e-n-a-i-r-e and [music] i can't remember the name of the product but you can look up the company name on amazon i was not directly involved in developing that product or testing it but it used some of my ideas um [music] uh and and i guess i think they call it rebuilder or something like that um and uh right now it's being marketed as a cognitive health product since i left gymnastics in 2010 um [music] over the last 11 years i've been very interested in using ai more precisely machine learning to uh master the intricacies of going from fruit fly genomes to human genomes of going from ohmic effects to clinical efficacy in humans we are now engaged in a series of publications which started in [music] 2017 with a massive genomics paper and then in 2018 we published our ai methodology which is called plan flam well we didn't develop the machine learning tool in that article first author is is more n-e-l-r ld more than last author that presents some of the machine learning we use then in 2019 we publish a transcriptomics paper we are working on metabolomic stuff um i haven't seen the manuscript yet um so uh you know in parallel with my aging career uh i've just generally worked on [music] quantitative genetics of adaptation um and and aging is just in a sense an aspect of adaptation um and you know right from my earliest work on this stuff in the late 70s it was quite apparent that the genetic foundations of adaptation and aging complex so one of the things i've worked on very hard over the last 41 years is strategies for unpacking the complexity and making our way through complexity both from the standpoint of scientific inference and from the standpoint of technological intervention um so uh as some of your listeners or viewers may already know i did a website called 55 theses t-h-e-s-e-s um model after martin luther 95 theses uh but shorter uh enter here um where i try to outline the insights that i had as of 10 years ago but over the last 10 years we've made a lot of additional progress um which we're trying to publish i mean we are publishing it in this sort sequence of papers that started in 2017. You can find them on my google scholar page michael rvo's and most of our publications since uh 2017 are in spain and there'll be more to come over the next three years um we have one um under review under endless revision of the journal i will not know to protect the guilty um so i think by 2023 um people interested in genomics people interested in adaptation people interested in aging should all have a pretty clear understanding of how complicated the core omics foundations of all this stuff are and also how machine learning can sort through all these things and um thus potentially furthermore how we can bounce back around going from you know fruit flies to humans humans back to fruit flies and make all the connections thanks to homology because it turns out that the metazoan tool kit for adaptation for aging has huge overlaps um you're not when you do experiments with crossover or for that amount of humans you're not just studying drosophila oil humans you're studying basic features of aging adaptation and genomics that are in common between medicine the majority of the time the clear majority of the time and you know we're going to be making that quite clear first with christopher then we'll be doing some projects with humanoid data and some machine learning tools um so the 55 thesis uh your website is a great segue coming going from the machine learning approach into actionable ways to extend human lifespan now right but then once the machine learning uh approach has characterized the omics of uh you know uh extreme longevity at least in drosophila and the challenge is gonna be uh and even even if slash when that's done in humans within the next few years the challenge is going to be uh how do you positively impact that impact that with the goal of getting significant increases in lifespan and unfortunately in the reductionist science era that we live in most studies are going to be one supplement at a time and if you propose multi-ingredient formulations probably it'll get that or rejected in review so there what do you think about the technical hurdles in terms of going from characterizing the phenotype of comprehensive characterization of the phenotype of aging into now using the similar machine learning approach to uh get dramatic increases in in uh health and lifespan okay so there's an intermediate step that i think is available this decade um [music] you can use all the same tools um in order to properly characterize what supplements or pharmaceuticals are doing and as you know full well the only real difference between a supplement in the pharmaceutical is its legal status right so uh basically any given supplement of pharmaceutical is going to have effects that are as complicated as the effects of experimental evolution um and evidence to that effect has been accumulating over the last 20 years since we got good genomic and then transfer generic tools um [music] there is no simplicity to be found even if you are doing one substance in your interventions um all through the 20th century [music] you know biology was the science of emathobic except for my fields which are evolutionary quantitative genetics which is where those of us who like math that's how we do our biology we do it with math and serious math not trivial um well it turns out that in the 20th century this kind of uh kindergarten for biology where biologists got away with doing the simplest experiments that can give you interpretable results which are great you know for genetic diseases um when you do have one or a few major pathways that are colossally screwed up but as soon as you step away from that to most people's chronic aging associated disorders that's aging itself you're dealing with a whole world of painful complexity which only people with my background really enjoy um unfortunately genomics arrived at the end of the 20th century start of the 21st century and qualitatively blew up the game for the reductionists who wanted to study anything more complicated than genetic diseases or you know the consequences of simple pathogens like viruses um so even though the reductionists are low to admit it and even though they dominate nih in large waves of nsf they're dead they're just scientifically in technology they're dead in the water they're floating face down you know like william holden started sensitive [music] it's over for them and you know like the uh heliocentric um talmaic astronomers um in the 17th century the century of galileo and newton they are not accepting their obsolescence with any great grace magnanimity or care for the welfare of their fellow human they're fighting tooth and nail against the destruction of productionism but reductionism is being destroyed with every good genomic transcriptomic and metabolic publication because they all show complexity and the beauty of it is the people like myself alex trevorenkov a whole bunch of other people are just you know we're not hanging around the funeral the reduction is moving on and we're using machine learning tools to try to parse that complexity and find ways forward um [music] and that that's where the action is going to be um so even with the machine learning based approach and i'm 100 on board i've been thinking about that for the longest time too so even with the machine learning based approach let's say you've got a big study of thousands of hundreds of thousands or more people and you use machine learning ai based approach to come up with a set of parameters that could potentially extend health and lifespan in that cohort at the end of the day though for the average person they still would have to use the machine learning based approach using some computational tools to predict if that if this you know what worked in that big study would work for them based on their genetics their environment et cetera so so now there are two layers involved it's machine learning at the big you know the macros the macro and then down to the individual because if the individual is just gonna hey it worked in that study that's what it they came up with and they're just gonna take it based on faith it could do more harm than good right so okay okay so i have two i think important but straightforward things to say about that the first thing is people do this kind of machine learning interaction every day when you use google search you are using a very carefully constructed set of machine learning tools that deal with vast amounts of complexity and in less than a second in order to address the individual concerns of individual people okay so people whether they realize it or not are interfacing with gigantic databases and very powerful machine learning tools when you you know looking to buy an item on amazon you're doing the same stuff okay so whether people look under the hood or not your lives are totally entangled with machine learning tools so all we're doing is is extending them into the realm of biology even though the vast majority of professional biologists about their phds before 2000 hate it i mean they're not neutral about it they hate it because it's just not how they were trained in how biology should be done because you know frankly they were never evolutionary geneticists or quantitative to begin with whereas a lot of the tools that um genomicists use are back-end uh quantitative genetics tools so the g-wise is a kind of quantitative genetics type of analytic so the first thing is you know the future is of technologies including biological technologies will be dominated by machine learning that's just a fact and people who can't accept it can't really be that effective in the 21st century the second thing i would say is i'm not really fond of the idea of people sitting at home with their laptop googling a supplement and saying well gee how much of this random supplement that somebody published in japan based on the study of uh using the supplement on 12 inbred mice uh compared to you know eight inbred mice 12 on the supplement eight not on a supplement and the 12 on the supplement lived you know three months longer i'm not fond of that kind of uh biomedical intervention i have any number of friends and acquaintances who do that routinely um a number of them have died because i've known these people for more than 30 years um [music] i have never seen any really obvious substantial benefits according to them what the i was saying was the big the big uh you know even though machine learning is definitely going to identify uh supplements you know that can extend life lifespan in big cohorts and i get the idea that machine learning is ubiquitous in our lives it's everywhere now but if i wanna if i wanna you know if i have my own blood test data and i wanna use a machine learning approach to identify the best panel of supplement that will extend my health and vigor and all those things it doesn't exist yet i don't know when it will exist i can only hope that it will exist sometime in the near future but okay okay so i have a confession to make so on the order of 10 years ago i proposed to the company that i then worked for geneseon that they create such an online interface for people exactly like you use um and i no longer think that's a good idea why um so so ten years ago i was literally trying to create utopia from my floss garden you know because you're one of the few people you're sort of the dream client for that website uh because of your experience and your dedication innocent data [music] i now know a lot more than i knew them and uh to be fairly candid with you i think it takes the resources of a pharma company to do a good job of going from omic data to um recommendations for supplement use or pharmaceutical use for that matter i think the use of pharmaceuticals for aging associated diseases right now is pretty much barbaric um the lack of appropriate use of relatively obtainable information about the genomes and transcriptomies of patients uh is a travesty i think that that is one of the most important growth areas of medicine if i may be very like uh if i may view the biomedical establishment from an altitude like the orbit of the moon um you have basic omic research which of course is going to depend more and more on machine learning because it's too damn complicated to make progress out of the way you can't find a result for one site in a genome or one transcript and transcriptome and invent a verbal story and go from there to a pharmaceutical it's ridiculous but machine learning can take you through the young lawyers and guide you and that's the work of omissists aided by machine learning people and of course that's a big you know activity right now in the world more and more companies are doing exactly what i just described you don't go from those companies to individuals in my opinion you go from those companies to big pharma or moderate-sized farmer and then you go from them to you know you don't even go to individual physicians you go to major healthcare providers like the nhs kaiser permanente and you have their biomedical scientists interacting with the pharma companies interacting with the big ohmic databases and ai servers to knit a very big challenging arc of technologies together that's how i now think 10 years later because i have the benefit of 10 additional years of very powerful and machine learning research with my colleagues so that that whole umbrella uh you know of of collaboration is going to take time that's not something that can develop you know quickly and not just that it's um you know once with data there becomes interpretation of the data and even with machine learning you know you're going to have an interpretation of your output right so even there you know there may be three or four different roads that lead to the same health health or lifespan extension and then it becomes i hear what you're saying in terms of the you know the different companies you know uh giving you the ability to use the machine learning the individual the ability to use the machine learning approach but uh not not to sound cynical but when you look at the at least the american health care system and how literally you know f that is uh now you're going to have a group of companies who won't let me do my own analysis but i have to follow what their analysis is and hope that their methods which may or may not be published uh are going to actually lead me on the right path so separately separately from that uh in terms of the uh just along the way i'll just comment mike that i totally accept your concerns yeah like i but i'm like you said i'm a different breed you know i want to be able to run analyses myself do the interpretation myself so that i can actually then make you know uh this reasonable decision or not right as opposed to leaving it in the hands of well you know better than you you know and i don't know so for many people maybe that's the case they'll appreciate that but i'm in a different boat okay okay let me just stop you there yep all right um so one of the reasons why i dropped the idea that i had 10 years ago which was you know google for michael's garden and not as good as you but aspiring to be as good was i came up with a different short-term bridge which is uh the age and ancestry appropriate tuning of diet and lifestyle and in 2020 with grant rutledge who i believe you've met and i know um it was his doctoral thesis we showed the relationship between evolutionary history both recent and long term and diet and uh speaking of somebody you know over 60 um who started down this journey about 10 years ago i have had far better results from tuning ordinary foods in terms of my particular evolutionary history than i have ever had in your vein of intervention um so i my ancestry is mostly from the northwestern periphery of eurasia which means i'm not as well adapted to agricultural foods as somebody who senses fruits middle eastern or salvation and um fairly early on in my life i started losing adaptation to agricultural foods and as i got older through middle age it got worse and worse and so for my ancestry as you approach as you get into middle age you have to eat fuel in fewer agricultural foods if my ancestry were entirely from australasia like original westerland before the europeans showed up um i should never have consumed agricultural foods you know like bread and milk are toxic for people with entirely indigenous sauce ancestor and um so there's a spectrum from the peoples who are wholly unadapted agricultural foods because they didn't eat them at all before 200 years ago which is like an instant in evolutionary time two people from you know places like iraq or pakistan would be very well adapted to grain-based and milk-based diets potentially into the 50s but i think by the time every human reaches their 60s they are no longer adapted to artificial foods because of the ways in which the forces of natural selection d2 with age and a response to a recent evolution of change which if people go to my google scholar page and look up the most recent publications in 2020 they'll see two in my opinion fantastic publications from grant rutledge r-u-t-l-e-d-g-e on how to tune your diet according to your ancestry it's someone that's evolutionary besides your own personal anecdote in in how getting rid of the grains in your in your diet actually improved your intestinal health but beyond that uh what i guess you didn't mention was that uh you actually switched uh fruit flies who are raised on uh in lab diets i guess it's on banana banana-based and molasses [music] closer to their ancestral diets which is what more apple-based or uh fruit fruit fly right so and that extended their lifespan relative to the lab-based diet of molasses or was it banana i can't can't remember it's banana and molasses and the banana and molasses diet is um a diet to which some of our populations have adapted to for a thousand generations that's actually longer than a period of time since the revolution in europe substantially longer and nonetheless they sometimes those flies perform better when young on their version their agricultural diet meaning their recent evolutionary diet but at later ages um like our 60s or late 50s a a diet they have not seen for a thousand generations is better for them uh which is if somebody had told me about this experiment 20 years ago i wouldn't believe it but but that's what the math suggested uh math done with my called larry muller um and that's what grant's experiments have shown is that long abandoned diets if you have if a species has recently changed its core dietary practices and by recently clearly means you know less than 10 000 generations so um and with respect to agricultural diets there's no human population which goes back more than a thousand generations on an agricultural diet so the principles are very general because the math is completely general it's not there's no nothing specific about group lines or humans in the math and it's very solid and grants strong influence experimentation has supported that mathematical result so that turns out to be a pretty fantastic multi-supplement approach where those supplements are really foods and you eliminate the toxic things which for people over 50 are grains rice corn food derived from milk from any manner and legumes and your health will get a lot better um it should also be said that brand new industrial food products that are novel to the human diet since 1850 nobody's adapted to high fructose corn syrup nobody's adapted to processed seed oils nobody's adapted to trans fats those are nobody's adapted to nitrites as a preservative those are somewhere in the toxin to poison spectrum so so then uh when considering when considering all right so i get i get that after a certain age we're not evolutionarily adapted you know we can get away with eating those foods at a younger age but when you get to a certain age and then we're just not evolutionarily adapted because millions of years of evolution we grew up you know we existed on a certain diet so but you know not that i'm trying to justify uh including the the foods that we didn't evolve uh eating but uh you know just as there are you know about five percent of centenarians who can get there by smoking cigarettes not that i would recommend smoking cigarettes you know because 95 of the people that there are are not smoking food but exactly i think at the end of the day it's important to uh you know have some objective markers of health because if somebody can't you know because if they enjoy eating in a certain way and they have biomarkers and health that suggests that overall it's either net neutral or beneficial then you know continue but i hear what you're saying for most people that is not going to be the case but it's region specific right as you mentioned okay so so mike um i totally endorse your core idea i just think it's an order of magnitude and maybe two words and more complicated than people now going to think um i do think the transcriptomic and metabolomic markers of health are in play right now and we will develop them this decade using gigantic omic databases and machine learning and i predict that there will be hundreds of transcriptomic and metabolomic markers of health and that your generic pharmaceutical statin glucophage or whatever will change at least tens of percents of those and some small fraction in positive ways and i predict a larger fraction in negative ways and if you don't then use machine learning itself to tune your own physiology with the resources of the pharma company behind you you're in a full zone because i mean i think you push the limit of what is now possible impersonal um and i you know i certainly think you are identifying some of the biomarkers that matter the only question in my mind is whether you're dealing with you know one percent or three percent right all the biomarkers we need to pay attention to yeah so that goes into the issue of does aging stop because obviously your lab has has data that shows that aging does indeed stop albeit towards the end of life most people would prefer it right we shifted that to the left so if you consider that if you have a biochemical phenotype of youth and you know what that looks like even if it's three percent or some percent more we don't know what the whole picture is that i'm actually studying but let's assume that it's more than three percent just for argument's sake if you know what the bible you know type of youth looks like and you actually actively intervene to maintain that for as long as you physically can before natural selection are no longer driving you to live that long right and now you are on the okay so in theory you could identify using uh you know objective biomarkers of health and uh uh you can identify a personal approach that can extend you uh for as long as your genetics will allow um so what do you think let me just stop you let me just talk to you qualitatively i totally endorse what you just said and i think in this century we would be doing exactly that but do you know who robert goddard was g-o-d-a-r-d the name sounds familiar but no he was the american pioneer of rocketry and he never had the kind of resources that vernon from von braun had a very good reason you know adolf hitler didn't run the united states at the arctic um uh and the nazis were total futurists when it came to technology unlike uh the united states before uh manhattan project um so robert goodard in the 20s and 30s was building rockets himself personally and they were nice rockets that they would like some of them got up to 18 feet high and you go well now we need to do is build bigger and better rockets and you know we'll be able to travel to the moon and qualitatively that's absolutely correct okay but to actually do it required really effing big rockets and it required a huge amount of technology much of which is the foundation of our current era okay from gps to computer programming and more and more miniaturized circuits and silicon chips and everything else precision metallurgy and so on so to me you're a figure like robert goodard you are building rockets but they're small relative to the task you set yourself um you are illustrating important principles of rocketry [music] and i guarantee you that werner von braun was reading robert goddard's publications and following his career with great interest remember he of course was the man behind the v2 rockets the nazis sent to england um and of course the man behind the saturn v launchers that actually got the apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s so we'll get there yeah we need we need your kind of research program on a thousand-fold scale and the question is how long will that take i can't i can't assume it's going to happen in 10 years it could take longer [music] we have a paper under review mike where we show pretty exactly how we're going to do this um in the sense of how you can use the machine learning to open up the yama hierarchy we have a series of papers that we do list over the next three or four years yes we're starting with fruit flies but we are starting with blue fly agent we are dealing with the genomics transcriptomics metabolics of doubling lifespan um so we are directly asking in a very powerful strong inference way what omicry tuning is required to retune lifespan physiology to double lifespan and i can tell you right now that the answer is hundreds of genomic sites affecting hundreds of transcripts affecting hundreds of metabolites which are in turn interconnected by thousands of pathways okay yeah so whereas whereas the early work uh was uh you know basically uh experimental evolution experimental evolutionary approach to dramatically extend lifespan now then it's the right it's the uh characterization the multi-oma characterization of the dramatically extended lifespan but then i see the next step being machine learning slash ai based approach to uh derive the best interventions right so that's the another layer exactly also exactly multi-generation you know uh or computational predictive uh you know it's right so it's you've you've got the machine learning that will come up with the prediction you run the experiments to see if it will work based on that data you retrain them the model retrains itself ai right so um yeah yeah but eventually the model will get good enough where it you know will lead to the the doubling or more of lifespan that you saw just using the experimental evolutionary approach exactly so you just described the next 10 years of my life cool okay um so uh i mean we feel that our publications over the next three years will show people we have all the tools to do this okay and i'm working with a pharmacological colleague mattabjafari i've been working with a few weeks now actually um so you know i've been interested in supplements and pharmaceuticals for a long time um and we uh together with jafari we've studied a lot of them um and now we're going to put it all together all the elements the machine learning and the pharmacology to show you know among other people to big pharma you know what they should be doing instead of what they do now which is you know uh beat the late 20th century is forced to death trying to get it to come up with some return on investment which is crashing through the zero alignment um uh yeah so but i think all this is going to happen in this decade i i think i think 10 years from now michael starting is going to be a happy man i hope so well 10 years okay we've got 75 so i'm 48 75 and 48 is 123. Break the human longevity record which is an extremely unlikely event considering that you know nine out of ten centenarians are women right so it's if i can science the uh you know okay so so that there's a misconception here um while the maximum longevity and longevity itself the total amount of time you live is a natural measure to focus on in aging research and i spent the first uh uh 20 years of my career focused on that number um more appropriate numbers our age specific mortality rates in age specific functional measures um basically longevity is a derivative of those things you don't need to wait until the day of death to know whether or not you've done something that works you i mean and you do this yourself mike you can look at measures for you know on a very short timeframe yeah um you know so so we don't have to wait 50 years to find out whether that stuff works right right right right and you'll have the benefits of it before then because of all of the you know aging-related phenotypes that will be improved as a result right so i mean your goal of having a really outstanding characterization of the biomarkers for human health i think we're going to do that in the next five or six years easily then the question would be you know figuring all the hierarchy of that we'll do that within two or three years of that biomarker landmark being treated and then you know within 10 years we'll be doing massive machine learning based interventions that go after the complete hierarchy from the hierarchy of you know so we didn't we didn't uh touch on it but uh drosophila have a microbiome too so yes talk about when you talk about the machine learning uh in terms of the genetics of drosophila longevity that's only maybe half of their equation just like approximately half of the human symbiont is human genes and microbial genes right so so have you have you uh have you looked into the co evolution uh adaptation of microbes my my former doctoral student uh professor parveen shawwastani at cal state fullerton is working on exactly that cool and she has publications she's writing on all those questions and you know she's a valued colleague of mine i look forward to continuing to work with her on these problems so very slowly and that will indeed be part of the story and of course the microbiome interacts profound with the body right in terms of the level in terms of lifespan extending effects i mean if you take those uh if you make flies that have uh you know been uh selected or you know to live twice or longer twice as long or longer take out their microbiome and transplant that into a short-lived fly would you get you know the twofold extension of lifespan what magnitude of the lifespan extending effectively okay so i can pretty much guarantee that wouldn't happen um because of other experiments we did that i'm not gonna publish um but uh trust me you will have answers to these questions this decade first and foremost because you know if you know the history of biology in the 20th century uh since 1910 we knew the heart experiments first with fruit flies and then very quickly we move on to people and other things um the fruit flies just get their first [music] is their small fast cheap yeah no it's a great i think it's a great model you can study you know thousands of generations in a much smaller period of time based on their life right so but you know the layers of reductionism you know you've got the the uh the drug based you know barbaric i'm gonna hit you with this one supplement and try to extend your lifespan by three percent uh but then even uh besides you guys you guys i'm sure are farthest from that the opposite extreme but even just using the machine learning approach just based on human data and not considering the microbiome which is ubiquitous everywhere in every grant nobody's thinking it's only it's it's all mtor and human aging genes foxone apoe right nobody's thinking about the other half of the equation and then we would need a machine learning based approach you know to see the interaction between those two in order to get the maximum effect right so absolutely correct yeah so yes once again once again like you have qualitatively exactly the right insight which makes me skeptical that it's gonna take uh longer than it should uh maybe not from you guys definitely not from you guys but for the rest of society who's working on this problem without thinking about it holistically the whole organism okay all right let me resort not to a metaphor but to a parallel um amazon is eating the world of retail amazon was started by jeff bezos out of the office and warehouse in seattle more than 25 years ago [music] when he started you know small operation you know uh with the bricks with the wood planks just doing books right only jeff bezos was heuristic enough to imagine what would come of it but that was always what he was thinking right i mean maybe he succeeded even more than jeff bezos could imagine but but i think he qualitatively got the idea um so you understand that everything i've been describing is about converting [music] just so biological confabulation where somebody with a phd who's mutated one or two pathways tells the story about sir two wings and aging right okay and they're saying this this is the aging gene and this is how we're gonna solve the problem which if it weren't for the fact that hundreds of millions of lives were at stake i would just break down laughing every time i heard that crime most people don't know though they follow that like it's uh you know the god of gods so right but most people have no idea of the machine learning and logistics that underlie what amazon does right yeah they just know they search for something and it shows up in from ups or whatever two days later um most people don't have to understand how the world works how many people do you think understand all the stuff that had to be done to get you know armstrong on the moon july of 1969. Okay so you can't worry about most people when you're engaged on a really difficult technological mission so i have been saying for more than 30 years that the project radically extended human lifespan which is what we're talking about today i've always made the parallel with the manhattan project in the public foundation which was really the third phase of the three-phase um nasa space program um mercury gemini um [music] and uh uh you know i've been working in the ancient field for 45 years now like um [music] uh and i've always uh bet that it was going to be complicated and i think i've won that then and i think those two and storytellers however much journalists like their stories because the journalists don't have a quantitative genetics background but almost nobody does um and therefore lap up the stories that those people tell i mean you know can't control it so along the along the bezos uh bezos analogy uh it got me thinking that you know p probably is that analogy it's a parallel parallel i mean i mean doing this will involve corporate resources on the scale of amazon yeah the whole goddamn company including amazon web services aws which is the most profitable part of the big multi-company corporate monologue that's the scale of resources it will take to double the human lifestyle but i think it's completely doable yeah given that it's run by the people who actually have the vision and the tools to get the job done the way it needs to be done yeah which is with the full appreciation of the complexity of the tents not just that i think there's a normal distribution so you're gonna have the field flooded the aging space flooded with and it's i see it now you know uh it you know investment in longevity based uh companies it's increasing i wouldn't explode but within that space you're gonna have a normal distribution right on average probably half half will fail half will be terrible half will be above average and then you'll have those few at the far right side of the normal distribution that you know uh just taking it back to uh bezos again you know you know just using that example he probably wasn't the only one with that idea there were probably probably many that had that idea and for whatever reason whatever innovation innovation that he had whatever approach that he used it was better right he it's it's evolution he he you know found a way to be better than his competitors right so he survived and for a long time well i'll say a couple of important things about jeff bezos um number one very smart guy number two very driven guy i know lots of smart people who like drive um number three made a point of going step by step and scaling up aggressively okay he knew that what he was doing would be really really hard and unlike the people who started some of the other online commerce businesses he fought tenaciously to sustain the vision to surmount the difficulties and he just kept on going okay and always pushing the frontier all the technologies multiple technologies that had to be combined to accomplish this mission and that's what this you know doubling human lifespan will take yeah okay it will not be achieved by some flashy professor telling a cute story about one or two genes right right right that is exactly wrong um it will instead be accomplished by a gigantic uh consortium probably consortium yes i think that's a good term consortium of very big companies doing very hard things very well on a very big scale this is not you know a nobel prize type project it is a you know manhattan project new atomic bomb it's uh like the uh nasa mission to space going from mercury to gemini to apollo which costs a vast amount of money in present-day dollars and it's like the building of amazon what's like those three kinds of things yeah so so the point i was getting at with that is let's say that there are four companies in that space they're massively funded through the public governments whatever so which approach is going to end up being the dominant approach right and they're all using machine learning they're all using ai for companies all in anti-aging right so the point i was just going to make was that uh you know probably the one that looks at it from the holistic right not it's not one one or two genes like that crowd it's not gonna be one or two supplements like that crowd it isn't going to doesn't english going to be ai on the human genome i was just going to make the point that it's it's going to be on the whole the whole thing it's going to be on the mic the combination of how the microbes interact with humans and the whole machine learning based approach on that um and uh you know i hate to say that i don't see that approach now i don't see it i don't see any groups going at it holistically like that now i hope that it will evolve eventually um but uh okay so i i will just say i don't know if you've read my book the one tomorrow but um the papers there i described the papers that were in it though i don't know if it was that book i read one of the books you have it's uh with it's like stacked with papers it's like a it's like that's methuselah flies yeah uh but i i the companion book to that the the companion book to my collection of papers which is called with diesel advice the companion book that sort of tells the story just in words with no data and no math just the narrative is called the long tomorrow and there toward the end i talk about what happened as i tried to launch this really big enterprise um first with nia which was a complete fiasco and then with a succession of companies um and uh i've never been in jeff bezos position where i could marshall the resources to get things done my way which is basically his way which is to say appreciating all the complexity and appreciating all the difficulty and not just telling cute stories that people find intuitively palatable but instead uh building something big enough to do the hard work the beauty of it is that the advent of the ohmic technologies and modern-day machine learning makes dealing with complexity in any large-scale enterprise easier and easier so the whole world has been developing the tools to make the mission that i conceived of you know more than 30 years ago possible so there's never been a better time to do things my way okay um and you know whether or not i get to actually be involved i hope i do um [music] it's it's like you know the geocentric model of the universe was eventually going to fail um people like copernicus galilei and newton you know made sure that it ended up dead and buried all right and they got to have the fun of doing that i've spent 45 years trying to kill off reduction of simple-minded stories about aging and frankly one of my doctoral advisors had spent the preceding 15 years doing that as well um so between the two of us it's like 60 years of evolutionary geneticists trying to kill off stupid gerontology stupid gerontology right now is flourishing because so many people want it to be true and you must understand the heliocentric model in the solar system was not popular with the general population in 1642 the year that galileo died and was born but it was going to win anyway because it was the truth okay the complexity of aging is simply the reality of aging the beauty of where we live now in 2021 is we now have tools for handling the complexity of aging um and for demonstrating the reality of the complexity so i mean every year my lab publishes with other labs more evidence for the complexity of what's going on and how the complexity matters and every year the reductionists will ignore that work and go on telling their stories about sirtuins or whatever pathway they're infatuated with the boxo or you know tor whatever and um i'm not saying they're never right i'm saying that they never have more than a piece of the story small [music] as you said of my approach but they've got even smaller you know i would say that that you're greatly ahead of them yeah um for now but uh human minds cannot compete with machine learning when it comes to ionic hierarchy definitely human hierarchy is too damn complicated for the human mind to tell stories about it you're talking about crunching huge amounts of numbers so do you think it's going to be possible that so i've seen some of the ohmic-based studies that have come out whether it's uh metabolomics associated with you know aging or uh you know transcriptome pictomic right so uh so usually they there are metabolic clocks that are predictive of say a biological age and then there are other there are other blood-based uh composites that aim to do the same thing so when comparing the correlations between the regularly measured which is one reason why i focus on that now the regularly measured things like albumin creatinine glucose etc uh the predictive ability of even the well granted it's a small snapshot of the circulating uh spectrum of metabolites anyway because then you can make the argument you're only getting 10 or so of all of the metabolic rate blood right so yeah what i was getting so right now we have right now we have the technology to detect millions of metabolites from the human so right now the the best performing metabolism i hear you i hear you but yeah the the best performing top metabolic clocks are as good as these blood-based composites bigger bigger you know uh biomarkers quote unquote of biologically so do you think it's going to be possible and i know this sounds reductionist but you know uh whereas there's great data and tremendous pathway information in the metabolome wouldn't it be isn't it possible that even the best before performing metabolomic clock as it relates to biological age could be reproduced with a panel of commercially available biomarkers that are already measured but you know for example albumin is the predominant uh you know by concentration protein and blood um so you know these aren't small specks of proteins that are floating around and you're trying to make a picture by looking at these big picture cortical biomarkers you think it's possible that you know once all the ohmic stuff is mapped and the multi-omic uh uh stuff is mapped isn't it also possible that some of these traditionally measured biomarkers could be as good or in the ballpark at least as good as the multi-ohmic-based approach for uh i actually did a calculation like that um i can't remember when i published it it's about 30 years ago that i did the calculation um so we did experiments where we specifically tuned metabolites in particular we tuned um triglyceride level glycogen trellos and water and um you know three or four gross metabolic components of the one and uh tuning them uh predicted thirty percent of the early extension of lifespan of that uh here's the kicker mike when you tune those metabolites still further you then went downward on longevity so it was a curvilinear relationship with the negative second derivative for those pathways but i guess what i'm getting at is internally you know you've got markers of liver health kidney health immune right okay so so without so if you're if you're simultaneously optimizing or as close to optimizing as you can get multi as many organ systems as you can in theory the big picture biomarkers i i mean i'm probably going to be wrong eventually because big you can't compete with big data it's i'm throwing stones and somebody's firing rockets again right so yeah yeah in theory at least now based on on these multi on these omic clocks that uh are in comparison with these other even epigenetic age you know which is uh another level above you know um so far the ohmic based yeah mark because you can only get a you know correlation of one right so if your correlation for the epigenetic clock is 0.97 and you're okay so okay okay so i really appreciate this conversation it's very high quality there's something a lot of people don't understand about what we can now do with machine learning that even a lot of people in the machine learning community don't fully understand there are ways to use machine learning to get not just that correlates with predictors but to actually delineate pathways of causality even when you have a whole forest of corals there are ways to get a causality and uh and this is something that we're going to be showing within year two um i mean to some extent we've already published on that in our 2018 paper um so some of the hundreds of genomic changes and the hundreds of transcriptomic changes matter very very little and some of them matter a lot even though as category predictors they are working [music] are all correlated with each other you can fish out things that will give you 95 to 97 percent of the effect that are a small larry moore likes to say sparse subset of all the things that are going on and and that that's that's stuff we're going to show the world over the next 10 years cool um so uh a lot of the very appropriate riddles and conundrums you're surfacing we're working on we have been working on since actually 2012. Um and you know we started our publication stream in 2017 it will continue um and over the course of this decade i hope that we do a very powerful transition from demonstrating the real scientific principles underlying control of asia and moving that into large private sector entities which start to develop amazon scale resources for humans problems because that's the scale at which successful interventions will be achieved cool cool so if you're not in that same sphere in terms of the bezel jeff bezos of amazon michael rose in aging with this multi-alma based you know uh machine learning based so many things to consider here the ai based ohmic driven path to extending health and lifespan that's the road yeah so you're it's good so that's that's where i see uh and hope that you know you'll uh you'll be in the near future right so that that is my hope also but you know taking a long-term sort of history of science and technology perspective that is what's going to happen this century inevitably it's just sort of on people like you and me to get it to happen sooner you know so ideally i'm involved in a company uh 10 years from now that harvesting might my grants are up next you know near future so maybe uh sooner than later uh so yeah you know this has to be a very large enterprise brings in ultimately billions of dollars worth of capital and people and resources that to do something that is very hard but i would assert doable you remember i started out my career postponing nature i mean for me doubled lifespans or troubled lifespans with great robustness and everything you would want that's my everyday reality i go to the lab and i see it right in front of my eyes it's like i know it's there to be done okay i just need the reductionists to get out of the goddamn way so i can do it yeah okay we need to have journalists stop buying into their confabulations which is the more polite word for something that's more agricultural um uh so that we can get the resources to actually do this for real yeah all right michael rose dr michael rose uc irvine i greatly appreciate your time and uh all of your thoughts and our conversations so uh uh with that i say thank you and i guess uh talk to you next time total pleasure
