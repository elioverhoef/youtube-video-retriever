# I've Got A Big Problem In My Oral Microbiome (Serratia marcescens), But Also A Plan To Reduce It

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For previous oral microbiome tests i focused most of the attention on alzheimer's disease related bacteria a few of which are shown here and they include p gingivalis f nucleatum and tannerella foria but it may be more important to first get rid of a different bacterium which is known as sadia maresin which i'll refer to as sadia for short in this video going forward sadia adversely impacts many human health related outcomes and that's what we can see here so just to illustrate a few it impacts pneumonia sepsis menitis and you can see that there's a pretty long list so with that in mind why wasn't this bacterium mentioned in earlier videos and that's because from my first oral microbiome test it looked like a standard profile with no major outliers and that's what we'll see here and these are some of the bacteria that we're on test number one so on the left we've got microbial species bristles test doesn't just include bacteria so i've included microbial which includes things like fungi like candida too and then on the right we've got relative abundance in percent so percent relative abundance and we can see that my first test was in june of 2022 note that these data are generated as i mentioned by bristle discount link in the video's description if you want to track your own oral microbiome so as i mentioned i've been spending most of my time in these videos on the oral microbiome on these alzheimer's disease related bacteria which are highlighted there in red and we can see that i have and still have those bacterium in my oral microbiome and although they're at low levels i don't want them there at all and in terms of no crazy outliers we can see that although i do have relatively high amounts of a rothia species at about 21% and streptococus mtis at about 12% and there'll be more on that bacterium coming later uh there wasn't anything out of the ordinary and we'll see why that's true in a second but this was actually test number two because for test number one i had very high levels of that sadia species and note when i said crazy outlier 88% of all bacteria were just that one bacter iium and that far dwarf what we can see for that rothia species at 21% so that first test was thought to be contaminate contaminated with this sadia species so bristle removed it from all following tests but sadia kept appearing in very high amounts in my oral microbiome and that's what we'll see here so although it went down a bit for test number three to 41% of all bacteria and somehow went down to zero for test number four we can see that for tests five and six it went even higher to 95% of all bacteria i mean only 5% of the the rest of my or microbiome being nons seraia maresin is just outrageous so is this contamination or real effect so i reached out to bristle to get more insight and they informed me that within their users 90% around 90% have absolutely zero of this sadia species so if it was a contamination issue we'd expect that there would be a greater prevalence in their cohort 7 to 9% have less than 1% relative abundance so up to 99% have very low levels less than 1% of sadia this sadia species in their cohort and then we can clearly see which group i'm in i'm in that 1 to 3% that have above 1% and this is and again above 1% this is in three of six tests i have greater than 88% abundance so what can get rid of sadia maress so i went to pubmed and did a search and came across a study where in vitro so this is in cell culture seraia maren's growth is inhibited by 5% xylitol and that's what we'll see here so we've got a control plate that's filled with sadia and then in the presence of 5% xol we can see that all of that red which is how seria stains is almost completely gone and more directly we can quantify see that quantified here so on the y- axis we've got percent bofilm formation for that seria species in controls so you can see 100% in the controls and then when 5% xyloto was added to the plate we can see about an 80% reduction for sadium maresins so with that in mind i made a homemade mouthwash different from the mouthwashes in my earlier videos somewhat different but at a higher concentration of xylitol using exactly 5% xylitol as they did in this study to see if it would work in vivo not just in vitro so that's 5 gram of xylol per 100 ms of water and it made an actually a bigger stock i made a 400 mil solution so 20 g of xotl and dissolved it and then i used this mouthwash 3 to five times per day at various times throughout the day for 1 month so did 5% xylol reduce levels of this sadia species and i wish i could say that it did but unfortunately it did not and that's what we can see here so for test number seven which was in july of 2023 using 5% xylol as i mentioned many times throughout the day for 30 days we can see the sadia was at my highest level uh to date at 96% of all bacteria so only 4% are not sertic which again is just outrageous so this sent me back to the drawing board which in my case is pubmed for what can potentially reduce sadium maresin so i came across this paper which is 40 years old hydrogen peroxide mediated antagonism against sadium maresin by strep theus midas in other words streptococus midas through hydrogen peroxide generation can inhibit growth of seraia marcassin and there weren't any pretty pictures in the paper but in a screenshot from that paper just highlighting we can see that streptococus midas strain number 17-1 antagonized the growth of 24 different test trins of sadium maresin so that seems like very good news so then i did a search for probiotics for strepto streptococus m midas maybe i can take it as an oral probiotic increasing its increasing its levels and that should be able to reduce sadium orins however streptococus midas isn't commercially available as a probiotic so so the good news is though that this bacterium streptococus midas is in my oral microbiome and i noticed an interesting trend so during the four tests when sadia was 88% or higher note that streptococus midas was very low less than 4% in each of these tests and if there is a direct association between these two based on that paper it would seem to be true at least in my data just observationally in support of that during those two tests when somehow seraia was zero note that my streptococus minus levels were at their highest amounts ever about 12 and 11% and for that intermediate test when seraia maress was 41% we can see an intermediate level of streptococus midas so this suggests that maybe if i can increase streptococus midas i can reduce sadium maresin but then it got me thinking maybe i just don't need one bacteria maybe i can use a team effort so with that in mind could increasing other oral bacteria help limit this seria species and if so how can i increase ser uh streptococus midas and these others so to investigate that i looked at oral bacteria that are inversely associated with sadia over those seven studies so bacteria versus bacteria correlation analysis and just looking at the ones that were the most abundant so we've got bacterial species on the right unari on the left and the average abundance of these bacteria on the left and the reason why that's important is because there were a lot more bia that were significantly associated with sadia inversely associated which means relatively higher levels of these other or bacteria lower levels of sadia but i i think it makes the most sense to focus on the bacteria oral bacteria that are of the highest relative abundance so if i have a bacterium that's at 3% i'd expect the bacterium that's there at 5% because there's more of it to be better able to get rid of if it can sadia in my oral microbiome so these are the most abundant bacteria that are significantly inversely correlated with sadia and we can see that by using the p value so this is only using a p value less than 0.05 i didn't adjust for multiple comparisons and i'm sure there are going to be people who are criticizing me for that in the comments i'm happy to explain why i'm not using that in this case so uh if you want more on the fdr story please leave a comment and i'd be happy to discuss it and then we can see the r the correlation coefficient for each of these eight bacteria are negative which means when these bacteria are relatively higher that's significantly inversely correlated or there are lower levels of this sadium maresin species as shown there each are negatively correlated so then note at the top of the list with a correlation coefficient of ne99 remember a perfectly linear correlation is a correlation coefficient of ne1 in this case we can see the seria is there but then also those seven other species and again each together in a relatively high abundance so the sum of these bacteria is about 24% of all bacterium so i want a team effort to try to get rid of this sadia species if i can by by increasing levels of these bacterium so how can i do that what can i do to increase levels of these bacteria could diet have a role so what i did then is i lined up because i track diet every day and i do that by a food scale for those who are new new to the channel i've done that since 2015 i lined up the previous 30-day dietary average for both macros micros and individual foods and that the then i have an average dietary intake that corresponds to each oral microbiome test because i have seven oral microbiome tests i can investigate correlations for diet with these bacteria so is there a common dietary pattern that may posibly impact these bacteria potentially reducing sadia so first let's start with the obvious correlations for for or correlations with seraia maresin because that may have the most direct effect if i can look at correlations for diet in potentially reducing sadia so we can see that there were only two foods that had a p value less than 0.05 and again the fdr issue comes up again because i'm going to show correlations for eight more bacteria there are about 100 uh different variables for each of these uh assessments so i'm potentially looking at 900 comparisons without adjusting for multiple comparisons and again i'm happy to discuss this in the comments i think the issue of replication across multiple back bacterial species is a potentially more powerful approach but again i'm happy to discuss this in the comments so in terms of foods or nutrients that were sign sorry significantly associated sorry significantly correlated with serat market t we can see that there are only two based on a nominal p value or p value less than 0.05 first up is protein intake so a relatively higher protein protein intake is significantly correlated with higher sadium maresins in my data now my protein intake range isn't very wide for these seven tests but it suggests that when i eat at the lower end of that range 96 gram per day sadia is lower and when i eat at the higher end of my range 99 g seraia is higher and i know that that may may not seem like a big range but to follow the correlations i'd expect if correlation can impact causation i would expect this to be true by following the correlations lower end of the protein intake i may be able to impact sadia but again i don't just think it's going to be one dietary factor we can see that lowfat yogurt and it won't go into why it's lowfat yogurt i if anyone's interested please leave a comment i have a video on lowfat versus high fat in my data please leave a comment i'd be happy to to describe that there so now we can see an inverse see significant inverse correlation between lowfat yogurt with sadia in other words when lowfat yogurt is at the high end of my range which is 150 gram per day there is lower sadia and when yogurt is at the low end of my range that's significantly correlated with higher sadia so these are easy to follow but again i want to see a common dietary pattern if it exists so i then looked at correlations for each of the eight bacterial species that are significantly inversely correlated with sadia so higher levels of these bacteria lower levels of sadia and again that's a cor ation it's not causation so just to highlight a few notice mushrooms so mushrooms are inversely correlated with streptococus infantis that's potentially a bad thing because we want higher levels of that bacterium and that data suggests that when i eat a higher mushroom intake that's significally correlate with lower levels of that bacteria so with that in mind i should eat towards the lower end of my mushroom range if that may relieve some suppression on growth growth of that oral bacterium but it isn't just that mushrooms show up in correlation with that bacterium note that it pops up in many other places six of the eight bacteria also have significant inverse correlations for mushrooms in other words maybe too much mushrooms which have positive correlations with my blood biomarkers may be bad in very high amounts for my oral microbiome so that's an very easy fix i can eat towards the lower end of my range for mushrooms no big deal all right what about other foods that have a common dietary pattern well notice again low-fat yogurt pops up in this case with four of the eight bacteria that are inversely associated with sadia and in the same direction so a relatively higher lowfat yogurt intake is significally correlated with four of those bacteria in my oral microbiome so again that's a relatively easy fix just increasing yogan intake from 135 to 150 g per day so in using that same approach across all nine of these bacterial species there are some patterns so besides mushrooms and yogurt we can see that onions so when onions are at the high end of my range that's significant cor with higher sadia so i can cut my onion intake to the low end of my range which is unfortunate because i like onions they add taste and flavor uh so the low end of my range is zero so that'll be the plan for the next test also protein is significally correlated with three of these eight bacteria in addition to sadia so i'm going to eat again towards 96 gram per day is the goal and then in terms of replication i only looked at uh nutrients that were found in at least two of the nine comparisons so that's true for cinnamon pistachio vitamin e b2 and beta crypto anthan so i plan on following the correlations there just as an example pistachios are posibly correlated with two of these bacteria so that suggest eating towards the high end of my range but that two is an easy easy fix i can go a little bit higher to test that correlation so i've increased it to 15 gram per day my expectation is that by following as many of these correlations as possible for the next test i may see an improvement for seria but i should mention i don't know if it works if it doesn't work i'll recalculate the correlations for oral bacteria with sadia going forward and that will be the plan until i can come up with a better plan all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole
