# Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins Increase NAD

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tryptophan is converted into nad by the day novo nad synthesis pathway and as we saw in an earlier video an age-related decline for vitamin b6 or paradoxyl 5-phosphate p5p may limit this conversion of tryptophan into nad but there's probably another age-related block in this pathway and it involves quinolinic acid or quinolinate quinolinic acid levels increase during aging and that's what we can see here starting with data in people that had a median age of 59 years at baseline and then 11 years later we can see that there was a significant increase for their quinolinate or quinolinic acid levels what about people that were older than 70 years though and that's we can see here and this is data in centenarians quinolinate data in centenarians or close to centenarians that had an average age of 97 years and when compared with their offspring we can see that there was a 2.8 fold or close to three-fold higher level of quinolinate in the centenarians when compared with their offspring so then we can see that quinolinic acid levels increase during aging in conjunction with that age-related decline for nad so for quinolinate to accumulate during aging the enzymes that converted into nad must be affected which then raises a question can we increase nad levels by targeting those enzymes so let's take a deeper look at those enzymes because knowing what they are that's the first step in being able to biohack it or optimize it and that's what we can see here so this this again is the day novo nad synthesis pathway starting with tryptophan and then we've got quinolinic acid over there and then note that there are three enzymes it isn't one enzymatic step as shown on the previous slide there are three enzymes that convert quinolinic acid into nad the first is q qprt or quinolinic phosphoribrocil transferase the second is nmn aden allele transferase and the third is nad sin-1 or nad synthase so can gene expression of these three genes be increased thereby increasing intracellular levels of nad and interestingly the answer is yes grape seed proanthocyanidines or pac pack increase expression of qprt and that's what we can see here with qprt mrna levels so this is gene expression of qprt and these data are in rats young rats that were fed grape seed proanthocyanidins and then four different diets were fed so zero is no proanthocyanidines and then increase increasing levels 5 25 and 50. Proanthocyanidines milligrams of proanthos anidence per kilogram of food and there we can see pretty close to a dose response curve here so as the content of proanthocyanidins in the diet increased qprt gene expression also increased now grapeseed parenthocyanins didn't just increase expression of qprt it also increased expression of nad synthase one and that's we can see here with nad synthase-1 gene expression on the y-axis again plotted against the content of pac on the x and there in this case the lowest dose of proanthocyanidins increased gene expression of nad synthase-1 and although higher levels of grape seed paranthocyanidins increased nad synthase-1 gene expression we can see that that level plateaued after five milligrams per kilogram of proanthocyanidines now increasing gene expression is nice it's good news but did grape seed parental cyanide and supplementation increase nad that's what we all care about and that's we can see here this is nad content and both the gene expression data and the nad content data is in the liver and there we can see that although the lowest dose of proanthocyanidins did not increase any d content in liver we can see that both 25 and 50 milligrams per kilogram did indeed increase nad content and interestingly 50 milligrams of proanthos anidence per kilogram food we can see that that's about a four-fold increase for nad content so from this study in rats we can see that grape seed proanthocyanins increased liver levels of nad all right so what's the human equivalent dose based on this study so the body size conversion from rats to humans is to divide by 6.2 so when taking the highest dose used in the study the 50 milligrams of parenthal synonyms per kilogram food which had the biggest effect on nad levels and dividing that by 6.2 we get the human equivalent dose of 8.1 milligrams of promethocyanate cyanidines per kilogram of body weight now just to put it in context my current average body weight is six about 66 kilograms so when multiplying the human equivalent dose by my body weight we get a human equivalent dose of 536 milligrams of grapeseed paranthocyanins per day now note that this isn't the only study to show an nad increase with grape seed proanthocyanidin supplementation and that's what we can see here so now we've got the relative nad content and these are plasma levels of nad first looking at age-related changes and these data are in mice starting with two-month-old mice and then 12 and 18 months old we can see that nad levels decline during aging plasma levels of nad decline during aging and then 18 month old mice were fed grape seed proanthocyanin extract or gspe and in this study the dose was higher than in the rat study so here 250 milligrams of parenthocyanins per kilogram body weight nonetheless we can see that there was a big jump in plasma levels of nad in response to grape seed paranthocyanidines now just as a side note they didn't look at the quinolinic the conversion of quinolinic acid to nad in this study but they did report data for nampt which converts niacinamide into nmn so the authors of this study theorize that it's probably making grapese parenthose anidence are probably making nmn more bioavailable or increasing the content of nmn and then that's being converted into nad all right so just like we did for the rat study what's the human equivalent dose so the body size conversion from mice to humans is a little bit different than for rats so for this we divide by 12.3 and then when dividing 250 milligrams of grape seed parenthocyanin extract by kilogram body weight by 12.3 we get a human equivalent dose of 20.3 milligrams of proanthocyanins per kilograms of human body weight and then when multiplying that by my current body weight just for perspective we get a human equivalent dose to potentially get a boost in nad with a little bit more than 1300 milligrams of grape seed paranthocyanin cyanide and extract per day now note that if you're familiar with this channel i prefer whole foods over supplements and for those who want a supplement that's great but i prefer whole foods try to get my grape seed parenthes cyanidins so with that in mind what's the proanthocyanin content in grape seeds and that's what we can see in this study that looked at pro-anthocyanin content in seeds from 37 different grape seed varieties and there weren't any pretty pictures but in looking at a screenshot from that study we can see that the average proanthocyanin and content in grape seeds is about 160 milligrams per seed so when dividing the rat study which had 536 milligrams of grape seed paranthosandines per day to get that nad increase when dividing that by about 160 milligrams of paranthocyanidins per gram of seed we get 3.4 grams of grape seeds grape seed grape seeds per day to get the 536 milligrams of grape seed proanthocyanidins per day for the mouse study 1344 milligrams of grapeseed parental cyanidins would translate into 8.4 grams of grape seeds per day so note that there aren't any human studies so will grape seeds or its extract increase nad in people so with that in mind i started with six grams of grape seed powder on just a couple of days ago on june 7th and the plan is to test relatively soon to see if this works using nad's ginfiniti's nad test so i'm going to test about a week from now on june 19th now i'm open to going higher to maybe even doubling my dose of grape seed powder to about 12 grams per day but if that doesn't work i'm probably back to the nad salvage pathway and trying to increase niacin nr or nmn all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics any dequantification with jinfinity as i just mentioned green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox which has a different panel than the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or diatron brand that link and all the other discount links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
