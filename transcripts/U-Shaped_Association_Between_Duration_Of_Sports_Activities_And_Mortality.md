How many hours of weekly exercise is optimal for health to help answer that let's have a look at a study that was published last month where they identified a u-shaped association for the duration of sports activities with all-cause mortality risk so first what did these sports activities include so pa or physical activity included tennis badminton soccer and handball but also more commonly performed uh sports activities or exercises including cycling swimming jogging calisthenics health club activities and weight lifting now associations for low levels of physical activity with all-cause mortality risk makes sense because that's been shown in previous studies but is too much physical activity actually bad for health so let's have a look at the data so first this is a study of about 8 800 people that had an average age of about 57 years and starting with a baseline assessment of weekly duration of sports activities uh deaths were followed up up to 26 years later so this is a relatively long study and then let's have a look at data for the fully adjusted model which they've defined as the extended multivariate model so after looking at the association for duration of sports activities with all-cause mortality risk they included these other variables in the model because they may confound the association between duration of sports activities with all-cause mortality so when uh first looking at the reference in this case which was defined as people who exercise from 2.6 to 4.5 hours per week so that's about 20 to 40 minutes a day we can see that having lower levels of weekly exercise so zero to 2.5 hours per week was associated with significant increases for all cause mortality risk 41 for people who reported no weekly exercise and 21 increase for people who reported up to two and a half hours per week for these exercises so also look at look at the data for more than 10 hours per week we can see also a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk of 22 percent so that's why both low and high levels of physical activity or that u-shaped association is present for uh significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so what's contributing to these associations so let's have a look at some of the data that they presented in the paper including smoking bmi sex and age so first let's start with current and former smokers so when compared with the reference which in this case again was 2.6 to 4.5 hours of these sports activities per week we can see that both lower and higher levels of weekly exercise was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so what about never smokers so again starting with the reference we can see that both lower amounts of weekly sports activities so less than two and a half hours per week but also more than 4.6 hours per week were not significantly associated which i've delineated as ns with an increased all-cause mortality risk so from this we can conclude that that u-shaped association that's mentioned in the title of this paper for weekly sports activities with an increased all-cause mortality risk is significant only in current and former smokers and not in never smokers so which other variables may be driving this u-shaped association so let's have a look at body mass index and starting with people who were of a normal weight which is a bmi between 18.5 and 24.9 kilograms per meter squared so first again looking at the reference when compared with the reference we can see that there was an increased all-cause mortality risk for people who were sedentary who reported no weekly sports activities but people who reported more than 4.6 hours per week of these exercises did not have a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so from that we can conclude that there is no u-shaped association for the duration of weekly sports activities with all-cause mortality risk in people with a bmi between 18 and a half and 24.9 all right so what about in overweight and obese people so overweight is classified as a bmi of 25 to 30 and obese is classified as having a bmi greater than 30. So again starting with the reference or when compared with the reference we can see significant increases for all-cause mortality risk for weekly duration of sports activities that were less than two and a half hours per week and also higher uh uh people who reported sports activities that were higher than 4.6 hours per week also had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so there we do see the u-shaped association for an increased all-cause mortality risk uh in people with a bmi of greater than 25 but not in people who had a bmi between 18 and a half and 24.9 all right so let's take this further let's have a look at how the data looks in men and women so let's start with the data in women uh and when compared with the reference again uh people who uh women who reported uh weekly duration of weekly sports activities for 2.6 to four and a half hours per week we can see that only zero hours per week sedentary behavior was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in women but more than 4.6 hours per week was not significantly so associated with mortality risk so from that we can conclude that there was no u-shaped association for the duration of weekly sports activities with all-cause mortality risk in women so what about the data in men so again when compared with the reference we can see that having men who reported exercising less than two and a half hours per week had significant increases for all-cause mortality risk and similarly men that reported a duration of weekly sports activities that were greater than 4.6 hours per week also had an increase significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so from this we can see that that u-shaped association for weekly sports activities with an increased all-cause mortality risk is significantly significant only for men and not for women all right so let's go through one more of these uh let's have a look at age so in uh people that were younger than 60 years old when compared with the reference only people who were younger than 60 that reported no sports activities no weekly sports activities sedentary behavior was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk but people younger than 60 that reported exercising more so uh 4.6 to greater than 10 hours per week that was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk so for people younger than 60 there's no u-shaped association for the duration of weekly sports activities with all-cause mortality risk so what about people older than 60 so again when compared with the reference we can see that people who exercised for less than two and a half hours a week had significant increases for all-cause mortality risk but people who reported exercising more than 4.6 hours per week and greater than 10 hours per week did not have significant increases for all-cause mortality risk so that u-shaped association for duration of weekly sports activities with all-cause mortality risk is not significant people younger than 60 or in people older older than 60. So from this we can conclude that there is no u-shaped association for this association with weekly sports activities for the duration of that with all-cause mortality risk in people of any age so to take it back to the title where they uh stated that there was a u-shaped association between the duration of sports activities and mortality but i wish that they would clarify would have clarified this and you know put this more up front where this is true only in current and former smokers in men and in people with a bmi of greater than 25 at least in this study note that the u-shaped association was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk for uh never smokers for women and for people who had a bmi less than 25 all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
