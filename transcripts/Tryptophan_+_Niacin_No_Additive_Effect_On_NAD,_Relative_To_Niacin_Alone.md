# Tryptophan + Niacin: No Additive Effect On NAD, Relative To Niacin Alone

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For ned test number seven we saw my highest level to date 67 micromolar and i was able to achieve that by supplementing with 654 mig of nasin per day more specifically nicotinic acid na nicotinic acid is converted by three enzymatic steps into nad so for this most recent test nad test number eight i wanted to try something a little different more specifically to see if the combination of niin and tryptophan could further raise nad and that's because as shown here with the day noo nad synthesis pathway tryptophan is converted into nad so for the 16-day period starting from july 5th the date of the last test to july 20th the day before this test average nicotinic acid intake was 862 milligrams per day and average tryp thean intake during that same 16 days was 688 milligrams per day but note that i just started supplementing with tryptophan for the 10day period before the test 1 g per day and similar nicotinic acid during that 10-day period was in the same ballpark as for test number 7 659 mg per day and then i sent blood to gfinity for nad analysis discount link in the video's description if you want to do that yourself and as we can see my nad level still remained relatively high at 59 micromolar which is in the same ballpark as where it was for test number 7even 67 micromolar but note that there was no additive effect for the combination of tryp thean and n which raises the obvious question should i then take trip thean out because it clearly didn't push nad levels even higher so for the next test i'm actually going to try the opposite of that and i'm going to see if tryp thean on its own can increase nad without nasin and there are a few reasons for that one is in previous experiments we saw that i may not have an age related block for vitamin b6 or for the conversion of quinolinic acid into nad with the grape seed powder experiment so i still think it's possible that tryptophan on its own can increase nad and to test that i'm going to go i'm going to double the dose to 2 g per day bringing my total trip thean dose including through diet to 3 g per day and i'll if i can't get that uh increase with tryp thean on its own i i'll return to nin no problem probably in the 600 milligram per day range again i intend on retesting on 8:21 august 21st doing a full blood panel on the same day so stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bi hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics ned quantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing with scifox health and note that their panel is almost completely different from the atome metabolomics including apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy your coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
