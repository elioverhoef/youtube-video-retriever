# ApoB: Is Lower Always Better?

April b is found in non-hdl cholesterol more specifically it's in ldl lipoprotein a idl or intermediate density lipoprotein and vldl very low density lipoprotein and there we can see apo b100 found in each of these lipoproteins or april b for short now note that april b is not found in hdl which instead has apo a1 so why is april b important april b may be a better marker of coronary heart disease risk when compared with ldl and that's what we'll see here on the x-axis we've got the odds ratio of chd and this is a study of about 441 000 people so first starting with ldl cholesterol we can see that it's confidence interval when compared with the hazard ratio of one completely overlaps with that hazard ratio of one such that it wasn't significantly associated with chd risk in this study in contrast apob for apob we can see that its confidence interval is completely above one in other words it's a significantly higher risk for chd in association with relatively higher levels of apob and we can see that that's a significant effect there with the p-value now note that april b may be a better marker of dementia risk 2 when compared with ldl and that's what we'll see in this study of about 469 000 people that looked at all cause dementia hazard ratios or all cause dementia risk and note that all cause dementia is alzheimer's disease vascular dementia and other dementias so in this study they looked at all cause dementia risk for april b in association with april b and ldl on the left we've got the relatively low levels of able b and ldl and on the right relatively higher levels so first for april b we can see that its confidence interval is completely above that hazard ratio of one so in other words relatively higher apob is significantly associated with an increased risk for all cause dementia in contrast ldl its confidence interval completely overlapped with the hazard ratio of one so it's not significantly associated with all cause dementia risk so based on these data from these two studies that suggests that relatively lower april b may be better for health but is that true is lower always better for april b more specifically what about all-cause mortality risk so that's what we'll see here in the study of about 94 000 people we've got apob on the y-axis and then we've got two outcomes cardiovascular mortality risk in the open circles and then all cause mortality risk in the black diamonds and then these data first are in 39 to 59 year olds so when compared with the referent which was 1.24 to 1.39 grams per liter for apob we can see that relatively higher levels higher than 1.4 grams per liter were associated with an increased cardiovascular and increased all-cause mortality risk and we know that it's these data are significant because their confidence interval is completely above that red line which is the hazard ratio of one now note that at lower levels of apob for this age group there was no impact on mortality risk whether cardiovascular or all cause when able b was less than 1.23 grams per liter so from these data we can see that in 39 to 59 year olds relatively high april b is significantly associated with an increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk and this still supports that hypothesis that relatively lower april b may be better for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk in this relatively young age group but what about older than 59 years so that's we'll see here in 62 79 year olds and using the same setup first starting with the referent we can again see relatively higher levels of apob were significantly associated with an increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk and again both their confidence intervals are completely above that red line a hazard ratio of one so what about lower levels so we can see that there was no impact on cardiovascular mortality risk when april b was less than 1.23 grams per liter but notice that at the lowest level of apo b less than 1.06 grams per liter there was a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk so that argues against this idea that lower is always better for able b as we can see that relatively low apob for people in the 60 to 79 year age range was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk all right what about older than 79 so this study also provided that data with data for older than 80 years old which is what we can see here and again starting with the referent now we can see that relatively higher april b and lower april b was not significantly associated with mortality risk for or cardiovascular mortality risk for any level of april b but again notice at the lowest level of able b less than 1.06 grams per liter when compared with that red line the hazard ratio of one all cause mortality risk was significantly increased when in association with relatively low apob so collectively the data in 60 people older than 60 years shows that relatively lower it will be may not be better for all cause mortality risk in that age group so when people are older than 60 years so in terms of the initial premise of this video for able b is lower always better based on all cause mortality risk if you're older than 60 maybe not if you're 39 to 59 years that could be true all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing as mentioned in this video or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyfox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatron brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
