## Transcript

Hey welcome everyone today we've got luigi fontana who is a physician scientist and who is currently a professor of medicine and nutrition and is the leonard pman chair in transitional translational and metabolic health and is the director of the healthy longevity research and clinical program at the university of sydney australia luigi has auor authored dr fontana has authored 240 peer-reviewed papers that have been cited more than 30,000 times and just to put that in perspective for my mod you know modest academic career i've got about 4,000 citations so 7.5x more citations than me and two commercially available books including the path of longevity how to reach 100 with the health and stamina of a 40-year-old and the manual of health healthy longevity and well-being a three-step plan luigi also has a youtube channel and is active on social media and all those links will be in the video's description so with that welcome luigi hi mike thank you for having me all right so let's jump right in so i think what your most known for or i should say i think you're probably one of the most underrated scientists in longevity and aging i mean there are other popular names but for whatever reason the field just doesn't know about you as much and i think hopefully starting here will will start to change some mind so i think what you're most known for is cali restriction especially cali restriction studies in people so what can you tell us about your work on the calorie trial and some of the important findings and uh yeah what can you tell us about that well before starting the the calorie study for many years i've been studying the the cronies so basically these are members of the color restriction society some of these people they have been practicing color restriction for 14 years of course you know this is a cross-sectional study uh where we compared again these people that have been practicing color restriction without malnutrition for an average of 15 years with uh sex age and sex match endurance master athletes and uh and uh age and sex matched control sedentary controls eating consuming typical western dietes uh this study by itself has generated lots of publications that are complement complementary to the calorie study that instead of is a randomized clinical trial but in calor phase one uh we just we started people 50 to 60 years old overweight instead of in calorie phase 2 that was a multicenter study we study people between 20 and 50 years old so younger individuals with the idea with assumption that color restriction in animals has been studied in young animals than for for the rest of their life and uh bmi was between 22 and 28 so basically slightly overweight uh so basically again i've been stting to start color restriction in 2004 h with the studies on the cronies and then i we we we we follow up with calorie phase one and phase two and it's remarkable you know what we disc discovered because uh you know the assumption was does color restriction in humans ca the same metabolic molecular adaptations that we have noticed in in in in in animals in in in in rodents uh and the answer is yes with very few exceptions so wait all right so so let's backtrack so you started off cross-sectionally uh not uh looking not doing the rct which is the calorie study the current calorie study that's going on now and in the cross-sectional stud study where you looked at people who are on a calorie restricted but optimal nutrition diet you compared them against age match controls who are on a standard western diet and you saw improvements in the or differences between those two groups in terms of metabolic markers like uh glucose and lipids um so those yeah yeah it's like you know if you are comparing i don't know uh someone who's exercising is like if you are comparing the physiology of a master athlete with a sary person yes it's not an intervention study but you know immediately you know you can see that you know if you are studying someone who is running i don't know 80 kilometers per per per per per month his v2 max is going to be higher so there is no doubt about it you know and there is no doubt you know they going to be a better insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance they they're going to have less visual fat so uh we understand the limitation of a cross-sectional study however a 15 years long randomized clinical trial is impossible and again in the in in the cronies we have data on people that have a bmi much lower than those that we obtain so for example in calorie phase 2 as i said you know we started from population of 220 people with an age between 20 and 50 and bmi 2228 so on average the the basine bmi was 25 at the end of two years of color restriction the average bmi was 22.5 that is very far from the average bmi of 19.6 of the cronies nice so you mentioned that there were uh some so the animal studies were replicated are replicated in the cronies basically metabolically in lipids so with a few exceptions what were some of the exceptions in the human data versus the animal studies well the only the only exemption is igf1 so basically in the cronis we saw exactly the same hormonal adaptations with a reduction in t3 reduction in uh in in testosterone estrogens leptin increasing adiponectin increasing cortisol uh we saw an increase i haven't published thata yet you know but we we we we have data on a significant increase in n gf bp1 and bp2 but no change whatsoever in igf1 and that's been confirmed by the calorie study where we don't see a change we see a significant sustain increase in igfbp1 but no change in igf1 instead of one of the h marks of color restriction in rodents is the reduction the significant reduction in igf1 in in conjunction with an increased lifespan so lower igf-1 longer lifespan in rodents so that's that's an interesting uh you know observation because in people igf1 levels in youth in about 20 year olds is about 200 and then you know it declines during aging and then if you look at the meta analyses data it's um somewhere around you know 200 there's like a u-shaped curve too little being bad in terms of all cause mortality risk and also too high being you know bad in terms of uh increased risk too so would that favor you know the youthful lels do you want to make sure you don't go above 200 you know so what's your take because i know i've seen you talk about igf1 a lot and especially not seeing a difference in the cr group would that kind of invalidate as a potential marker of longevity in people or what's the optimal no no it's not like that you know the probably you know you know when you look at this data on igf1 testosterone d and other hormones that are typically pecking so basically when you are born you know you have very low igf1 or testosterone and then you know you peck around 18 20 years old and then there is a a decline the the the if you look at the standard deviation there is a huge difference among uh let's say normal people in ig in peak igf1 uh so 200 is just an average but there are people who have much lower and people who have much higher and and uh they are suggesting that the decline for example of testosterone is driven by disease so basically there are some studies in australia showing that if you if you remove people who have chronic conditions there is a a minor reduction in testosterone so possibly the the the the the reduction of igf1 that is linked with increased increased mortality is due to basic reverse causation so basically to the fact that you know for some reason as you accumulate molecular damage because you have overactivation of the insulin aan pathway and other hormonal pathways including testosterone estrogen other insulin basically these are all growth factors that are stimulating not only the p3 akm tor pathway is also stimulating the p66 shc pathway there are also being shown by um pelich to be linked you know with with longevity you accumulate more damage and so basically then you know this is causing a failure of the hypotheses to secrete growth hormone and therefore to stimulate igf1 so is a bit complicated but to make a long story short you know now we have plenty of evidence from multiple anim models you know dietary genetic and pharmacological witham iing that whenever you down regulate the insulin your quor pathway you extend lifespan and health span in in in animals so again uh the question is why in humans uh color restriction does not reduce igf1 so that's the the major question okay because you know again you know we see a an increase in igf bp1 bp2 and increase in c hormone binding globuline therefore we know that there is a reduced biovailability of igf1 testosterone estrogens are all playing a role in cancer in the most common type of cancer breast cancer prostate cancer colon cancer all of these hormones they are deeply implicated uh we as i said you know we we publish there is a significant increasing cortisol adiponectin high molecular adiponectin uh we saw a reduction in in as i said in leptin in t3 that is typical of color restriction and also of the dwarf longly to m so all the and it's amazing if you think about it you know these are the four major hypothalamus hypo hypothesis axis and a simple dietary intervention is able to marketly change all of them so basically you are regulating all the for apart from pactin that we didn't measure you are you are modulating all the major uh hypothesis hypothalamus hyp hypothesis axis that are reg major function of our organism with with a simple dietary intervention is is pretty amazing and then on top of that you know we saw major reduction inflammation cholesterol increase in hdl cholesterol improvement insulin sensitivity reduction in glucose at least pass in glucose and uh and then uh we perform biopsies of the scal mas colosa biops of these individuals and so we we we have shown that there is a a down regulation of the insulin aor pathway with an increasing foxo with sabatini at ling we we also mule discover there is a 30 to 50% reduction in phosphorilation of akt therefore there is a real downregulation of the inan pathway from a from a with a western block we we with go tamili we publish that there is a significant increase in hu proin 70 in beckling one lc3 so autophagy and and and and and chaperons like the ich protein 70 pathways that is important for misfolded proteins and with marco de maria we have shown that there is a a reduction in p16 and p21 inin 6 there are markers of of cells and essence so again i think you know with this cross-sectional study we really uh proven that you know both at the metabolic hormonal and molecular level there is a similar similar adaptations as we have demonstrated in long leave cr animals so that raises two issues one is okay so uh there is no age related decline for rf1 in the cronies cross-sectionally so one could argue no we don't know that we don't know we don't know that ah yeah yeah yeah okay sorry yes there is if you if you compare you know age by yeah there is no reduction a yes sorry sure yeah so with that in mind that one could argue that cr is better able to maintain you know or uh resist no no if if you want i'll tell you what i think it's happening so when you do color restriction in animals in reality the vine study are the study is you know they didn't uh reduce calories every day you know as you know basically uh first of all when you do calor restriction in animals you typically feed them once a day and so basically they fast for 20 22 hours 20 22 hours for a mice is probably like three days for a human being you know two days of fasting in mice is deadly so if you fast animals for more than two days you know all all strands of m they they die of starvation even you and me that you probably we have about a bmi around i have a bmi around 21 i can go for a month without eating a a mice can go mouse can go for for for two days maximum before dies of starvation so again one day 22 hours of of of of fasting is basically probably three four days of fasting in a human being and we know there are beautiful data in humans that you know with two days of fasting consecutive fasting you have a probably a 30% drop in igf1 and by day five you have a 50% reduction in igf1 so what i think and again you know the vine protocol was basically they were not only 30% color restriction but one of his post do that now is in japan i was in japan you know before coid he told me you know basically the protocol was that you know they were feeding 30% every other day so it was 30% plus every other day feeding so that was a massive fasting okay so what i think it happens that you know the reduction in ig1 in rod and we don't see humans in my people on calor restriction even they were severely calor restricted because the bmi of mean bmi of 19.6 it is because my people they were eating three times a day h instead of the the mice again they they are doing even if you are feeding them every day 30% less because they are they are very hungry they eat everything in a couple of hours and then they fast for 22 hours but again the classical protocol of vine dr it was every other day feeding so that was huge fasting for for rodents but could that limit human longevity if igf-1 plays a role in human longevity as it does in animal models that we would need to dramat even further reduce calories even for people on a cr diet and have very long and or long fasting periods no no no we have data you know we are now submitting for publication with some of these uh d dna mutilation clock uh suggesting that in those cronies who were overdoing calor restriction that had a bmi less than 19 the uh biological clock was aging faster so in those with a bmi higher than 19.6 you know they had a 2.5 years biological age younger but in those who were too severely color restricted there was an increase in in in biological age so uh i think you know we need to develop these biological clocks that is going to allow us to find tune what is the optimal caloric protein exercise whatever intake that is good for you because if i remember you know edward mazor i don't know if you met mazo i didn't meet him but he was the head of the department when i was in texas ed mao basically from if people that don't know was basically one of the basically pioneer of color restriction he was basically working mainly in in rats instead of vindr and um walford in m and i was he was a very good friend of mine and he told me you know basically that in some experiments he put rats on 60% calor restriction so they were eating only four 40% of of of at libitum calories and many of them they died of starvation but he told me the one who survived they were living very very very long lives again suggesting that even within inbred strain of rats or mice uh there is a something that we understand that basically it's it's a it's a it's a has a a peculiar are uh optimal caloric intake and if you're are overdoing calor restriction you are killing them and and as you know rafa de cabo has published you know this paper showing that you know if you take some of the strains that on 40% calor restriction they leave uh shorter then you put them on 20% now they leave longer because for those strains 40% is like 70% for other strains is is excessive and yet rafa told me that basically those animals who live shorter on 40% from a health point of view when they when they did the necros the autopsy they were perfectly healthy but it was too much so too much calor restriction but then you should be able to see that pattern of ill health you know systemically somehow so you know that makes me wonder what markers it maybe it's not glucose lipids igf-1 is it immune cells your you know your nutrifil go up lymphocytes go down like what oh probably probably you're starving aways like you know if you if if you do a you know let's do your doing fasting and and and you know and let's say you know i start to do fasting now and presumably healthy you know if if you know when i approach you know my 40 50 days of fasting even i'm super healthy i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going to die because you know basically you are in a starvation in a starvation situation and so probably this any anals on on on on on on like the mazo 60% rats or or these strains of mice on 40% basically you don't have enough energy to support you know the basic metabolis and so basically probably probably autophagy maybe you are killing yourself because you are digesting everything you can you know to produce enough energy to to keep going and that's what happens you know with prolonged fasting you know basically the body at the beginning is trying to slow down the destruction of muszle mass by using fat you know to produce ketone bodies but eventually when you get rid of the fat then you're going to start to use the the the the the muszle the heart you know all these and basically you're gonna fail yeah you are eating you are eating yourself you are eating eating yourself you know to produce energy for the crap cycle of all the even if you slow down metabolis by reducing t3 eventually once you get rid of all the body fat you know then you know you are muscle muscle yeah especially the respiratory muscle because if you're degrading respiratory muscles you just don't have the strength to breathe literally and respiratory and the heart you know probably and then you start to have you know problem maybe in your conductive system you know because you know you are starting to arthas yeah so then that gets to the question of what is the optimal cr potentially in humans right so and even then define it we don't know we don't know we need we we need to develop bi market yeah so what is you mentioned the beginning what is i will say disgusting out there there are a lot of people that they claim to be expert of longevity health and stuff like that and they they say a lot of stupid stuff you know i was the other day i was watching you youtube youtube video about you know i don't want to mention the neighbors and you know ah exercise the most powerful anti-aging intervention that you know we have no evidence whatsoever no evidence whatsoever you know john holl published several papers because he w he was convinced you know exsi was the the leading anti-aging exercise and he did several studies with hundreds of rats showing that basically exercise is increasing medium lifespan but only color restriction that animals who were weight paired you know with the exercise animal were living longer in terms of maximum lifespan not only average and maximum lifespan and and there are data just published on the european heart journal where they compared uh lifelong master athletes with uh people who were healthy but were moderately exercising and sedentary and basically the the long leave master athletes they had many more aos scerotic plaes in their coronary arteries with multiple uh coronary involved and significantly bigger ostic plugs and so this idea that exercise has an anti-aging effect is wrong h there is no data to support that so who claims that is because it's not knowledgeable enough uh and uh and again exercise is important we don't know exactly how much exercise i think you a lot of people out there they are overdoing exercise and there are now lots of data showing you know there is a u shape relationship if you're overdoing exercise you are and you know when i was working at washington university you know we we we studied people who were master athletes but they were consuming a typical american diet they were firmly convinced that you know exercise you know you you know you were like a like a oven where you know you were you were burning your calories and doesn't matter what type of calories you were putting in you know you were burning it and and and when we were putting these people on a treadmill you know it was in the older people it was a disaster you know you you your blood pressure was skyrocketing into 250 lots of arthas ventricular arthas you sometimes say you know let's stop it because you know if it's guy is's going to drop that you know then you know we're going to be in trouble and and and uh and and therefore this idea that you know you can eat it whatever you want and then you exercise and exercise the powerful anti-aging intervention again has no scientific evidence whatsoever so i agree 100% and i've gotten some uh push back from people in the youtube space because of those those comments the only caveat i would say is that uh as you mentioned you know the john's uh rat study where you get an increase in the median lifespan so there is some and even in in human data clearly there is a health span you know improvements as a result of regular exercise training but no no no don't get me wrong exercise is essential yes but so i'm just contesting that exercise by itself is longevity longevity and that exercise without proper nutrition or or even as this guy was mentioning that you know basically exercise the most powerful no exercise is not the most powerful but is essential is complementary in the right amount of endurance resistance flexibility posture you know so again longevity so when we do studies in animals humans we are forced you know to study one intervention at once you know because we want to understand what is doing what but in reality longevity healthy longevity is a combination of multiple factors it's like you know if you say what is the most important part of a car i don't know the the the the cylinders so you know the the regular easy thinking is okay if the pistons are the cylinders are important let's have 20 cylinders let's have 20 wheels let's have 20 whatever no an an efficient car has to have the right amount amount of uh cylinders and wheels and whatever you know to be efficient you know by having many more you know you're not making a ferrari you're making i don't know an inefficient car and so that's what we are trying to do in science to understand what is doing what how much important and and and what is the right amount and so far unfortunately as i said you know we don't have biomarkers of optimal energy intake of optimal protein intake of optimal essential like pranin amino acids or sulfur amino you know we know are extremely important for longevity we don't have you know biomarker that is telling us if we are exceeding in exercise there is an interesting paper published in cell metabolis last year showing that you know when you overdoing exercise there is an impairment in glucose tolerance for example therefore maybe a cg m could be a way you know to monitor if you are overdoing exercise because that in that impairment in glucose tolerance was linked you know with the impairment in mitochondria function yeah so just so just just to reiterate exercise is essential to the process but the idea that you're going to get to maximum longevity or beyond there's no data that supports that not in animal models not in human and i came across a study where it was a 40-year longitudinal study and this supports the hypothesis that people with a median age of about 55 at baseline that had exercise you know that moderate to vigorous exercise is a part of their approach had it increased odds of getting to 95 but 95 was basically the upper limit so you're basically enhancing your ability to get past the average lifespan but there's there's some so which raises the issue there's something simultaneously good about exercise to improve median lifespan you know and uh quality of life and all these things but then simultaneously bad that it limits your ability to get to the maximum which goes into potentially exercise dose as you mentioned most people probably overtrained and overdoing it right so i think one great way to look at apart from that you know apart from that you know because we have been studying people who are exercisers you know we don't see uh basically the increas in cortisol we don't see the reduction in t3 uh we don't see the reduction in igf1 of course so there are many of these important hormonal adaptation you know we were discussing before that they don't they are not triggered by exercise and if anything exercise increasing testosterone is increasing uh igf1 special resistant exercise so that's the problem you know you know exercise is essential because you know with exercise it's a massive improvement insulin sensitivity uh more than more than calor restriction exercise more power than calor restriction improving en sensitivity we have we have published that you know in in a couple of papers uh exercise does increase hdl colesterol like cr but probably more powerful reduction in triglyceride inflammation i don't think you know is as powerful has scal restriction blood pressure the acute effect of exercise yes but you know we have data showing that as you get older if you are on a typical american diet you know you get hypertension even if you are are uh exercising constantly instead of calor restriction the effects of on calor restriction with optimal nutrition not with malnutrition on on blood pressure is amazing you know you know the people on on cr with optimal nutrition had a blood pressure of 100 over 60 even when they were 70 years old uh so again there are certain metabolic adaptations that are typical of cr and others that are typical of ex excise like like the glute for or or the bdnf and other ones you know they are peculiar of exercise that are essential as we discussed for health spain but there are others that are not triggered by exercise that they they don't and that's why you know basically it doesn't doesn't slow down aging because it doesn't trigger some of these important adaptations which then gets the issue of dose like how much exercise and what magnitude of calor restriction to get to the maximum and even beyond the maximum right so so i think i think i so i track uh heart rate variability and resting heart rate and knowing that heart rate variability declines during aging and the resting heart rate increases up until about 50 and then declines knowing that data um you can well at least i do i titr trate my workouts so that i'm not overtrained whereas when i started on this journey five years ago those data looked chronically overtrained and most most people think more is better which again goes into that beginning of the you know the the u-shape curve so another aspect too is is the master's athletes even though they're you know obviously their fitness is elite you know cardiovascularly um most people even in you know endurance athletes you would think they'd want to be you know put the best fuel in their engine you know it's like pizza and cookies and cakes which goes to your point about i'm i'm exercising so i'm burning it off yeah but what are you doing systemically by eating a suboptimal nutrient you know poor diet right so that could be some of the the reason why there's only about a threeyear increase uh for absolutely absolutely you know we i don't have you know strong data but you know in in the people who have been studying uh that were master athletes at wu you know i think you know i could see a a like a like a phenotype metabolic phenotype of those few people who were exercising but eating a healthy diet compared to the great majority that as we discuss you know they thought you know they could they whatever they wanted because the mcdonal whatever they wanted because basically they were exercising a lot of hours and so they said okay you know i'm i'm i'm i'm running 80 miles per per week therefore then i can eat whatever i want and and uh and uh and then you know we know that you know when you are overdoing exercise because you are constantly stimulating the cam energic pathway that is also very important for longevity ac5 knockout animals leave longer an ac5 is the transactional pathway for a camine signaling so this constant uh exposure to high catamin is causing fibrosis you know there are lots of data showing that basically when you are overdoing color exercise endurance exercise basically you are causing fibrosis in the heart and that's why you know i was telling you some of these people were testing for v2 max these master old the master ad you know they had all these ventricular arritmias because basically these patchy fibrosis of the heart if if it basically hits you know the conductive system then you know it's causing these dangerous potentially lethal arrythmias so and plus the joints a lot of people were studying you know when they were 50 60 a lot of them had to have joint replacement you know hip or or or or knee replacement because you know if you you if you're running running running running on the on these joints especially with a bad diet your cartilage and your bone they are aware of and and eventually these people they have to stop running or they have to use uh you know put you know replacement you know hip replacement or or knee replacement so what what what would you recommend as a dose in terms of calories calorie restriction and then even exercise so to maximize health span and longevity again we don't know so i think you know the the best is to avoid increasing wasted conference yeah so you to what i'm trying to do is to now i'm 54 and i'm trying you know basically to to to keep my abdominal fat you know my visual fat as low as possible you know by combining regular exercise but not excessive exercise with with a healthy diet where you know you control calories at least i control calories by by eating high quality high fiber high fiber food you know so you know it's without becoming extreme because again not knowing what is optimal caloric intake you know again some of the cronies that like the exercisers were thinking that you the more the better this new data you know we have we're going to submit for publication soon using the dna mutilation clocks they show you know this people people they they they are killing themselves so basically they're getting older than you know so they are trying to minimize caloric intake you know at a almost phobic uh manner and the result is not more longevity but is less longevity so for the time being not having reliable biomarkers you have to be moderate yeah so along those lines i there are multiple biomarkers that you can measure and i you frequently post your blood pressure you know it's almost always 100 over 60 your resting heart rate is like 46 or maybe it's even lower that's just what i remember so at least monitoring blood pressure glucose lipids that would be a good start to know that you're on the right track assuming that they would start to go haywire if you were cutting calories too low and in you know your duration and frequency of exercise was too much and you know having a fasting glucose less than around 85 80 85 milligram deciliter a lot of people l they get older you know they have a steady in increase in in in fasting glucose is 85 90 95 9 99 100 and then it goes you know in the pre-diabetes range uh and you you need people need to understand that you know well before your your glucose goes from 85 to to 90 995 you have compensatory hyper insulin anemia so the first thing happens is insul resistance so basically you get insul resistant and then you know your glucose is start to climb you know and and and uh probably so as clinician say you know typically when you have someone with a diagnosis of type two diabetes probably it has been for 10 15 years in with diabetes or pre-diabetes and i think you know this guy has been for 25 30 years with insulin resistance now you have to think about it you know as i said you know the insulin a one pathway is one of the most important pathway for regulating aging there is lots of data support in that so because most people they are always in a post pandal status because they wake up in the morning they start to eat and then they keep eating all day long you know chocolate and this and drink you know they always have you know this cup of soda in their hand hands you know so they are always in a post pandal state and therefore typically for example the master athl and the cronis they in the fasting state they had two micro units of insulin per ml okay so of most people most normal people without you know diabetes they have you know aid so it's like basically four folds higher than uh than uh the the the chonies or the master athletes that's in the fasting state but when these people they start to eat their their their insulin goes to 100 150 micro units and so you have to think about you know these the cells of these human beings they are constantly bombarded the insulin receptor of these people they are constantly bombarded with this huge amount of insulin so this is like to be exposed you know to a constant it's like smoking cigarettes you know because because as i said you know if you have you know this uh constant binding of the insulin to the insulin receptor in these big ways you know basically you have a constant activation of the pa3 pathway and therefore you have a inhibition of poxo translocation with an inhibition of autophagy with an inhibition of dna repair pathways with an inhibition of antioxidant pathways like catales and and so to and with the massive activation of cycling d1 d2 d3 so basically you have more cell proliferation and when you have more cell proliferation you have more random mutations if these random mutation they are hitting the enogen you have cancer if they are hitting the non onogen you have cells inessence so basically you have to imagine basically like you know this having this constant hyperinsulinemia that translates into a reduction in igf bp1 bp2 and stomo binding globine with an increased exposure to igf1 testosterone estrogens that are massively driving cancer and they are massively driving basically these accumulation of molecular damage because you are th regulating the autophagy dna repair antioxidant cellular pathways and so people that don't realize that yes smoking getting exposed to smoking is bad and the more cigarettes you're smoking the more risk the more damage you are causing being exposed to alcohol and other you know of these uh stupid you know marketing idea is that you know alcohol is good you know because you have resveratrol alcohol get metabolize into aetate and calate is a cancer molecule today there was a paper that i just posted in my youtube channel showing it was in resus monkeys so basically exposure chronic exposure to alcohol intake caused basically a damage of the mop poesis with an increase in monocytes and and and and mcroof phages and a proin massive pro-inflammatory effect that lasted for one month so basically after you know the there was an abstinence for one month and one month of abstinence still there was a pro-inflammatory effect on top of you know the risk of cancer induced by again acetal and and and and other diseases so but i think hyperinsulinemia is even more powerful than these two factors adding a little bit yeah 100% agree the other side to that story where you know people's glucose levels could be a constant and as you're mentioning they have hyperinsulinemia the other aspect of that is chronic hyper hyperinsulinemia eventually you'll have beta cell failure where now insulin levels drop and then you'll start to see that glucose age related or an exacerbation of that glucose related rise so uh measuring insulin is important but um seeing that your glucose levels are rising during aging definitely not a good thing uh you know so but but that's again 10 15 years when you start to see your glucose raising you are 10 15 years uh of overe exposure to elevated insulin definitely yeah all right so in terms of the alcohol so just going to that so the med is not as important in you know basically what's his name i forgot his [music] name carter forgot now i have a laps but anyway so basically he did a study where he created some animals that were glute for expressor over expressor so so so he compared basically al libitum fed wild animals with al libitum fed glute for over expressors and and then both of these on color restriction and what he found that you know basically glute four over expressor that you know had 24-hour lower glucose did not live longer but both the uh control wild type and the glucose glucose ov expressor on color restriction they longer and so these data are suggesting that glucose by itself is not the driver of aging but again is because in this case glute over expressor was not really caused by ins resistance instead of is the hyperinsulinemia the insulin resistant that precedes glucose that is causing of course high glucose levels are causing glycation of proteins with the and the glycation of of proteins is causing damage to the artery to the heart to the kidney we know that but it's that's a different that's not touching the primary aging the the accumulation of molecular this is kind of disease related the increasing glucose so what i think it happens is that it's not really the glucose that is the major determinant of aging but is the many years of compensatory hyperinsulinemia and higher igf1 bi ability that is the main driver together with many other factors you know of aging so there's human data that supports that too there's a study in people who are 85 to supercentenarian status so older than 110 and when looking at all cause mortality risk hdl ldl hba1c is a marker of glycemia not associated with an increased all cause mortality risk within that age group right essentially we're looking at longevity but albumen so higher relative levels of albumen lower crp p and lower creatinine is a marker of kidney function associated with all cause mortality ris so higher alamin lower crp and lower creatin which suggests inflammation uh potentially liver function andor inflammation for albumin and uh and kidney function right as as drivers but all right so um so the alcohol story is an interesting one and uh so i i agree and in part because it messes with my uh sleep and uh quality of life you know next day hangover it feels terrible even small amounts so i haven't had an alcohol for a long time 10 years maybe but um it the mediterranean diet you know that's a big thing you know and granted the mediterranean diet i i still have huge issues with it because compared to the the typical american western diet it's which is terrible a mediterranean diet probably better but the red wine is promoted as a big part of the mediterranean diet so what are your thoughts but that's but that but that's not true i mean these is like shortcuts you know you know these are again you know marketing marketing ideas you know my my my my my my parents you know my mom is from south italy she was born in south italy so back then people they didn't have money you know to to buy wine and drink wine regularly so you know yes maybe you know they they were they had you know maybe i don't know 10 bottles of wine per year you know where they were drinking you know during the festivities you know glass of wine you know but it was not you know they were drinking wine at lunch and dinner you know that's not the case it's like you know the story of ok now they were eating a lot of fish it's not true when i went to okinawa to see the centenarians with with craig wilcox basically i've been talking with some of these nonagenarians and back then fish was consuming you know maybe couple of times per week you know so the rest was basically the sweet potatoes with a lot of tofu and vegetables and some fruits and and some nuts you know so there is a lot of um marketing strategies propaganda about the mediterranean diet so the classical mediterranean diet was basically i can tell you because that's what my grandmother was telling me it was basically whole homemade uh bread and pasta so they had you know the dum wheat you know from southe is fantastic you know it was basically m fresh with the german everything and then they were doing basically the bread and the pasta with chickpeas lenol there was a lot of vegetables fresh vegetables some fruit uh some nuts you know some fish you know but it was m mostly sardines and these small fish you know they were preparing for all year long you know with spicy tom spicy pepper and um fantastic you know then you know they had all these uh eggplants and pepper and tomato sauce you know from organic tomatoes so fantastic stuff so basically it was mainly a plant-based diet with some eggs from basically chicken that they had you know in their in their garden and and and and some cheese mozzarella and some cheese and probably they were eating meat twice a month you know and uh and that's the d the real mediterranean diet has nothing to do with the mediterranean die nowadays you know it's nothing to do which also another i think overhyped and maybe we'll disagree here i don't know but olive oil is another one that's overhyped and i think when you think about olive oil most of the data is not compared against the whole food olives like if you had a quote unquote mediterranean diet or any diet and you fed an equivalent amount of calories from olives versus olive oil i don't think olive olive oil would win so what are your thoughts on olive oil as a part of or in in amounts or again again olive oil you know back then it was basically a family maybe they were having like one liter per month for a family very little so yes it was a very small amount you know they didn't have liters and liters and liters of olive oil right right like now people that are using you know one tablespoon of olive oil is 120 calories so if you're using too much olive oil you know easily you put 700 800 calories of pure oil in your diet that by the way even if it's mostly mons saturated fatty acids there is a a a percentage of saturated fatty a is that you know it adds up you know at the end of the day so if you're consuming a lot of olive oil because you're are dressing everything with olive oil you have an excess calories and you have an excess of saturated fatty acids and if you have an excess calories you're going to gain viseral fat and because you're going to gain viseral fat you're going to become ins resistant you're going to have hyperinsulinemia you're going to have inflammation you're going to have you know this lipidemia all this stuff so i mean again a small amount of olive oil is okay but it's a small amount it's not you know the more the better yeah no doubt alcohol meat very rarely classic mediterranean diet some of that is in your book that and the exercise versus cr in terms of longevity for people who who want to check it out so the other thing i want to ask about is so in one of your books you wrote that death is unavoidable so what are your thoughts yeah yeah i still believe you know that that's an is is unavoidable because first of all let's say you know you know i don't think so but you know let's say you know that you know we're going to find like you know ab gray suggest you know ne negligible death so we already eight billion people on this planet without people dying you know we're going to quickly become 30 40 50 billion is impossible there is not enough food on on this planet you know we're going to kill each other there is no doubt about you know there is you know we are already at the limit you know i think you know there are data suggesting that you know we already consuming more than twice you know the resources that is on this planet especially because a lot of people now in china everywhere they started to consume red meat or other meat you know like you know we in western countries do and so you know we are burning the amazon you know to produce meat you know for for china and uh so it's it's a disaster that's part of the problem i don't know if you have been watching today i was watching you know the m major tyon in greece you know there basically there is a third of the of of greece underwater you know of the land of greece underwater in in hong kong there's been a tyho that has been basically hong kong was underwater you know is a disaster you know there is it's and there are fires everywhere and so definitely you know there is something that it's strange even if you don't believe in global warming these extreme events and people they don't realize that you know let's say in greece now onethird of the uh arable land is underwater so basically the crops they're going to fail when food is going to become scars you know because you know with roads and and and and and flooding you know basically you don't have enough food to feed the people people they're going to start to kill themselves you know because when when there is no food you know people they're going to take the gun and they're going to go and get the food where they can so people they don't realize what's going on and so they think about you know negligible aging when there are most more important so as you know in my books you know i'm talking about philosophy because i think you know one of the problem of our society you know you know we have completely missed the connection with our spiritual life with nature with you know the real meaning of life and you know if you study philosophy at least certain type of philosophy you understand you know the beauty of life and the beauty of being on this journey in life and when you are dying basically you're just moving into other energy and other life you know there is no that you know everything is is in circle so you know the the idea that you are dying is just a misconception of what's going on in the universe you're just basically right now an aggregation of atoms like you know if you take you know water you know if it's cold you know the water is going to become ice and depending where you know the i the water was located you know going to have a certain shape and then eventually when the temperatures increase you're going to become water and maybe water vapor but you're still water you're still ag2 h2 oh okay and so i think you know this journey is a beautiful journey what we should do is to optimize our health to be in in harmony with the laws of nature where you know for example i was on a on a major documentary last last you know on on wednesday the italian tv basically when i was in italy now this summer the the italian tv producer duo jamaria basically he came to interview me in different part of italy but interesting there is this professor that is called sylvio garattini who was the head of the mario pharmacological institute 94 still working in the institute no disease no medication perfectly brilliant every day he walked 6 kilometers high speed he drive his car 94 4 years old so that's what we need to achieve you know basically you know having a long healthy life where you can still at 94 is still you know mentally capable of going to work and being engaged in what other young people are doing and you know with his wise uh attitude you know he can help you know people to so that's what i think is important you know this obsession with a longer life doesn't at least for me is not important so for you it's it's getting to the oldest age you possibly can in as good of health as you can and getting beyond the 120 years not so important because population size are get too big people start killing each other it's a it's a madness that's that's where you're on maybe 120 130 we based on the monkey study sherman basically if we if we if we assume that you know the average lifespan of of a monkey is 26 and the average lifespan of a man right now is 80 so sherman leave 44 years this is like 135 years of a human being so it is possible that you know some human beings could live to 140 it's possible but beyond that no interest death is unavoidable there's no way beyond well beyond that you know it's possible you know you know with some technology you can make it maybe i don't know i'm just now 200 but past that you know the fact you know all these human beings they're going to leave forever is impossible for the planet there is no way that you know 20 30 billion people can live on this planet there is not enough food i i agree with that what uh can help get around that is if your lifespan is now 200 years or longer or some amount beyond 120 now you've got an extra time period to learn other stuff to potentially potentially get you off this rock now maybe this planet becomes too overcrowded but if you've got a hundred years to study you know aerospace engineering and quantum physics and all these things that may be linked with interstellar travel this is beyond the philosophy i guess you know that's where i see it look look anything look anything is possible you know if you think you know you know what we achieved right now know right now basically we are on zoom you are in us i'm in australia and we are discussing a recording if if uh caesar julius caesar you know you were asking should do you think you know that in in in 100 years or 1,000 years is going to be possible to to to talk you know via internet you know say are you crazy so everything is possible based on what we know right now if there is another planet like planet earth is so far that there is no way you know we can reach it you know with mod modern technology yeah but then the question is but then the question is how long do you need to live where science is caught up to get around that problem of it's just too far away and using conventional methods and bending space time and now i'm right now i'm more concerned on on my concern right now on this planet that is under under attack you know if if the the you know people that don't realize that you know this is just the starting you know this this massive flooding and fires and stuff like that you know that are happening more frequently and more frequently is just the beginning again if this trend is real the problem is not going to go like a hurricane that is going to destroy your house is failure of crops in greece right now onethird under waterer of the land is underwat so for a year no food you know there is a third less food so probably because you know we are interconnected they can import some food you know from from from somewhere else but if if this you know massive increase in flooding you know is becoming is exceeding then you know there is not going to be enough food so that's i think you know what where now right now as human being you know we should concentrate our energy you know to say okay you know what can we do to create a a a a world where you know we protect the environment we create a world you know where there is no war you know where we live you know in in a constructive way we use all the technology we have you know to create you know energy efficient houses and cars and everything so you know we don't we are not polluting where you know basically you don't have to fight you know for oil because you don't need oil anymore because you you know you can extract energy for the sun the wind the geothermal and everything where you know instead of having millions of people who are sick healthare system are unsustainable in us right now uh we are spending you are spending and not anymore me but you are spending basically i think in 2013 it was uh 3.2 trillion dollar in 2021 it was $4.1 trillion doll so basically in 10 years you know it's almost $1 trillion increase with a 2.5 years decrease in lifespan expectancy in the last three four years you have a massive epidemic of obesity you know 40% obese individual 30% overweight you know metabolic syndrome is a disaster so you are spending 4 trillion plus four four more than four trillion with shitty results and uh and uh and this is unsustainable even even here even in in in italy because you know this idea that you know you are treating disease once they have occurred to me is like to say you know i buy a new car a new ferrari and then i i have no idea when i have to change the oil the tires the brake pads and so i said you know i don't care so most people said i don't care you know i want to live my life without any problem i want to eat whatever i want i want to drink i don't care yes you know you can do the same with your car you know you can buy an inexpensive ferrari and say i don't care i'm not going to change the oil i don't care i don't i'm not going to change the the the the the tires and the brake pads you know what happens you know probably when 15,000 k the car is is is dead or you're going to have an accident yes you can do it but it's unsustainable for for the planet you know because you know for the for the economies because unless and so it's crazy what what what most people are thinking instead of you know we have the knowledge to have many people living like artini 94 without diseases without medications you can free trillions of dollars from healthare to spend in uh technology science and maybe yes to advanc health span and and lifespan so the do you think that so this gets to the issue of the individual versus the collective and in it's i i i don't like to be a pessimist i'm generally an optimist i i'm not negative i try to stay towards the positive but i'm generally not bullish on uh global society changing climate change anytime soon i think there's too much money invested in the people who are in the old school thought of coal and all the other things that pollute the environment and too much meat whatever it may be so we oh no i'm positive i think you know you know that in the in the next couple of years we're going to start to see uh these major events like you know now um hong kong hong kong is basically carbon neutral no but it's super advanced you know so you know basically it's under water you know there is a it's there is a a major destruction and so if you start to see new york or major you know london or rome or major towns you know underwater or with major failure then i think you know they're going to act and we have the technology and the knowledge you know to quickly you know change gear and uh and and and and reduce pollution very quickly so i think you know we still have they're going to be damage but i think you know once you know people and politician they're going to start to because right now you know there are a lot of people say ah that's not true there is no global warming it's just you know normal fluctuation you know it happens you know there is you know this up and down of you know yes that's true but you know the frequency now is so frequent and so extreme that you know cannot be just normal fluctuation it's something more and so i think you know in the next couple of years it's not going to take long you know a couple of years if you're going to start to see major problems you know when you know you have major cities uh that are underwater with you know a lot of people dying and stuff like that i think you know they're gonna change so just to play the just to play the pessimist role again unfortunately so here in the states you know there's a big problem with gun violence even like pre you know schools getting little kids getting murdered you know so they can't even pass legislation or don't want to for background checks things that you would assume would reduce gun violence tremendously right so for something as you know localized as that when compared with the environment you know can't pass laws to you know have moderate gun control and i'm not talking about taking away people's guns but you are the only country because for example in australia here there was like i don't know 15 20 years ago a massive shooting and then you know basically the government say okay that's it so they bought all the guns and right now there is nobody with a gun here in australia you know you mean the average people doesn't have a gun you know and in ital in my country basically that nobody has a gun unless you know you go to the you say when you to the shooting shooting range shooting and and and and you have to have a special permit from the police and you have to tell the police and going from home to here if the police is you it it blocks you you know away from this path you're going to be in jail yeah but here there's like so many people that are against that it's like taking i mean think it's it's a decades long problem hasn't been fixed us has to change us us has to change in many aspects you know i think you know you under you are under the spell of these major lobbyist who are basically brainwashing people people and uh for money for the for money literally they don't understand you know they're eating crap you know they they are they have guns you know they they have they have addiction with opioid with anything you know weat it's a it's a society that went too far in a materialistic way and the consequences are awful for metabolic mental health spiritual health is gone it's gone everything everything has to be rebuilt you know has to be rebuilt from scratch so is part of the answer just moving to a farm self-sufficiency don't you know where you can take care of yourself right if everybody's got that self-determinism to take care of their own health it kind of gets beyond the societal you know uh sick care and and pollution right is is going off grid part of the solution is that i don't know so you you went from the state you went italy to states and then to australia so was that yeah was that part of the thought proc i don't know if it was but um no look you know i i i i i went i arrived in 2001 in in in in in in us at washington university because i was interested uh in in color restriction so when i was studying medicine i remember you know this professor bosello who came to one of the lectures and he was talking about color restriction in animals and said wow so there is an intervention in mammals that is able to extend lipan and hell span my gosh that's fantastic so there is something real and so basically then you know one once i finished my resid in internal medicine i started my phd in metabolis i started to look around and i said you know who is working on color restriction in humans so i wrote to richard v i said you know look you know i'm working on annuals but there is john hollosy who just got an nih grant calorie grant to study color restriction why don't you write to him so i wrote to john and john said you know fantastic come to work with me so i took my lage and i i i moved to to st louis and i work with john for 18 years then you know once i was at the end of john retired you know then he got sick and then i said you know what should i do and uh i started to there were some friends who were basically close to bloomberg and bloomberg basically was poten ially interested to fund a longevity center was sho but the dean and you know we talk with the dean he was not interested and so i said yes okay i understand you know this is a model based on disease so basically the more sick people you have the more money you do that's the the american model you know because that doesn't exist in public health care so basically this private hospital you know if you have a department of cardiology you want to have a lot of sick people or because you know the more you cardiac surgery you do the more spent you put the more money you do and the more budget you have for your department and so i said okay that's enough enough of us john basically he was in a in a nursing home and i said you know it's time for a change and so i had an offer to go to work for singapore germany london and sydney and then at the end of the story because i think you know quality of life is important i move to sydney because here the quality of life is fantastic very little pollution high quality food you know in sydney is the weather is fantastic beautiful beaches beautiful nature and so i said you know why not let me go to sydney and enjoy the nice weather the nice low pollution low crime zero crime here you know i can leave my we leave our door open you know nobody's touching you so instead of when i was leaving st louis morning and evening you were say okay now i'm going to call the security to go to work or not so so all right so then that was great so how that was how basically you got into aging and the and the the path that where you are now so then going forward i think i saw you have a a study on atherosclerosis and and reversing atherosclerosis but current studies and then future projects future goals where do you where do you stand there no we have several studies one is on combination of diet five to pes vegetarian diet and exercise and some uh meditation you know to see if we can reverse atherosclerosis by ct scan and the in the arosc pla and we also do a stress mri to see if we can change microcirculation the heart plus you know all the metabolomics proteomics gut microbiome fmd and many other measurements then you know we have a study on the effects of fasting with ketogenic diet in in patient with acute mal leukemia to see if we can basically protect the normal cells from the damage of chemotherapy in humans in aml we are just starting a study on uh three days of fasting with without exercise to see if we can increase autophagy because there are no data in humans about autophagy lot of people they again a lot of propaganda they not fasting is inducing autophagy but there is no single paper showing that in humans there is an increasing autophagy flux so now we are we are starting a study to see you know if three days of fasting water only fasting plus exercise plus or minus exercise can induce autophagy dna repair and other other pathways plus you know we just started i'm i'm i'm i have you know beginning of the year i i i've been promoted as the scientific director of the char bing center rpa clinic and so uh i've now i i got some philanthropy money to hire a chefing residence an exercise physiologist a resident and the hospital just approved you know the these lifestyle medicine clinical service so now we have a healthy for life program with a clinical service on lifestyle medicine another one on education in schools in we are now doing workshops in high school uh the idea is this one that you know a lot of colleagues of mine know i say you know you have the lipid clinic you have the obesity clinic you have the fatty li disease clinic the breast cancer oncology clinic typically so if someone comes to you with hyper cholesterol inia you're going to give a statins of the p69 p6 pcs9 k inhibitor and that's it but as we said you know these people they have hyperinsulinemia stress inflammation that are not pharmacological treated so the idea is that you know these people that are taking the medication for lowering cholesterol then they're going to come to our lifestyle med medicine clinical service where with a chef they're going to learn how to cook healthy tasty food uh and the exercise physiologist that is not just exercising a couple of days per week because you know people they say you know the exercise for example does not reduce body weight yes because people they exercising two three times per week we john you know in calorie phase one we have shown that you know you can achieve 8% weight loss with exercise only but to achieve 8% weight loss and 40% reduction in viseral fat by mri with exercise only you have to exercise one hour a day six days a week at 72% of max art rate without changing calories without changing your calories changing without changing calories if you exercise one day a week six days a week one hour per per session at between 60 and 80% on average 72% of max r rate you burn 40% of viseral fed in one year but that's an overweight overweight people or where 50 to 60 years old men and women bmi 25 5 to 30 at baseline yeah so for people who had a lean have a lean bmi closer to the 22 is uh range that would probably be too much right i mean if uh they probably have less v the yeah yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely so longevity clinic focusing on nutrition educating on nutrition and exercise yeah in in a mechanistic way so you know you can it's not just you know eat you know mediterranean that you know there are certain parameters you know you can measure and see if your intervention is basically inducing the metabolic molecular changes that we know are important in regulating the accumulation of metabolic molecular aging based on all the stud you know that you know we have been discussing or at least you know some of those we have been discussing of course you know the the in the future if i have more money i would like to hire someone who is going to help us you know to do some mental emotional health reframing because i think you know one of the reason why people they are not change the lifestyle because they don't have you know the right mind frame and so i think you know we need to work on that in a more systematic way we are also developing a e platform ealth platform with an app you know where they have an app you know that is helping us you know to monitor then you know in the future we can link you know the cgm and other sensors so basically where you know you can monitor how your intervention on you not on a group is going to change you know what you're doing how much is going to change your glucose and eventually we're going to develop other sensors to measure you know maybe some some amino acids you know 24 hour a day and um yeah so that's because i'm convinced that uh unless we are going to incorporate these new mod model of lifestyle medicine clinical service into primary practice there is no we're not going to change it's going to be unsustainable so my idea is that in the future you know you have you have you know maybe 20 gp you have you have a clinic of 20 gps at the center you have basically the metab the chef in residence with with the exercise physiology maybe one of these you know mindfulness whatever emotional health you know a health professional and so as you as as a doctor you say okay this is the medication for your blood pressure for your glucose whatever however i strongly suggest you know you're going to do some workshops you know with these people to improve your overall metabolic health and eventually based on the that we have you're going to go off medications nice and plus it could be a small scale model of what we can replicate you know on a society on a soci society wide you know to to reduce the sick care you know and flip it into the right now if i have to tell you this is my main interest right now because i think you know we know enough we have enough knowledge mechanistic knowledge to prevent 90% of the chronic disease we see in our hospital and if we prevent 90% of the disease we have in hospital we can free so much money to invest in research to advance what we were telling you to develop biomarkers you know to measure optimal calorie intake exercise stuff like that and potentially you know to uh extend even further health span and lifespan so you know maybe to to get you know to your real max so the other side of that is uh you know beyond the big food companies and big pharma who stand the profit as you mentioned from everybody being sick and overweight and unhealthy the the mindset and the you know behavioral aspect of it is important too because like you said there maybe a maybe half the population i know some large number that likes eating their chips and cookies and cheeseburgers and that would never adopt a quote unquote healthy lifestyle because to them being alive means i'm going to do whatever i want and eat whatever i want raising the cost for all of us so it's almost like we have to go to war with that seg segment of the population who is making it bad for all of us in terms of healthcare costs and you know filling up the hospitals it's a tough battle right yeah but it's educational again you know apart from this as i said you know one is this lifestyle clinical medical service and the other one is basically the concept you know that i try to summarize in my book the life the the the path of longevity should become mandatory teaching starting in primary school so you know you should have my book made simple for for for for for for uh primary school students and so one hour per week like you teach math and gram and history one one hour per week you should teach them you know they should start to understand you know all this concept you know then you know in in second in high school you you're going to become more sophisticated and then in in university even if you're are not a doctor but if you are a lawyer if you are an economist you should have you know like an exam on this topics is mandatory this is going to transform society because you know this concept they're going to become so ingrained that you know you're going to move the the gaussian curve on the right and then you know basically the new the new generation of journalist public officer economist engineer doctors they have this mentality and therefore basically people that are going to be like again c youtini 95 years old no medication no uh no impairment no disease still active mentally physically that's a che he not genetically lucky this guy this guy has been doing moderate color restriction uh with optimal nutrition exercise all his life all right so yeah i totally agree that's the way it should be from starting young right so they're learning the right way nutrition isn't taught in schools here at all it's so it's and then they grow up you know lunchtime is chips and the soda so it's ingrained for the duration of their life and then anyone who's outside of that box eating a real food diet is the why are you eating healthy like what this is real food what are why are you eating unhealth right so we need to flip that mindset so that's a a great absolutely and then you have also to flip the mindset you know you know eating healthy is unt tasty you know eating healthy is tasty yeah when when rarely i need to go to the restaurant when i go back home for a couple of days i feel shitty yeah so that's a that's a great point because i don't know if you remember and i think i mentioned to this to you in uh message but when we went to dinner you me holly arand back in the day when i was a grad student that was when i was uh in the gym a lot more protein intake probably close to double what it is now and you said to me you said you're too heavy you're just too big and i was only 170 pounds 5 fo7 so now it's funny because you said you know my bmi you 21 and a half so my current body weight 141 this morning so about 64 kilos and still still have the muscle so or some not as much so uh it took me a while to get on that path but i'm grateful that you you you know were honest honest enough to tell me tell me the truth so all right is there anything we didn't cover that we should we should uh oh i think you know i think you know we we we we we we we we had a nice discussion of over an overview of again look you know we acquire so much knowledge of course there is a much more you know we have to learn as i said you know but you know we already have enough knowledge you know to prevent in most people or to marketly reducing most people the development of 90% of the most common chronic disease we we see in our hospital we can massively increase the probability of someone to live a long and healthy life without medications it's really possible it's possible this needs you know to [music] become a crucial topic not only medical schools but in every school in in society and we have to re frame you know our educational health care system that right now is a sick care system and an educational system and is not really targeted you know to health human and environmental health and flourishing and again you know we we need you know to to to to talk about it and as as you said you know it's it's amazing you know i wrote you know a couple of books that you know they sold you know the a number of copies but nothing compared you know to a lot of stupid books out there you know that are totally wrong you know they they got it wrong you know easy fix you know the five to died and you know the keto died the paleo died you know the atkin died millions of copies of books you know that are increasing mortality and and disease and uh and they got it wrong it's completely wrong you know it's a it's a easy fix uh that people love you know give me one simple thing you know but i don't want to change more than that so i your your current book may or books maybe not you know as as high as you want but i'd say don't give up there the cream always rises to the top it's only a matter look you know i'm not concerned you know it's just a consideration look you know i wrote this book because i thought you know look you know after all these years of uh salaries paid as a professor from basically public money because in in us my salary was paid by nih funding and here is paid by the by by the government in italy as well i think you know as as an academic as a scholar in in one topic i think you know you should not only publish papers in nature and new england stuff like that but you know you should try to to also write someone for the people who really paid our salaries and that's why i decided to write a book you know for people to you know summarize you know in an easier way my thinking and my knowledge my experience of 30 30 years of well 30 years as a scientist plus another 12 years as a doctor and a specialist in internal medicine and so i don't care you know if i don't sell but it's just a consideration that you know some i think you know wrong and simpleminded books you know they sell millions of copies and you know something that is really summarizing the best signs out there with limitation i'm not saying you know that you know we even you you know we don't know everything you know but i think you know we are at least you know summarizing the best signs in a kind of holistic way and having the prospective of the biology of aging that is revolutionary because you know we are not focused on obes it cardiovascular disease or cancer but you know because we are coming from the biology of aging field you know we have this idea of global health and the and the molecular pathways that are re really regulating longevity and li spin and hell spin and from the perspective of nutrition i mean uh i don't want to name names but there's a person who's out there who's basically an md but is on the pharma side of trying to get you to you know maximize lifespan which plays little you know but with little emphasis on whole food and well not little emphasis but uh not as much as it should be for example like uh total cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease i mean a statin is the easy way to go to drop your ldl but the fact is it doesn't address the problem which is unless you have hyper familial hyp cholesterolemia is easily addressable by diet you know a very high fiber diet will drop ldl in total cholesterol very quickly in a couple weeks but most people as you know don't don't eat much fiber at all right so i i haven't seen that approach in the you know the public space it's just take the yeah yeah you wonder if these people uh they are just uh my is is is a is is a sensation is a feeling but i think you know these people they are set up you know by these um companies could be selling certain ideas and products so or or or they lack the perspective and just think that that's the only way because they lack the perspective it could be that too i think i think more i think you know they lack the perspective but still i think you know look you know these big corporation they invest you know one two% of their money in propaganda yeah could be they they choose their influencer and they pay for their campaign you know and they they pay for space on socials and they become famous they have hundreds of thousand of people following them with money so if you you want you know if you have a new product is not the new product is the marketing is costing if you are a company is the marketing that is costing not the the you can have the best product whatsoever if you don't have the power of money to buy the publicity space you know the social space this on socials you know is very difficult to to to to to reach many people yeah definitely all right that was great luigi i appreciate it he thank you talk soon ch bye mike bye bye
