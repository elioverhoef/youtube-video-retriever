Longevity interventions what works and what doesn't to start let's have a look at data for glycine ergothioneine and nicotinamide riboside or nr supplementation in mice and their effects on longevity but is there something better and that something better may include bile acids so first does glycine supplementation extend lifespan so here we're looking at data survival data for uh females on the left and then males on the right and notice that it says pooled females and that's because data from three different study sites the jackson lab university of michigan and university of texas so each of these sites conducted their own independent lifespan studies looking at glycine supplementation and then this data these two images is the pool data from all three sites so it's essentially a meta-analysis for the effect of glycine supplementation on longevity so glycine supplementation was started at nine months in both the male and female mice and then when looking at median survival so this is 50 survival this is the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive we can see that glycine supplementation increased significantly increased lifespan median lifespan by 4 in females so what about maximum lifespan so this is a 10 survival this is the time when 90 of the colony has died and 10 is still alive so in the female mice glycine supplementation did not extend maximal lifespan all right what about the data in males so first median survival we can see that glycine supplementation significantly increased median survival in the male mice by six percent and similarly for maximum survival also a significant six percent increase for uh glycine supplementation so from this we can see that glycine extends lifespan in mice so what about in people now if glycine contributes to longevity in people i'd expect that long-lived people would have relatively higher blood levels of glycine so is this true so here we're looking at blood levels of glycine in people that were in the 94 to 105 year old age range so they had an average age of 97 years and then their offspring which were in the 50 to 79 year age range and then at that had an average age of 67 years and when comparing the older versus the younger group we can see that blood levels of glycine were 10 higher so is this statistically significant and in this case this is when the p value is less than 0.05 and the false discovery rate fdr which is an extra level of statistical rigor is also less than 0.05 so in both cases we can see that the p-value is less than 0.05 and the fdr is less than 0.052 so this is a 10 increase in before blood levels of glycine in the 97 year olds when compared with the younger age group so from this we can conclude higher blood levels of glycine in long-lived people so next up is ergothioneine and i've already presented this data in a in an earlier video and so that data will be in the right corner if you're interested in seeing the full story so i'm only going to present a little bit of the ergothionine data so this is uh survival curves for ergothione supplementation in fruit flies so this is the canton s strain for fruit flies and this is a data in females so when looking at median survival again 50 survival we can see that three different concentrations of ergothioneine supplementation and flies significantly extended median lifespan so what about in a different strain of flies and in this case that different strain is the yw strain and again in females so when looking at median survival we can again see two different uh concentrations of ergothioneine egt on the right significantly its extended lifespan so from this we can conclude that ergothioneine extends lifespan in flies and that data doesn't yet exist yet in mice or other mammals so we'll have to keep our eyes open for when those studies are eventually published so what about in people will ergothione extend lifespan of people now if ergothioney promotes longevity in people i'd expect again relatively higher blood levels in the long lived so for that we go back to to see if this is true we go back to that earlier study that i showed on the last slide for glycine and now we're looking at ergothione ergothioneine levels in blood so first and the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds we can see that the older group had a 40 reduction for blood levels of ergothioneine and this reduction is significant meaning the p-value and fdr are both less than 0.05 so in this case blood levels of ergothioneine are not higher in long-lived people so that kind of argues against them having a potential role on longevity in long-lived people now note that it also raises a question would increasing dietary ergothioneine in long-lived people further improve longevity and there's no data yet to see to test that so we'll have to stay tuned for those studies all right third on this list is nicotinamide riboside or nr so again here we're looking at pool data for females on the left and this again is in mice and this is again from pool data from three sites the jackson lab university of michigan and university of texas and i should note that this data is from the interventions testing program and one reason why they're considered the gold standard for lifespan studies is because uh they they do you know independent testing at multiple test sites and then pool that data so again it's like looking at a meta-analysis of uh supplements and there are potential effects on lifespan so note that supplementation with nr was a thousand parts per million and it was started in youth at eight months of age for both the female and male mice so uh in terms of nr we're looking at the pink triangles and then when looking at median survival for both the female on the left and male on the right mice we can see that nr did not have an effect on median lifespan in either female or male mice all right what about maximum survival again 10 survival 90 of the colony uh died i was already dead and 10 was still alive so similarly no effect on maximal survival for nr supplementation in either female or male mice now note that there's a lot of data on uh these lifespan curves so it's kind of hard to see because there's so much overlapping data so let's take a look at the actual numbers so here we're looking at median lifespan and first starting with the data in females we can see that median lifespan for the control fed mice was 874 days and for nicotinamide riboside supplemented female mice it was 8.75 but that p-value is 6.12 0.612 so we can see that median lifespan was not different for the nr supplemented female mice when compared with controls similarly for the male mice controls lived 787 days a median lifespan and our supplement the mice lived 763 days and that too that difference is not significant as indicated by the p-value of 0.25 all right in terms of maximum lifespan so 90th percentile 10 survival uh four controls uh the female controls they lived uh had a maximum lifespan of 1047 days and although the nr supplemented female mice lived 1068 days that that wasn't a significant difference as you can see by the p-value of 0.99 and then similarly for the male mice maximum lifespan not different as you can see by the 1047 days for the controls 1019 for the nr supplemented mice but again the p-value is 0.99 not even close to statistically significant so nr does not extend lifespan of mice now based on these data the expectation would be that long-lived people do not have higher levels of nr and blood when compared with younger subjects so again is that true so for that we go back to that initial study that looked at blood levels of many different things in the 97 year olds when compared with their offspring 67 year olds for nicotinamide riboside this time and for the older group we can see a one percent higher level of blood levels of nr and a significantly significantly higher levels of nr one by one percent in the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds so again yeah one percent higher blood levels than are in relatively long with people so but that raises the the question is one percent higher for nr enough to impact longevity so of these three interventions glycine with that four to six percent increased lifespan may be the most promising but is there something better and i know for most people the obvious is you know to jump out would be cr or rapamycin i've already covered those in other videos so let's take a look at something else and that something else may include bile acids so an abundance of bile acids are higher in long-lived older adults so this is data from that same study that compared the blood levels of many different things that were different for the 97 year olds versus their offspring the 67 year olds and as we can see by this very long list these are primary and secondary bile acids the whole list is just those you know metabolites that are bile acids so when comparing the 97 year olds versus the 67 year olds you can see that starting from the bottom of the list glycocolate the 97 year olds had a 16 higher blood level of glycocolate when compared with the 67 year olds but if you go all the way up to the top of the list you can see that the longest lived had more than seven fold higher levels of a particular bile acid known as ersocholate and if you look at the median on this list it's about two fold higher so erso deoxycolate somewhere around 2.1 2.06 to be specific in terms of blood levels in the 97 year olds when compared to the 67 year olds in other words when looking at all the bile acids on this list they're not up by a little bit they're up by a lot and where there's smoke there's fire and what i mean by that is this isn't one bile acid that's higher in the longest group it's a whole bunch of them so let's go into the bile acid story more because this is their first time appearing on my channel so it's important to introduce them so starting from cholesterol in the liver cholesterol undergoes a series of enzymatic steps to be degraded into primary bile acids ca colic acid otherwise known as collate and cdca which is known as chino kino or chino or quinoa i'm not sure how it's pronounced but kino deoxycolic acid or kino deoxycolate cdca now those two primary bile acids can then be converted into other forms in particular conjugated with either taurine or glycine to form toro ca glycoca or toro cdca or glycocd now note that on this list for uh blood metabolites that were higher in the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds each of these four metabolites are there and again not up by a little bit in blood by up by a lot as much as 2.1 fold higher for toro kino deoxycolate in the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds now these primary bile acids are then stored in the gallbladder and are then released after a meal into the intestine to promote lipid absorption now once these bile acids are in the intestine primary primary bile acids bas are converted by gut bacteria into secondary bile acids and there are just a few secondary bile acids that are shown on this uh cartoon but there are many different forms and uh that aren't included in the cartoon and that you can see on the list on the left so just as a few examples of secondary bile acids we can see dca so deoxycolic acid or deoxycolate and then we can see udca ersodeoxycolic acid ursodeoxycolate and lca lithocolate now two of these secondary bile acids are on the list the oxycolate is 86 higher in the 97 year olds versus the 67 year olds and er so deoxycolate is again 2. 2.06 fold higher in the older group when compared with younger so how are bile acids related to longevity besides the associations that are in the longest live versus short shorter live let's have a look at more data for bile acids and how they may relate to longevity so primary and secondary bile acids are increased in blood from dwarf mice which have increases for average and maximum lifespan and that's what we can see here but we need to introduce what we're looking at in terms of the model so the model the dwarf model that we're looking at are lit lit mice and they're indicated by the black circles and the lit lit mice have a mutation for the receptor for growth hormone releasing hormone ghrh which as the primary intervention results in 99 reduced circulating levels of growth hormone but also reduced circulating levels of igf-1 all right so now back to the survival data so we're looking at median survival first starting with the controls and note that the median survival for the controls is 30 months which in comparison to other interventions the control strain is often short-lived like in the case of alpha-ketoglutarate and berberine controls were short-lived so a small extension of median lifespan by those interventions got them to you know 30 months or a little bit above but the control chain was short-lived so in other words for this study and looking at dwarf versus controls the control strain was not short-lived as they had a median lifespan of 30 months so these dwarf mice have a 23 to 25 increase for average lice men including both males and females and similarly when looking at maximum lifespan or 10 survival uh dwarf these dwarf mice the little little mice also have a 15 increase for maximum lifespan so now we can return to the original premise of this slide which is that primary and secondary bile acids are increased in blood from dwarf mice which is what we see here so starting on the left we've got the primary and secondary bile acids and their concentration in the little mice or these dwarf mice lit lit mice in wild top mice so normal mice and then the ratio between the little mice with the wild top mice so just highlighting three of these primary and secondary bile acids that were on the list for the longest lived human group and that's what's shown here deoxycolate cola and erso deoxycolate we can see that these bile acids aren't up by a little in the dwarf mice they're up by a lot so for example deoxycolate is up 3.7 fold colic acid is up 3.5 fold and er so deoxycolic is up 2.8 fold in the dwarf mice when compared with the wild-type mice and then looking at the total of all of these bile acids we can see that uh beyond the three that i indicated the sum of all these bile acids on the list are 4.2 fold higher in the dwarf mice that have extended longevity were compared with wild-type mice and again note that these uh bylasses the ones that have boxed are rectangled were also higher in blood from long-lived people so note that this isn't the only animal model where bile acids are increased in association in association with longevity so let's have a look at that data so first starting with a dietary methionine restriction that's been shown to extend lifespan and i presented this in a in another video on my on my channel so if you're interested just look up methionine restriction and you will find that data so just as a quick review methionine restriction extend light extends lifespan so when starting from median survival of the control strain we can see that methionine restriction significantly increased median survival six points by six point six percent and also maximum survival as we can see there now liver levels of colic acid again which is a primary bile acid are increased on a methionine restriction restricted diet and that it's increased in liver that indica indicates that there's an increase in synthesis of colic acid so what are we looking at here wild type cd or mice on the control diet on the left and then wtmr is mice on the methionine restricted diet and with that green arrow we can see that mice on the methionine restricted diet have higher level up liver levels of colic acid so from this although methionine restriction is the primary intervention we can see that colic acid is associated with longevity in mice on a methionine restricted diet now i to go further there are more animal models where bile acids are increased in association with longevity and that's what we can see here by looking at levels of colic acid in product mice on a methionine restricted diet now progeria is a mouse model of accelerated aging so for the mouse model of accelerated aging for pro product mice that's the g609g and these are pro-droid mice on a control diet cd now note that to start there are very low levels of colic acid in these product mice and then in this study they fed these product mice or methionine restricted diet or mr and then we can see that levels of colic acid are significantly increased in the progeria mouse model so what's the importance of higher ca colic acid levels in prodroid mice on a methionine restricted diet well dietary methionine restriction extends lifespan in this pro-droid mouse model so when looking at median lifespan for the controls we can see that there was a significant increase by 20 in the pro-droid mice on a methionine-restricted diet and it close to significant increase for maximum lifespan with a p-value of 0.08 for maximum lifespan now note again note that although the primary intervention is methionine restriction relatively higher levels of the bile acid colic acid ca is a part of this story so what about causation everything i've shown so far for colic acid is just association what about causation can bile acid supplementation independently increase lifespan and as we'll see colic acid supplementation extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated accelerated aging or progeria and that's what we can see here so in this case they use a different model for progeria which is the zmp ste knockout mice so again this is an accelerated aging model or progeria and in this study they divided the mice in two fed one project pro droid uh group controlled a control diet and the second they fed them with 0.1 percent colic acid or ca and what we can see when looking at median survival when compared with controls was that there was a seven percent increase for median survival in the pro-droid mice fed a colic acid diet uh and in terms of maximum survival which was uh 20 survival in this case so 80 of the colony died 20 was still alive this was borderline significant with a p value right at the border 0.054 so this then raises another question would uh colic acid or collate supplementation in age mice that are not pro-droid extend lifespan and that study hasn't been published yet so i'm eager to see if slash when that study is published to see if it actually impacts to see if it impacts aging and not just accelerated aging models but it also raises the question is colic acid related to longevity in people and just to refresh your memory colic acid was indeed found on that list of metabolites in particular bile acids that were higher in the 97 year olds when compared with the 67 year olds as shown there it was 22 percent higher and the longest lived group when compared with their offspring and it was statistically significant as you can see by the p and a p value in fdr less than 0.05 so this then raises other questions will other bile acids besides collate when considering that long list of bile acids that are higher in the longest lived group 97 year olds will other bile acids increase longevity in mice and potentially even people and if that's true if colic acid and other bile acids are able to impact longevity in people how can we how can we optimize levels of bile acids in our blood what interventions can possibly affect levels of bile acids in in our blood and stay tuned for that i'll have videos on that coming up sometime in the future so with all this in mind in terms of bile acids they may be the next frontier in longevity research as there's very little press on them yet but uh that may change after uh people see this video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
