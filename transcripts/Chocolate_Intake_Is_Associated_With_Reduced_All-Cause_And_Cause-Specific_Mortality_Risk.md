# Chocolate Intake Is Associated With Reduced All-Cause And Cause-Specific Mortality Risk

## Transcript

Today's video is going to be all about chocolate and one reason for that is because a couple of months ago a paper was published that showed chalk consumption to be associated with reduced risk for all cause and cause specific mortality so let's have a look at the data so here we're looking at the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against chocolate consumption in servings per week on the x-axis and note that one serving of chocolate was defined as less than one average bar or less than one ounce so about 28 grams now the hazard ratio of one is where we can assess statistical significance so when the purple the dashed purple dotted lines which is indicative of the 95 confidence interval is completely below a hazard ratio of one in this case we have statistical significance so what does the data show when compared with the red arrow people who consume no chocolate we can see that the green arrow was the lowest all-cause mortality risk and that was present for a little bit more than half of a serving of chocolate per week so around 18 grams of chocolate per week but note that for all chocolate intakes uh one up to eight plus servings per week we can see that the dashed purple line is below a hazard ratio of one which when compared with no chocolate intake all-cause mortality risk was reduced for all chocolate intakes as high as eight plus servings per week in never smokers so what about in smokers so in smokers there was a lesser effect where it was about eight to a nine percent decreased all-cause mortality risk acm risk for current or firm former smokers and with a pretty large sample size too similar to the non-smokers so about forty seven thousand subjects but in their case uh it was significant for one serving of chocolate per week when compared with no servings of chocolate per week and then higher intakes of chocolate were not associated with the reduced all-cause mortality risk in the current or former smokers so a small amount of chocolate may be beneficial based on this data when compared with not eating any chocolate now cost-specific mortality was also reduced not just all-cause mortality risk so let's have a look at that data so first starting with cardiovascular disease mortality uh when comparing people who didn't eat any chocolate so that zero chocolate intake per week that was defined as the reference and then when looking at higher intakes of chocolate per week so up to half a serving 0 to 0.5 half a serving to one serving one to two servings per week and then greater than two servings per week we can see that all intakes of chocolate above zero regardless of the model so the less adjusted model model one including more variables model two and then the fully adjusted model model three we can see that all intakes of chocolate above zero was associated with a significantly reduced cardiovascular disease mortality risk similarly alzheimer's disease mortality risk was also reduced for people who consumed more chocolate than none so when compared with no chocolate intake which was used as the reference we can see that half a serving up to two servings uh per day regardless of the model model one two or three was associated with significantly reduced alzheimer's disease mortality risk now uh models one and two weren't significantly associated with a reduced alzheimer's disease mortality risk for people who consume more than two servings of chocolate per day but we can see the fully adjusted model model 3 was indeed statistically significant for people who consumed more than two servings of chocolate per week when compared with no chocolate per week also note that up to half a serving per week for alzheimer's disease mortality risk was not significantly different from people who did not consume any chocolate per week so based on this we can conclude that chalk and consumption is significantly associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular and alzheimer's disease mortality now note that cancer cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality were not significantly associated with any intake of chocolate so is this just related to healthy user bias so do people who eat more chocolate than none have a healthier overall lifestyle which is potentially explaining these effects so to assess that they uh the authors of this study examine some metrics that can be related to healthy user bias including the amount of physical activity and minutes per week fruit and vegetable intake and added sugar so for in people that consume no chocolate they actually had higher levels of physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake when compared with people who had relatively higher amounts of chocolate intake as shown there with the red box similarly people who consume no chocolate had a lower added sugar intake when compared with the chocolate consumers more than two servings per week who had almost double of an added sugar intake so from this we can conclude that maybe healthy user bias is not involved here that chocolate consumers were less physically active ate less fruit and vegetables but more added sugars so note that this study is based on associations and association doesn't equal causation so is there uh is there data for an impact of chocolate on health in randomized controlled trials rcts so in one of these and there are many rcts for chocolates chocolate intakes effects on health and i'll link to those studies below for so i'm just going to go through one of these studies uh in this video so in this study they compared people consuming 100 grams per day of dark chocolate versus 90 grams per day of white chocolate in 15 subjects for 15 days and this is this was in relatively young subjects that were 34 years old and had a normal weight bmi of 23. So first what was the effect on insulin sensitivity so to assess that they looked at home ir which is the homeostasis model assessment and the ir stands for insulin resistance so they compared homa ir values which are calculated based on fasting data for insulin and glucose in people before the study started and then after the 15 days when they were consuming the 100 grams per day of dark chocolate and then similarly they compared home r values before and after the study for people who were consuming white chocolate now note that white chocolate differs from all of the other chocolates so milk dark bittersweet cocoa powder cocoa beans etc white chocolate contains cocoa butter but no cocoa solids which contain most of the polyphenols and that'll become important in a minute so in terms of insulin sensitivity is defined by homo ir a lower home hour value is indicative of more insulin sensitivity and we can see in that the people that were consuming the dark chocolate they had a reduction in homo ir which is an improvement in insulin sensitivity in contrast the people that were consuming white chocolate did not see a reduction in home ir no reduction no improvement in insulin sensitivity so the authors of this study oh but just just as a quick blurb so there was this data shows that there was improved insulin sensitivity in the dark but not the white chocolate group so the authors of this study also looked at the effect of chocolate intake on blood pressure in the two different uh groups dark chocolate versus white chocolate and that's we can see here so systolic blood pressure on the y axis before and after uh so not consuming uh so before the study started and then after dark chocolate consumption and then similarly we see systolic blood pressure on the y axis here before and after white chocolate consumption and what we can see is that in the dark chocolate consumers there was a reduction in blood pressure for the dark chocolate group but not in the white chocolate group so what are some potential mechanisms for chocolate's effects on health and one potential explanation involves the polyphenol epicatechin so why is epicatechin important well simply it extends lifespan at least in mice so that's what's shown here so in this study epication ec was administered in the drinking water to 20 month old mice which when considering a 40 month maximal lifespan in mice that's equivalent to about a 60 year old person so oc are the old controls that were not given epicatechin compared to the ec epicatechin so this was a study that was a 37-week study and then after 37 weeks they assess survival in epicatagen supplemented versus the old mice that we're not getting not eat not drinking uh epicatechin so after 37 weeks in the uh old controls so no catechin only 39 percent of the mice were still alive in contrast the epicatechin supplement in my 70 was were still alive and then even seven weeks after this the 37 week study 44 of the epication mice were still alive so we can see that lifespan extending effect of epicatechin so uh with that in mind how much epication is in chocolate so this is data obtained from the usda flavonoid database and i'll link to that in the description below video's description below so here we're looking at um white chocolate milk chocolate dark chocolate and bittersweet chocolate so white chocolate has no epic epic catechin content and this is in milligrams of epication per 100 grams of food milk chocolate has more 11 milligrams per 100 grams dark chocolate has 42 to 84 milligrams per hundred grams and then bittersweet chocolate or sorry baking chocolate which is essentially the same thing has 143 milligrams of epicatechin per 100 grams but cocoa powder is the all-star here for epicatechin content as we can see it has 196 milligrams of catechin per 100 grams now these are all processed the all of these versions of chocolate are the processed version of the whole food which is cocoa beans so to get epicatechin into my diet i grind whole cocoa beans and i mix them with dates and also note that i've tracked my dietary intake as many of you know on this channel since 2015 i've been tracking macro and micronutrients and i started tracking food intake in july of 2018. So with that in mind is 18 grams of chocolate and that should be per week or some other amount optimal for health and we can assess that by looking at my own n of one data so how much cocoa is optimal based on my own n of one data and as i mentioned i have three plus years of every day tracking my dietary intake and over that time period i have 17 blood tests that course that correspond so this is going to be my average daily cocoa bean intake versus the big picture biomarkers and if you've seen my recent videos these are biomarkers of overall systemic health as shown here so there are 22 biomarkers including glucose which should be obvious for any pro longevity strategy in recent videos i had homocysteine here but i only have six blood tests for homocysteine so i didn't include it for this video but as i have more data for homocysteine i'll likely include it so i've got three markers of kidney function uh four markers of liver function all of the major lipoproteins i've got a few immune cells the major immune cells neutrophils lymphocytes percentage of lymphocytes platelets red blood cells and then a couple of red blood cell related measures inflammation including high sensitivity c reactive protein and then the overall biological age score when using levine's phenotypic age and aging.ai and note that the little n is indicative of how many blood tests that i have over this three plus year period so what is cocoa my average daily coca bean intake associated with is associated with any biomarkers going the right direction or in the wrong direction so first in terms of biomarkers going in the right direction we can see that a relatively higher cocoa bean intake is associated with a lower amount of ast the liver enzyme aspartate amino transferase and that's potentially a good thing because my asc levels can trend as high as 40 and if you've missed my ast video value somewhere in the low 20s may be optimal so that's one biomarker going in the right direction similarly a higher cocoa bean intake is significantly correlated with a higher higher levels of red blood red blood cells and that's important because red blood cells decline during aging now conversely also going in the right direction though is a higher cocoa bean intake is associated with a lower mcv so mcv or the mean red blood cell volume uh increases during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so that they're associated with lower a lower mcbs potentially going in the right direction so i've got three biomarkers going in the right direction in correlation with cocoa bean intake what about going in the wrong direction so there's only one that's significantly significant and that's the percentage of lymphocytes so a relatively higher cocobean intake is correlated with correlated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes and the percentage of lymphocytes declines during aging so that's just one reason why that's going in the wrong direction so the overall score there is plus two three going in the right direction one going in the wrong direction in terms of their correlation with my cocoa bean intake but note that one of these four significant correlations at least based on the nominal p-value with a p-value less than 0.05 may be a false positive and that's because by definition when the p-value is 0.05 that means you've got one false positive for 20 measurements and i just did 22 measurements so it's possible that one of these will be a false positive so to account for that we can we can calculate the adjusted p value and in this example i used the benjamini hockberg hochberg method so that helps to ask the question what's the probability that the nominally significant p values are false positives so in this case when looking at the four statistically significant values based on p-values we can see that the adjusted p-values range from 0.17 to 0.20 so there isn't really an improvement in over p-values in this case as there's an 80 to 83 percent chance that these four correlations are not false positives so based on this data it when considering that one of them may be a false positive at worst the net score is plus one so instead of having three going in the right direction now it's two two versus one going the wrong direction net plus one but at best i've got a net of plus 3. For example the lymphocyte percentage may be a false positive so it would be 3 going the right direction none going in the wrong direction so when considering that the overall effect is net positive in this case cocoa bean intake is significantly correlated with a better than average effect on my uh systemic biomarkers now note that if there were there was an equal amount of biomarkers going in the right and wrong direction the net effect would be neutral and conversely if i had more biomarkers going in the wrong direction and then in the right direction that would suggest that cocoa bean intake would have a negative effect on my overall systemic health so with that in mind and based on this data how much cocoa may be optimal for me so this is my cocoa bean intake over the past three plus years period and each data point uh corresponds to the average intake that corresponds to a blood test so during this three plus year period my average daily cocoa bean intake is 12 grams per day but i have a pretty wide range from as low as about 1 gram of cocoa beans per day to about 18 19 grams per day so when considering that my net score was positive this suggests that i should eat somewhere uh from my average intake to my highest intake if the net score was neutral i'd eat as close to my average as possible and if my net score was negative i'd be below my average intake for the next blood test and then i would continually reassess these correlations this to try to get as close to the truth as possible now note that in in contrast with the john at all study that identified 18 grams of chocolate per week as optimal my own n of one data suggests that somewhere between 12 is you know about 19 grams of cocoa beans per day not per week may be optimal all right that's all for now if you're interested in more in terms of my biohacking approach for aging you can check us out on patreon and thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
