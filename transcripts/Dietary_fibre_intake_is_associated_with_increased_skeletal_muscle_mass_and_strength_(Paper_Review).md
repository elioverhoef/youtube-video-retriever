## Transcript

A new study was published earlier this week that identified significant associations for a relatively higher dietary fiber intake with muscle mass and strength but also higher bone mineral content and improved insulin sensitivity as indicated by houma and more on that in a minute but also lower fat mass insulin and glucose so let's have a look at the data so first let's start with body weight or body mass and that's on the y-axis which is plotted against dietary fiber intake in grams per day and what we can see is that when looking at a linear model in blue or a non-linear model the spline model in red we can see that the higher the dietary fiber intake the lower the body body mass and i should mention that this data is from nhanes 2011 through 2018 so the u.s national health and nutrition examination survey and for data on body mass it included more than 6000 people that had an average age of 50 years so unsurprisingly because bmi includes body weight as the numerator we see a similar trend for bmi so the higher the dietary fiber intake the lower the bmi and again this data goes up to about 50 grams per day now it's important to note that all the models that i'm going to present from the paper were adjusted for factors that can impact these associations including gender age ethnicity socioeconomic status smoking status and how physically active or inactive defined as sedentary activity also dietary factors including calorie intake alcohol intake and diet composition including the percentage of calories from protein carbohydrate and fat were included as variables in uh that were accounted for so they these models were adjusted for those factors so uh body weight and bmi are interesting but more specifically what's the association between dietary fiber intake with body composition so it's important to note that body composition was assessed with dual x-ray absorptiometry otherwise known as dexa which provides info about whole body lean mass whole body fat mass and whole body bone mineral content so first starting with whole body lean mass and it's on the y axis we see relative total whole body lean mass divided by body weight because with a larger body mass you'd expect to have more lean mass so by dividing by whole body whole body weight grams of lean mass divided by body weight you account for body size so that's on the y-axis plotted against dietary fiber intake on the x-axis and what we can see is for both the linear and non-linear model the higher the dietary fiber intake that's associated with a higher whole body lean mass now it's important to note that when measuring total body or whole body lean mass by dexa it doesn't only include skeletal muscle but the organs too and one way to account for that is by measuring appendicular lean mass which includes lean mass of the arms plus legs so that's what we can see here relative relative levels of appendicular lean mass so uh lean mass of the arms and legs divided by uh body weight whole body weight a whole body body weight and that's plotted against dietary fiber intake on the x-axis and again both the linear and non-linear models we can see that the higher the dietary fiber intake the higher the levels of appendicular or relative levels of appendicular lean mass so uh having more muscle mass and again appendicular lean mass because it's our arms and legs and there are no organs there are no major organs it's usually thought of as an as a pretty good marker of skeletal muscle mass so is this an indication of having more muscle mass but what's the consequence on function so strength muscle strength and that's what we can see here so uh on the y-axis we've got relative combined grip strength so this is the grip strength of the right and left hands combined divided by body weight and that's plotted on the x-axis against dietary fiber intake in grams per day and notice that the sample size the n for this data is significantly less than the body weight measurement so this is about 5300 subjects that had an average age of 58 years and again from the same study though nhanes 2011 through 2018. So we can again see that for both the linear and the non-linear model the higher the dietary fiber intake the higher the grip strength so uh muscle changes for muscle and muscle strength muscle mass and strength usually track with bone changes so higher levels of muscle mass and strength you usually track with higher levels of bone mineral density and conversely lower levels of muscle mass and strength usually track with lower bone mineral density so what what's the association for bone mineral density so that's what we can see here relative bone total body bone mineral content on the y-axis plotted against dietary fiber intake and we can see that once fiber intake gets about past about 20 grams per day we can see significantly higher levels of bone mineral content in association with high relatively higher levels of dietary fiber intake so to summarize these data so far a higher dietary fiber intake up to about 50 grams per day as in this study is significantly associated with higher levels of lean mass higher muscle mass in other words the appendicular muscle mass higher levels of grip strength and higher levels of bone mineral content so what about fat mass so that's what we can see here relative levels of whole body lean mass divided by body weight and that's plotted against fiber intake on the x-axis and now we see an inverse association the higher the dietary fiber intake again up to 50 grams per day the lower the levels of whole body fat mass now similar data were also identified for trunk fat mass and that's important because trunk fat mass has a large influence on insulin sensitivity so with that in mind is a higher dietary diet sorry dietary fiber intake associated with lower levels of glucose and or insulin so uh here's the glucose data and we're looking at fasting levels of glucose on the y plotted against fiber intake on the x-axis and now we see more variability we can see that shaded region which is the confidence interval for the data both for the linear and non-linear model we can see that it's not both below zero which would indicate a significant effect however in the study they uh with the statistics with the model adjustments they actually found a small but statistically significant effect for relatively higher levels of fiber on having a lower faster glucose now what about fasting levels of insulin and that's what we can see here so although the glucose data is more variable and somewhat close closer to statistical significance now we can see a more stronger a stronger effect for the association between fiber intake with fasting levels of insulin and for both the linear and non-linear model now we see that the higher the levels of fiber the higher levels of dietary fiber intake the lower the levels of fasting insulin which is going in the right direction because insulin levels increase during aging so uh it isn't just insulin that a higher fiber intake was associated with a higher fiber intake was also associated with insulin sensitivity and the way they assessed that was by looking at homo which is the uh the homeostasis model assessment it's a homo2 ir as a model of insulin resistance and that's on the y-axis and it's calculated with measurements of the fasting glucose and insulin data so now we can see the uh the data tracks with the insulin data even though the glucose data was somewhat variable we can see that overall insulin sensitivity as indicated by homa for relatively high levels of dietary fiber there is more insulin sensitivity as indicated by a lower home of homoscore now it's important to note that all of the data in this study are associations what about causation so uh there aren't any randomized controlled trials rcts yet for the impact of uh fiber fiber intakes greater than 50 grams per day on body composition in older adults and i've studied this pretty extensively i've looked into the literature pretty extensively if anyone's come across studies that have looked at fiber intakes greater than 50 grams per day on body composition so lean mass bone density fat mess please post it in the comments below share share with the community now there is one study that has has looked at the impact of a more than 50 grams of fiber per day on insulin sensitivity more specifically on insulin levels so when when compared with 20 grams per day at baseline when those same subjects were given 51 grams per day uh that was enough to reduce uh insulin levels by 29 in 53 year olds so that's it just one study one rct looking at the impact of a higher fiber diet on body composition and insulin levels insulin and glucose insulin sensitivity uh in older adults so with this in mind i think there should be rcts that go after that hypothesis that a very high fiber diet more than 50 grams per day can improve body composition and metabolic features including insulin sensitivity in relatively older adults all right that's all for now uh if you're interested in more uh
