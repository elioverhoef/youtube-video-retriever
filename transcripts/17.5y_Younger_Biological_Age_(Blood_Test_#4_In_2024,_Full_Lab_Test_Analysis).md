# 17.5y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #4 In 2024, Full Lab Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happened over many decades so if we track and optimize well established biomarkers of organ and systemic function can aging and disease risk be slowed so apologies to those who have heard this a trillion times but that's the central premise of the channel and with that in mind about two weeks ago i blood tested for the fourth time in 2024 and note that this is blood test number 52 since 2015 so what's my biological age and we'll see that here this is using dr morgan the's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you have blood test data and you want to measure your own biological age using this test there's a downloadable free excel link in the video's description so when entering these nine biomarkers and chronological age i get a biological age of 33.8 years which is 17.5 years younger than my chronological of 51.3 years but note that i've highlighted crp there i messed up on the order i ordered crp and not hs crp so i actually don't know what hs crp is because the crp test only measures less than 3 mig per liter it doesn't get as close to under3 mig per liter so that that's an imputed data now i think it's a fair guess to say that hscp may be 0.3 milligrams per liter as for 17 cons consecutive tests before this test it was less than 0.3 mg per liter that said said it's not a guarantee it could be a bit higher thereby reducing the 17.5 year reduction relative to my chronological age and rather than just looking at data ent entered into a spreadsheet blood test data screenshots of the lab report are coming up in about a minute now as i mentioned for most biomarkers and most biomarker testing it's important not to get too high or too low for the results as it's just one test so with that in mind for more context let's take a look at biological age results biological age results using pheno age since 2018 as i have 33 tests over that time period and that's what we can see here so when i first started testing 2018 to 2019 i had three tests with an average of 36.1 years and then in 20120 2021 i tested 12 times six times each year with an average age of or an average biological age using pheno ag of 35.6 years for each of those two years for both 2020 and 2021 then my best year to date 2022 33.8 years it got a bit worse in 2023 with an average of 34.7 years and thus far after four tests in 2024 i'm off to a great start once again pushing that lower limit of my best data at 33.7 years so i would never claim to reverse aging but with this approach it should be clear at least since 2018 that at best i may be slowing biological age all right as i mentioned this is data entered into a spreadsheet let's take a look at the blood test result uh blood test report as it's important to not only focus on a few biomarkers but to look at as many as possible as i mentioned as many uh biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible so let's check out the full blood test report so starting with total testosterone at 965 this is relatively youthful so no reason for concern there but we can see that free testosterone is on the relatively low side towards the lower end of the range and that's particularly uh because of shbg sex hormone binding globulin you can see that i'm almost three times higher than the reference range now shbg is an interesting biomarker on the one hand it increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased alzheimer's disease incident risk and i'll put the link for those videos in the video's description but on the other hand it's two times higher for people on cr relative to people on a standard diet and it's posibly associated with insulin sensitivity which suggests it could relatively high levels could be a good thing especially when considering that calorie restriction is probably the gold standard for extending lifespan in a variety of animal models so i i'll have more insight into the shbg and free testosterone and what may be optimal in a future video all right going further we've got hdl at 54 the optimal range for hdl is 50 to 60 i covered that in an earlier video on the channel and more importantly i've had had issues with relatively low hdl so in contrast hdl has been greater than or equal to 50 mg per deciliter for 9 tests in a row with an average over those nine tests of about 55 milligram per deciliter in contrast for the 43 tests since 2015 it was about 10 mg per deciliter less and rather than just looking at two different groups of data we can compare them statistically and when using a two sample t test we can see that i've been able to significantly improve hdl over the past nine tests about the past 15 months relative to the earlier data since 2015 all right on to the second page of the report we can see that homosysteine is still a weak spot 10.8 micromolar is age expected which is a dirty word in my lingo because i want to have everything youthful and not age expected now for this test i uh tested the ex hypothesis that increasing protein intake with lower homosysteine and that's in part because a relatively higher protein intake in my day is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine now i decided to focus on branch chain amino acids and i supplemented with 5 grams per day which is a 50% increase relative to my average intake because there's data in a parkinson's animal model where branch chain amino acids are fermented by uh gut bacteria uh reducing neur neurod degeneration potentially by reducing homocysteine so i decided to test that hypothesis thinking that i may be just deficient in bcaas and limit mited in terms of gut bacterial fermentation into propionate uh but as we can see with 5 gr of bcas per day that didn't impact homosysteine at all all right we can also see glucose even though lavine's pheno age was a relatively youthful 17 and a half years younger than my chronological my glucose level for this test was my second worst over those 52 tests since 2015 so i intend on bringing that down on further tests on the other hand creatinine is close to my lowest value which is good news because creatin levels increase during aging now creatinine is proportional to muscle mass and it's hard to believe that i lost muscle mass in you know in about a month since the last test so a lower cre creatinine level could be indicative of better kidney function and in support of that we can see that uric acid levels are close to the lowest end that i've had over all my tests and uric acid levels increase in the presence of poor kidney function so that i get a reduction in creatinine which suggests better kidney function and a reduction for uric acid potentially s suggesting better clearance systemically lowering uric acid th those are two markers suggest of a better kidney function for this test all right and then we can also see thyroid hormones which i'm going to track for every test going forward because my free t3 to free t4 ratio is a bit lower than i'd like and i covered that in an early video which will be in the right corner so for this test i increased brazil nut intake to get close to the tolerable upper limit of 400 micrograms per day of selenium because selenium is a required co-actor for conversion of t4 into t3 and and based on that experiment i expected to see higher free t3 with an increase in dietary selenium but it barely moved it went from 2.3 to 2.4 for free t3 whereas free t4 stayed the same as it was for the april test so i get a i got a very marginal increase for the free t3 to free t4 ratio nonetheless i increased brazil nut intake for only 16 days i'm going to keep that relatively high and aim for that 400 microgram per day target until the next test which will probably be uh sometime in late july and then we'll see if that makes an impact with a longer duration uh of doing the experiment uh sometime then all right then we can also see the white blood cell count at 3.6 is towards the lower side of the range but in an earlier video on the channel we saw that white blood cells in the 3.5 to 6 range is associated with the longest life expectancy relative to 6,00 or higher so that's potentially good news but i find it more instructive to focus not on the total white blood cell counts but their distributions including nutrifil lymphocytes and monocytes as they account for more than 95% of total white blood cell counts and whereas neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging lymphocytes decrease during aging so it's possible to have no change in white blood cells during aging but have increases for the neutrophils and monocytes while the lymphocytes are decreasing and in line with that hypothesis we can see that my lymphocytes which were never a problem always somewhere around relatively youthful 2000 prior to this year 200000 also being associated with lowest all cause mortality risk for the past few tests they've been closer to 1,500 or less so that's on the priority list for bringing them back to 2000 uh stay tuned for that in an upcoming video for how i did it and then on to page three where we can see that it similar to the white blood cell story if i only focused on that and didn't look at distribution you know nutrifil monocytes and lymphocytes i would miss that lymphocytes have declined and knowing that they declined during aging that's going in the wrong direction if i only focused on the lymphocytic youthful based on age related plots they decline during aging the lymy percentage declines during aging i would miss that you know the once again i would miss the lymphocytes being low if i only focused on lymy percentage and total white blood cell counts so it's important to look at the details you know under the hood and then we can see how i messed up c reactor protein that's not the hscp measurement as you can see it's less than 3 milligrams per liter hscp the lower li limit of detection is.3 milligrams per liter and then last but not least and still a weak spot is dhea sulfate although i've been able to keep it relatively stable for the past two years which is good news because it declines during aging i've had values about twice as high 15 years ago the goal is to get back to that or to get my system to get it back to that all all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i do blood test consults we've also got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea dieet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
