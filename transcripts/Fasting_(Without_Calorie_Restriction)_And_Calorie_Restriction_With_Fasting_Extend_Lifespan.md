Fasting without calorie restriction and calorie restriction with fasting extend lifespan and that's what we'll see here these data are from a recently published study and if you want to read the study yourself it'll be in the video's description so on the y-axis we've got the survival probability how many mice had died and how many mice were alive and on the x-axis we've got age in month so how long did the mice live and then the intervention was started at 6 months so starting at 6 months of age mice were randomly assigned to one of five groups as shown there and note that 192 mice were used for each group so that the total study included 960 mice and as just as a quick aside if you see lifespan studies that used eight mice or rats per group that pales in comparison to a study like this which used 192 mice per group 960 in total all right so let's take a deeper dive into each of these five groups so ad lib is ad libitum that means the mice could eat as as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and we can see that there are gray squares for all of the days so they could eat whatever they want as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and then one day of fasting we can see that that was for half the day on wednesday and half the day on thursday so they fasted for one day per week similarly the 2d is two days of fasting so midday wednesday through midday friday and then there was a 20% cal restricted group so you can see that their squares they orange squares are 20% smaller relative to ad lib and they ate like that from monday through thursday on friday they got their weekend food so generally lab techs don't work on weekends so they gave them three days of food in one day so the mice in the 20% cr group then ate all of their food on friday and saturday and had no food left on sunday so they fasted for one day a week so 20% cr with one day of fasting and then the 40% group similarly they had much smaller food obviously 40% relative to ad lib monday through thursday and then for their weekend food they too received 3 days worth of food on friday but they ate all of their food on friday and then nothing on the remaining two days so what was the impact on lifespan so for that we put up a black line at 0.5% uh5 survival that's the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive that's median survival 50% survival and when compared with the ad lib group we can see that there are two lines that basically overlap in terms of an increased median lifespan the one day and two days of fasting so let's take a deeper dive into food intake for those groups which is shown here so when comparing the one day of fasting to ad lib we can see that they actually ended up eating close to significantly more food relative to ad lib 2.5% more relative to the group that could eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and you can see that the p value is 0.06 so in other words the group that fasted for one day per week ate 2.5% more food than ad lib and that amount of food was very close to significantly higher than the adlib group nonetheless that one day of fasting without cali restriction was sufficient to extend median lifespan for the one day of fasting crew on the other hand the group that had two days of a fast ended up calorie restricted so they ate 11.5% less food than the ad lib group but interestingly the magnitude of the lif extension was the same as the group that didn't cr but had one day of fasting so it suggests that there's a window of not having to be cr where we can potentially get an increased at least median lifespan all right so the group that was 20% cr had a further rightwood shift a further increase for median lifespan relative to ad lip and for that group when quantifying actual food intake it ended up being 27.1% cr not 20% but the largest increase in lipan median lipan when comparing all of these groups as you can see is that red line that's the 40% cr group that saw 36% increase in median lifespan and in terms of actual food consumed and then ended up being about 44% less relative to ad lib but where this story gets more interesting is that the 40% cr group ended up resisting the age related decline for wheel running in other words this just wasn't a study of mice in the cage given less food or more food or fasting or not fasting they all had access to running wheels and the group that was 40% cr as we'll see ended up resisting that age related wheel running decline so on the y- axis we've got wheel running in kilometers per day and then plotted against age in months so prior to the study onset at 5 months of age we can see that all of the five groups ran a similar amount in their wheels at at 5 months of age but then during aging we can see that all of the groups except for one ran less on the wheel every day and that one group that didn't run less over time was that 40% cr group so not only did the 40% cr group have the longest lifespan they were also the most physically active for the duration of their lifespan so where the story gets even more interesting and i me i know i've said that a few times already but this paper is a gold mine of information is that there was lifespan variability between the groups so what does that mean so on the left we've got our five groups and then starting with median lifespan for the uh longest live group the 40% cr group at 36 months that was their median lifespan so i put a green line there we can see that to the right of that uh having mice live longer than 36 months wasn't exclusive to the longest lived mice so the 40% cr our group you can see that for all of the other groups there were mice that lived longer than 36 months even in the ad lib group in the ad lib group which then led the authors to ask what might contribute to a longer lifespan independent of group assignment so whether the mice or cr or not what factors may be involved in extending lipan or extending at least median lifespan and that's what we'll see here so we've got various biomarkers some of them blood based others body composition based like percent fat and that's plotted on the y- ais this is in a log scale so the negative log p uh log 10p that's log scale and that's plotted against the adjusted life correlation so what that means is if the biomarker is to the right of zero higher levels of the biomarker are significantly associated or correlated with a longer lifespan and if the biomarker is to the left of zero higher levels of the biomarker are significally correlated with a shorter lipan so in terms of one of the biomarkers that's most strongly correlated with a longer lipan that's lymphocytes at 16 months old for the mice regardless of which which group they they that they were in which that they came from was significantly correlated with a longer lipan on the other hand the biomarker that was most strongly correlated with a shorter lifespan was an rdw when the mice were 10 months of age and as a quick aside the rdw is the red blood cell distribution width that's a measure of the standard deviation of whether your red blood cells are all one volume all essentially the same size or do you have a mix of very small and large red blood cell so the rdw is a measure of that variability in red blood cell volume sl size so having a higher rdw when the mice were 10 months of age again independent of which group they came from whether it's 40% cr or ad lib was significantly correlated with a shorter lifespan but these data are in mice so what does this have to do with people so interestingly the story and i know i said that that's not the fourth time the story is similar in people so higher lymphocytes are associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes acm risk and that's what we'll see here so on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio for all cause mortality risk risk of death for all causes plotted against lymphocyte counts and what we can see is that the lowest risk of death for all causes is when lymphocytes are 2 * 10 to the 9th per liter or 2,000 cells per microl ler and that 2,000 number is important because lymphocytes around 2,000 are more likely to be found in youth and lymphocytes decline during aging and i covered all of these data in an earlier video if you missed it it'll be in the right corner now the importance of the age related decline for lymphocytes is that relatively lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk as shown by the red lines so these data agree with the data in mice where relatively higher levels of lipocytes were associated with a longer lifespan or correlated with a longer lifespan similarly a high rdw is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk also in people which is what we'll see here here and on the y axis we've got the rdw value in percentage and that's plotted against all cause mortality risk in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one when the data is completely to the right of that hazard ratio of one we have a significantly increased risk and if the data is completely to the left of one we have a significantly decreased risk so in terms of what's associated with an increased all cause mortality risk we can see that all of the different colored shapes and there are three different colored shapes which means that the these models were adjusted for demographics in red for comorbidities in blue and then other blood labs in green so all of those different colored shapes we can see that their 95% confidence interval that's the horizontal line to the left and right of each shape that completely is to the right of that hazard ratio of one which means that when the rdw is greater than 13.7 that's significantly associated with an increased risk of death for all causes in contrast lowest risk of death for all causes for rdw is at relative lower values 11.4 to 12.5 as you can see that those different colored shapes are completely to the left of the hazard ratio of one so associated with a lower risk of death for all causes now there is one exception to these data and actually before i go there i should say the importance of relatively higher rdw being associated with an increased all cause mortality risk is that the rdw increases during aging and that too i've covered in an earlier video and if you've missed it i'll just me just mentioned in the comments and i'll point you to that video now there is one exception to these data and it's when the rdw values are less than 11.4 although this paper didn't specify how low below 11.4 as you can see that when the rdw percentile is 01 to 0.1 you can see that that's significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk but just to put that into perspective being in that rdw percentile range occurs at a frequency of 1 in a th000 and 1 in 10,000 people would have an rdw value back low in contrast again the rdw increases during aging with values greater than 13.7 being associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so that's more likely to be found during aging so these data in humans and in mice when considering that they are similar raises the question can we maximize our lifespan so translating the data from mice to humans can we maximize our own lifespan by maintaining lymphocytes rdw but also why stop there why can't we have as many biomarkers as possible possible be as youthful as possible can we maximize lifespan by optimizing levels of these biomarkers at youthful levels that's all for
