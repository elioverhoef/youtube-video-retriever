# Telomere Length Test #5 in 2023: Which Dietary Factors Are Significantly Correlated?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible so with that in mind what's optimal for t length and that's what we'll see here on the y- ais we've got tiir length plotted against chronological age and this is true diagnostics cohort so in youth we can see that tm length is 7.6 to 7.75 kilobases or kb and then it at advanced ages older than 80 we can see that tm length shortens to less than 6.6 kb or kilab so we can see that t length declines during aging and in terms of what's optimal avoiding an age related decline while attempting also to keep it relatively useful as close to 7.6 kilobases or longer is the goal so with that in mind what's my data so to address that i sent blood to true diagnostic discount link will be in the video's description and this is tiir test number five's data for august 21st of 2023 so it takes 4 to 6 weeks to get uh the data back once you send it to true di true diagnostics so i just got it a few weeks ago and with that in mind uh data for the october 2nd sorry october 9th test i'm still waiting on that as again it takes a few weeks to get the data so for tiir test number five it was once again 7.1 kilobases which if we look at the plot on the left would put me exactly at age expected based on my or what's expected based on my chronological age so not great as my goal is to have everything relatively youthful relative to my chronological age but there is some good news so for that how does 7.11 kilobases which is what i had for this test compare with previous tests and that's what we'll see here with tm length on the y- axis uh 2022 data on the left versus 2023 on the right so over three tests in 2022 average t length was 7.04 kilobases whereas in 2023 so far over the first five tests it's 7.13 kilobases now rather than looking at averages from year to year we can evaluate the these data to see if they're statistically different by using a two sample t test and when i do that we can see that i've significantly increased 2023 data relative to 2022 as the p value is less than 0.05 so what may be contributing to these data which factors may impact ti length so in my data the most likely uh factor is calorie intake and if you're familiar with the channel you've seen me look at correlations for calorie intake before after i get the data for every test i re-evaluate uh correlations to see what may still be significant or now is newly significant and then try to file that as best i can and i'll get more into that approach as we go through this video but for now the strongest one of the strongest correlations with t length is calorie intake in my data over the 8 tests so on the y- axis we've got tary length plotted against the average daily calorie intake and note that this isn't the average daily calorie intake on the day of the test this is from the previous the immediately after the previous test to the day before for the subsequent test in other words if there's a 60-day period in between tests i track my daily diet by weighing all my food i then log that data into chronometer discount link in the video's description and then because i know my daily intake the average dietary intake for that 60-day period corresponds to the latter test and for every blood test it then lines up with a corresponding dietary intake and i can then look at correlations and then attempt to follow the correlations with the goal of optimizing biomarkers towards youth and health so with that in mind the correlation for tm length with calorie intake we can see it's a significant inverse correlation in other words a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a shorter tm length in my data whereas a relatively lower calorie intake is significantly correlated with a longer tm length but calorie intake doesn't tell us much about which factors within the diet may be contributing so what about diet composition to address that let's first start off by taking a look at correlations for macro and micronutrients with t length and we can see here what we can see here are the nutrients that are significantly correlated with t length or in other words nutrients that have a p value less than 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance and note that i looked at uh 42 uh correlations for 42 macro and micronutrients and those that are on this list are the ones that had a p value less than 0.05 so i should mention that the r little r that's the correlation coefficient when it's positive that's higher levels of the nutrient are significantly correlated with a longer tm length and conversely when the value is negative relatively higher levels of the nutrient are significally correlated with a shorter tm length now note that these are unadjusted correlations as i mentioned calorie intake is significantly correlated with tm length which then raises the question are these correlations still significant after accounting for calorie intake and that's potentially important because if i have a relatively higher or lower nutrient intake in concordance with a higher calorie intake is it the nutrient or is it the calorie intake so by adjusting the models for calorie intake by including calorie intake in the models that look at correlations with tm length we can address that question so after including calorie intake in the model now vitamin b1 is just outside of significance with a p value of 0.06 similarly selenium is no longer significant with the p value of 0.11 and then total fructose has a p value of .12 so in other words after justing for calorie intake the most or the the variables that are most strongly correlated with t length are no longer statistically significant and if i went through the rest that are on the list they too wouldn't be statistically significant as if the strongest correlations aren't significant then the weaker correlations certainly won't be significant either so looking at macro and micronutrients is kind of a rough way of looking at diet composition as we attempt to reduce the uh you know the foods that we eat into you know these defined variables protein carbs fat etc so with that in mind what about foods how are foods related to t length at least in my data so to evaluate that i looked at correlations for 48 foods with tm length and the ones that are statistically significant again with a p value less than 0.05 are shown here but just like we did for the macros and micros note that these are unadjusted correlations so once again are these correlations still significant after accounting for calor intake so to address that let's start off by by taking a look at the correlation for poman cheese after adjusting for calories and we can see that model here so we've got the coefficient the beta coefficient on the left and it's corresponding standard error and then the p value and you can see that the model includes calories calorie intake and then after adjusting for calorie intake we can see that parmesan cheese's p value is less than 0.05 in other words after adjusting for calorie intake a relatively higher parmesan parmesan cheese intake is significantly correlated with a shorter tm length all right so let's do the next couple of foods lowfat yogurt after including calories in the model now we can see that lowfat yogurt also is not i shouldn't say also also in addition to the macros and micros just outside of significance with a p value of 0.06 so uh not not significally associated with tm length after adjusting for calorie intake for lowfat yogurt all right let's do one more uh cacao beans which i used to make homemade chocolate so i mix the cacao with uh dates med dates so after including calories in the model we can see that cacao be intake is not significantly correlated with t length as the p value is is just outside significance at 0.13 so for lowfat yogurt and cacao beans after adjusting for calorie intake they are no longer significantly correlated with tm length so with that in mind when considering that parmesan cheese is the only one of everything in this video that was significantly correlated with tm length after adjusting for calorie intake will will reducing it we we reducing my intake of it my daily average daily intake of it will that impact tiir length and to test that tiir length test number seven in 2023 is scheduled for the end of november and when considering it takes four to 6 weeks for the data to come in that video should be ready sometime in january all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buck aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic and tmia testing any quantification atome metabolomics or microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with sciox health including apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here in red that link and all the other links will be in the videos description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
