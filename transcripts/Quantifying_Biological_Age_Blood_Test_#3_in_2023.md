# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #3 in 2023

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed that's the central premise of this channel and with that in mind two weeks ago i blood tested for the third time in 2023 so what's my biological age so here we're looking at data using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own biological age using levine's test that link will be in the video's description so when using this test i get a biological age of 34.2 years which is 16 years younger than my chronological now note that for the 10th consecutive test quest high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 milligrams per liter and rather than looking at blood tests data entered into a spreadsheet screenshots of the blood test report will be included later in the video now in terms of weak spots where i can improve creatinine was higher than my average of 0.95 milligrams per deciliter since 2015 and similarly glucose is now in the 90s again for the second consecutive test so going forward i'm going to work on bringing those down and potentially not impacting the other biomarkers now note that this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and i have 28 blood tests over that period and that's what we can see here so from 2018 to 2019 i only tested three times with an average biological age using levine's test of 36.1 years then in 2020 and 2021 collectively i measured 12 times with an average of 35.6 years over that two-year span and then in 2022 over seven blood tests i significantly reduced my biological age using this test to 33.8 years and if you missed any of those videos they're on this channel so check it out and then in 2023 we can see that most recent tests of 34.2 years and thus far over three tests my average pheno age is 33.3 years so uh doing pretty well relative to 2022. Now this isn't the only biological age test that i use i also use aging.ai and when entering the 19 biomarkers that are found on aging.ai i get a biological age a predicted age of 33 years which is 17.2 years younger than my chronological and just like we did for levine's test this is only one test for more context let's let's take a look at previous data for aging.ai age which is what we can see here i have 40 blood tests since 2009 for aging.ai when i first started tracking over three tests over a five year period my average aging.ai age was 32 years and then starting in 2016 i started to test more often trying to get a more representative view of where my systemic biochemistry was testing 34 times over a seven year period so about five tests per year and my average aging.ai age over that 7 in your span was 29.8 years thus far in 2023 we can see the most recent test with that 33 of aging.ai age which is worse than the first two tests in 2023 of 28 and 27 years but note that 33 27 and 28 are still within my range of around 26 or actually of 26 to 34 years since 2016. So although it got worse it's still within my normal range and with that in mind in 2023 my average aging.aih thus far over those three tests is 29.3 years which is decent compared to the average of 29.8 years from 2016 to 2022. Now in terms of room for improvement glucose and creatinine are also on the aging.ai list but my triglycerides were higher than my average since 2015 of 58 and red blood cells were below my average of 4.85 so going forward those four biomarkers are front and center for attempting to improve them without affecting potentially affecting anything else now at this point in the video i then asked the question what may be contributing to these biological age reductions including diet and or supplements and that will be in a future video i've already got it ready to go so coming sooner rather than later but for now let's dig into the full blood test report now notably absent on this first page is homocysteine so note that i started serine plus vitamin b6 with the goal of reducing homocysteine and it was two grams per day of serine and 11 milligrams per day which was about three and a half times higher than my previous intake of about three milligrams per day for vitamin b6 and i supplemented with serine and vitamin b6 for 44 of the 49 days that corresponded to this blood test so i'll actually have this data in in the next video so did serine plus vitamin b6 reduce homocysteine and that will probably be midweek next week for page two notably absent is dhea sulfate and for that question did vitamin b6 impact the nad concentration my my blood levels of nad and correspondingly did higher nad effect dhea sulfate and i covered that in an earlier video why i expected that to be the case and uh fortunately ginfinity just got my blood sample two weeks after mailing it uh those those samples should be good for up to a month so i should have my nad results sometime soon posted first on patreon all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
