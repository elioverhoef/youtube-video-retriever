## Transcript

[music] aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so with that in mind if we trap if we track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind i uh measured my biological age or i got blood tested for the third time in 2021 and i've got those nine biomarkers listed right there and this is using using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a measure of biological age so just to run through it really quickly for people who haven't uh seen this before it includes albumin creatinine glucose c-reactive protein the percentage of lymphocytes mean red blood cell volume red red blood cell distribution with alkaline phosphatase white blood cells and chronological age so when entering into uh entering in all of that data my biological age comes up as 35.2 so when considering my chronological age is 48 and a half that puts me at 13.2 years younger than my chronological age so an obvious question that should arise is how good is this biological age calculator so here we're looking at the correlation for uh phenotypic age again as a metric of biological age versus chronological age and by the red line in the in the figure you can see that it's almost perfectly linear which means as close as you can get or getting as close to one a correlation of one uh or negative one but that's not applicable in this situation so anyways it's pretty close to one as it's as you can see on the left in two sep separate study cohorts in uh inhanes three the correlation for uh this biological age calculator with chronological age was 0.94 and in a separate study in in haines 4 it was 0.96 so very strong correlations for this biological age calculator with chronological age so another question that often arises is how does this compare with the best epigenetic clocks and uh the epigenetic clock that consistently uh is shown to have the strongest correlation with uh biological age is uh the horvath clock or a couple of different horvath clocks which is what's shown here so we're looking at epigenetic age on the y-axis plotted against chronological age on the x-axis and this is a composite of uh epigenetic age against chronological age for uh 16 different cell types so we're looking at that on the right so breast cells cheek cells cerebellum so brain colon blood skin etc so when looking at the composite measure for epigenetic age of those cell types against chronological age we can see also a very strong correlation of 0.94 so in other words when considering levine's correlations with chronological age and the best performing epigenetic clock uh from the horvath group we can see that they're pretty close to similar for their ability to predict chronological age so uh aging is uh aging data and being able to predict chronological age is interesting but uh how does it associate with disease risk or risk of death for all causes all cause mortality risk so what's shown here is all-cause mortality data uh sorry all-cause mortality data and for every one-year increase in biological age using levene's phenotypic age calculator we can see a nine percent increase all-cause mortality risk now that uh association is true whether looking at young middle age or older adults is shown there so again so older uh bio uh biological ages based on levine's test significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality now uh more specifically it's also associated with disease-specific mortality including an increased risk for heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease interestingly not cerebrovascular disease or stroke an increased mortality related to diabetes influenza or pneumonia related death and as a side note in a paper that uh morgan levine's group published last year an older biological age up to 13 years before the onset of the pandemic was associated with an increased mortality risk in covet 19 patients and then last but not least having an older biological age by levine's test is associated with an increased risk of death for kidney related issues including nephritis and nephrosis so levine's it's important to note that levine's test isn't the only blood-based biomarker panel that can easily assess biological age and all cause mortality risk and i'm sure this crowd already knows about it but just to run through it the other one that i'm going to show some data for is aging.ai in particular aging.ai 3.0 and that includes in contrast with the nine parameters on levine cess this includes 19 different blood blood-based variables and you can obtain them by getting the standard chemistry panel and complete blood count cbc so in in the us that's a relatively cheap it's about a 35 test uh and also note that the standard chemistry panel in cbc can also be used to to measure eight of the nine components on the beans test with the exception of high sensitivity c-reactive protein which is usually a separate separately ordered test which can cost up to about forty five dollars so for eighty dollars usd or less depending on where you get it uh you can do levene's test and for thirty five dollars usd you can get uh or you can do the blood test to calculate your own uh aging.ai age all right so uh aging.ai isn't as strong uh for its correlation with chronological age as beans test with a correlation coefficient there of 0.8 what about all-cause mortality risk so uh in a study that was published a few years ago by um the aging.ai group they found that biological ages that were younger that than their corresponding chronological age were associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and uh that's what's shown here so first they looked at a canadian cohort uh so for for people who had a five year older biological age relative to their chronic chronological age you can see they had about a twofold increased all-cause mortality risk and on the on the other side of that for people who had a uh greater than five year reduction in their biological age relative to their chronological age there was about a fifty percent or approaching a fifty percent decrease for all-cause mortality risk and these findings were also uh replicated in a u.s based cohort so again nhanes where we can see the same pattern so uh with this in mind what's my data and i've put all my data up here so anybody can double check my my numbers uh and based on my numbers for my for my test that i got done at the end of july we can see that my predictive biological age with aging.ai is 29. Now note that i'm close to 49. So this is about 20 years 20 year difference for my biological age relative to the chronological age now results for one blood test are interesting but data from many more tests can tell the full story and with that in mind i've been measuring um for blood testing for uh uh up to six times a year for a few years now and so i have data for 12 blood tests since 2018 where i can calculate uh levine's biological age and that's what's shown here so when looking at the different dates we can see my chronological hca my biologic biological age or phenoage and then the difference for my chronological age minus the biological age and as we can see when taking that average i'm about 12 years younger than consistently uh 12 years younger over that the last three year period so uh what about aging.ai so for aging.ai i have many more blood tests uh mostly because i just started measuring uh c-reactive protein just a few years ago so i wasn't measuring c-reactive protein uh you know early on so more than 10 years ago so uh in looking at 27 blood tests since 2009 as shown here on the left so there were two too many blood tests to to put up all that data so i just took the average for uh every year going past 2016 to 2021 and then from 2009 to 2013 i had three tests so i was testing about once a year uh and nonetheless we can see on the right my aging.ai average age and then the average difference for my chronological minus my biological age so notice that from 2009 to 2013 i had my lowest uh difference for ca minus ba around seven years but then in 2015 i started uh getting more serious about optimizing my biomarkers and optimizing my health in general so i started dietary tracking uh entering all of my uh you know weighing all my food entering all that data into uh an online tool that then gave me macro micronutrient data that i logged in an excel file and then i started to look at correlations between my diet and my blood biomarkers with the goal of optimizing the blood biomarker so my diet is completely driven by what i see in my blood so since 2013 when after which i started dietary tracking we can see that my average difference between micro chronological and biological age now i i was consistently 15 years younger and uh in three blood tests so far in 2021 i'm almost 19 years younger so i'm i've been able to uh get close to what uh biochemical youthfulness looks like so the obvious question should be what's contributing to this relatively low biological age so in terms of supplements i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my twenties so i have to take that so i've been taking levothyroxine for more than 20 years and then for the last blood test that i took in april uh until uh my previous blood test in july i was supplementing with methyl b12 to help reduce homocysteine and if anybody's interested in the why behind that i've got a video on my youtube channel so uh check it out so uh what about fitness so um i i should mention that i take the average value in between blood tests because that would be expected to correlate to the subsequent blood test so in between blood test number two and number three of this year um that 84 day period i weigh myself every day two in the morning my average body weight was 156.7 pounds which results in a bmi in the quote unquote normal range 24 and a half so nothing too spectacular there but then my resting heart rate rhr was 47 around 47 beats per minute and heart rate variability hrv was about 53 milliseconds so these are cardio cardiovascular based uh health related metrics and uh so then the next question should be is are these cardiovascular fitness metrics contributing to my relatively young biological age so uh i should mention this i wear a fitness tracker and i'm not sponsored to to promote them but i wear whoop and the reason that's important is because uh this is whoop data so instead of comparing my data against the general population we'll i'd likely see uh much larger changes i'm comparing myself against people who are already fitness minded uh so it's a more uh relevant comparison so here we're looking at average wrestling heart rate in beats per minute on the y axis plotted against age so 20 up to about 50 years old and what we can see is that a resting heart rate increases for both women and men women in red men in blue so uh resting heart rate increases from the 20 to 50 years old age range so what about my wrestling heart rate which was 47 uh so i'd be off the chart i mean if lower is indicative of youth i'd be this would be indicative of a relatively youthful wrestling heart rate so what about a low resting heart rate being associated with health or uh risk of disease uh you know all-cause mortality risk so that's what's shown here this is a meta-analysis of 46 studies that included more than 1.2 million subjects and we're looking at the relative risk for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against wrestling heart rate on the x and what we can see is that uh starting at 45 which was the lowest all-cause mortality risk as you go above 45 beats per minute there's an increase all-cause mortality risk so i'm at 47 right now so based on the aging data and based on the all-cause mortality data that would suggest suggest that this may be contributing to my relatively youthful biological age and there's a button there so why is there a button there so this is fitbit data and uh in agreement with the woop data um we can see that average resting heart rate does indeed increase uh from 20 up until about 50 years of age but then notice that resting heart rate then also decreases and uh data for the women in green men in blue so rested heart rate decreases during aging so is my relatively low resting heart rate uh indicative of youth and health or is it low because of aging so that's where another metric for uh cardiovascular health can come in which is known as heart rate variability so um heart rate variability is the defined as the variation in time in between successive heartbeats so what that verbiage means is you know when your heart uh heart rate is 60 beats per minute the assumption is it beats exactly one beat per second but that's not exactly true it may be maybe you know 0.9 seconds per beat one second per beat 1.1 so the average would be one second per beat but there is a variability uh in terms of the time uh that it takes for each beat and that variability is the heart rate variability so in this case for these you know three examples here heart rate variability hrv would be 67 milliseconds so uh how does in order to get more context into the resting heart rate story in terms of it being good or bad in my situation and potentially contributing to a relatively young biological age it's important to see how heart rate variability changes during aging and again this is whoop data so uh comparing myself again against other fitness-minded people so uh what we can clearly see looking at heart rate variability on the y-axis plotted against age and in this case it's up to 65 years as the maximum for the age range 20 to 65. So we can clearly see by the black line that heart rate variability decreases during aging now my average heart rate variability from my second blood test until my third for that period was about 53 milliseconds so that would put me uh close to the top of the range for my chronological age category uh or at bet or at best it it would put me at the low end of the range for it for 20 something 20 something year old so it was a as a relatively quick quick review for my uh resting heart rate and heart rate variability so uh my resting heart rate is relatively low in conjunction with a heart rate variability that is higher than the median for my age at worst or at the low end of the range for a 23 year old at best so when considering uh that a low resting heart rate and a high heart rate variability are found in youth and in contrast low resting heart rate but also a low heart rate variability are found in older adults to answer the question is cardiovascular fitness contributing to a relatively young biological age i'd posit that my data suggests that it's indicative of you and you know if if my heart rate variability was say 30 milliseconds as indicated there which we which would be below the median for my age range or chronological age then what could make the argument that a relatively low resting heart rate plus a low heart rate variability would be indicative of poor cardiovascular fitness but that doesn't seem to be the case uh at least for me right now and i should mention since my last blood test i've actually my heart rate variability for this uh for the past month or so since my last blood test is around 58 so i'm even better than i was uh going into my last blood test all right so what i haven't mentioned yet is diet how is diet contributing to my relatively low biological age so uh nad is involved in the health and function of virtually every organ system in the body and unfortunately for us it declines during aging now one reason for that is because of the age-related increase in a protein that degrades nad which is known as cd38 now uh there are cd38 inhibitors fortunately uh but for example epigenin quercetin luteolin and chromatin is shown there which can inhibit cd38 increase nad or uh slow the age rated age-related nad decline now note that these metabolites are found in food so by eating an abundance of foods that contain cb38 inhibitors potentially we can maximize nad thereby keeping us youthful for longer so with that in mind i'm going to take a look at some of my own data in terms of dietary cb38 inhibitors and whether or not they're correlated with my biological age now as i mentioned i've been weighing all of my food since uh 2015 but it wasn't only it was it wasn't until more recently that i started quantifying food intake uh so in 2015 i was i was tracking macro micronutrients but then i had the thought well i'm reducing food to its components but the fact is i should be tracking actual food amounts that i'm that i'm taking in so i've been doing that since july 2018 so uh you know since then i have more than 100 days of food intake that correspond to 16 blood tests during that time and that's what's shown here on the left so uh just to run through this approach real quick and if anybody wants more info i have a video on this too on my youtube channel lots of these videos on my youtube channel so check it out but notice the date so uh on july 10th starting at the top 2018 i got a blood test on that day so since i was fasted that day starts day one for the for the period that corresponds to my next blood test which was then on 8 21 2018 so from july 10th to august 20th i have an average dietary intake since i'm recording all of my food during that period that corresponds to blood test data and because i have enough dietary periods that correspond with blood tests i can then look at correlations between my diet with blood biomarkers so just going across the list for each of the four dietary cd38 inhibitors i calculated how much i was taking in on average every day for each of these four inhibitors and then sum them and then note that you know i had you know it's not all the same for my dietary cd38 uh intake you know in terms of my average daily intake i have a range of that you know 160 to about 390 milligrams of of these dietary cd38 inhibitors per day uh which should allow for some decent correlations if they exist now whereas epigenetic and corsetin are kind of the more pop culture way to inhibit cv38 and potentially raise nad in contrast about 70 70 of my dietary cd 38 inhibitor intake comes from coromanon and the major reason for that is because they eat a lot of blackberries and kermit is enriched in blackberries so uh with all this in mind is the sum of these dietary dietary cd38 inhibitors significantly correlated with biological age and or its component biomarkers so first looking at levine's test and i've got how many blood tests that correspond to dietary intake with the little n next to each variable so i have between 11 and 16 blood tests that correspond to the dietary cd38 data so first note that uh for the sum of the dietary cb38 uh inhibitor intake that's not significantly correlated with the overall biological age score so phenoage you can see that p-value is not even close to statistically significant but uh interestingly we can see that the higher my dietary dietary cd38 inhibitor intake is the lower my glucose levels are so that's a significant correlation but for whatever reason that correlation isn't enough to drive an overall reduction for a biological age at least using levine's test all right so what about aging.ai so um uh at least it's going in the right direction we can see an inverse correlation meaning the higher my dietary cd30 inhibitor intake that's correlated with a younger aging.aih but note that the p-value is not statistically significant so there's no significant uh correlation for my dietary cd38 inhibitor intake with aging.aih and note that glucose says glucose is also included in aging.ai we see the same correlation but then also note that the higher that my dietary cd38 inhibitor intake is that's correlated with lower levels of platelets and blood cells which is probably a bad thing because levels of platelets and red blood cells both decline during aging so that would be sending them in the wrong direction so one biomarker going in the right direction two going in the wrong direction uh but again this the net effect of those three uh biomarkers is not enough to affect the overall aging.iii aging.ai age uh in terms of its correlation with dietary cd38 inhibitor intake so when considering this data for the dietary cb38 inhibitor inhibitors that may not i posit that's not uh impacting my overall reduction for biological age so uh that's all i've got for now um i've just got posted here everywhere you know that i'm online so uh with that i'm ready for questions [music]
