# Resting Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability: 1,240 Days Of Data

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For each of my recent quantifying biological age videos i've also posted data for cardiovascular fitness related metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability so note that although these data correspond to a blood test i have a lot more data that goes back all the way uh to 2018 so the focus of this video will be analyzing year to year changes for both resting heart rate and heart rate variability so starting with resting heart rate i started tracking that uh in august of 2018 and this is data that goes through the end of 2021 so december 2021 and as you can see by the end i have 1 240 days of data for both resting heart rate and heart rate variability so starting with the data for 2018 we can see that my average resting heart rate was about 51 beats per minute 50.9 bpm and note that uh my fitness tracker and i wear whoop i'm not sponsored by them other fitness trackers can measure resting heart rate and heart rate variability similarly note that it records it automatically during the last sleep cycle which takes away the human error in quantifying this stuff myself so going from 2018 with an average resting heart rate of about 51 in 2019 my average was 48.9 and note that each of these circles corresponds to one day of data and then in 2020 i further reduced my resting heart rate to 48.1 and in 2021 my average daily resting heart rate was 47.4 beats per minute now we can evaluate whether these um wrestling heart rate values are significantly different from when i started in 2018 by using a two-sample t-test which is what i did and when looking at the p-values for comparing each year versus 2018 we can see that each year i was able to significantly reduce my resting heart rate when compared with the 2018 data and that's what's noted there so is the resting heart rate though going in the right or wrong direction so to assess that let's have a look at how resting heart rate changes during aging and this is whoop data since i wear whoop i think it makes sense at least to start to look at um whoop users to compare me against other whoop users into in terms of aging related changes so resting heart rate increases during aging for both women in red and for men in blue and i'm only going to focus on the data for men as that directly applies to me so we can see that age-related change there for men with values of a little bit below 54 beats per minute for a 20 year old that increased to above 56 beats per minute for a 50 year old and note that this chart only goes from 20 to 50 years old so for my chronological age based on the population average i should expect to have a resting heart rate that's greater than 56 beats per minute in contrast my resting heart rate for 20 21 was a little bit above 47 beats per minute so by extrapolation on this graph i could posit that my resting heart rate may be indicative of youth also i've resisted the age-related increase for resting heart rate at least that age-related increase that goes from 20 to 50 years and there's a but in this story so is the declining resting heart rate indicative of cardiovascular aging so why would i think that so whereas the whoop data goes from 20 to 50 years this is fitbit data and this is published and i'll put the link to this paper in the video's description so we're looking at average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age and although the age range goes from 20 to 50 it also goes from 50 to 85 so it goes beyond the whoop data so in agreement with the loop data we can see that resting heart rate increases for both women in green and for the men in blue up to 50 years old and then after about 50 we can see that resting heart really resting heart rate then declines all the way up to 85 years old so how can we know if a declining resting heart rate is indicative of better or worse cardiovascular function and evaluation of resting heart rate in conjunction with heart rate variability can help assess overall cardiovascular fitness so what is heart rate variability just as a brief introduction to that so it's defined as the variation in time in between successive heartbeats so what that means is the assumption is that when with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute is that the heart rate beats exactly one time per second but that's not true there's variability in that in that how often that the heart beats so it may be uh 0.9 1 1. 1.1 seconds and that variability is then calculated as the heart rate variability so in this case as shown by the picture here the variability for the time in between beats was 859 793 and then 726 milliseconds and when calculating the heart rate variability using the rmssd calculation you get a heart rate variability of 67 milliseconds so what's my data and again i uh the loop tracks both heart rate variability and resting heart rate so i have data that goes all the way back to august of 2018 and this is more than 1200 days of data so when i first started in 2018 my heart rate variability variability was 47.3 and i should mention too at no point was i sedentary during any of these years i've always been physically active back in 2018 i was walking at least 10 to 15 miles a week as to get to work it's a one mile walk each way so walking at least two miles a day every day or at least five days a week so getting up to 15 miles a week including walking on the weekends plus regular strength training two to three days a week at least an hour each session so with that in mind my rest my heart rate variability in 2018 was 47.3 i was able to increase that to 56.2 in 2019 i increased it further uh and again this is the average daily heart rate variability so each you know 365 days of data the year year average so increase it increased in 2020 to close to 58 milliseconds and then it had a little bit of a dip in 2021 somewhere around 52 milliseconds and then when comparing each of these years against 2018 using a two-sample t-test we can see that each year was significantly different from 2018 so each of the years 2019 20 20 21 were each significantly different and significantly higher when compared to 2018 and that's what's noted there so let's take a look at how heart rate variability changes during aging to put these data into more context and again this is whoop data so we're looking at heart rate variability on the y-axis plotted against age and in this case for some reason their data goes up to 65 years so when looking at the high end of the range as noted there for men and the data for women in yellow is very similar so in youth heart rate variabilities at the high end of the range can be as high as about 110 110 milliseconds that then get cut in half in 65 year olds to around 60 milliseconds similarly the median value goes from about 80 and 20 year olds to somewhere around 40 and 65 year olds and at the low end of this range values of about 60 in 20 year olds dipped to less than 30 in 65 year olds so based on this data it should be pretty clear that heart rate variability declines during aging so for my data for the more than 1200 days of data that i have my average heart rate variability is 54.3 milliseconds so to answer that question how can we know if a declining resting heart rate which is true in my case is indicative of better or worse cardiovascular function when considering that my heart rate variability over this three plus year span is above the median for my age the median here although i haven't indicated is some uh indicated it is somewhere around 42 milliseconds for my age group so when considering i'm above that um one could argue that my cardiovascular function has improved since 2018 resisting age-related changes for both resting heart rate and heart rate variability now if the resting heart rate reduction that i've experienced over that three plus year period was in conjunction with a relatively low heart rate variability for example below the median for my age so below 42 that would suggest worse cardiovascular function so having a lower resting heart rate and relatively low heart rate variability would suggest worse cardiovascular function now it's not all sunshine in my data as you can see my data from 2019 and 2020 was much higher than 2018 and my 2021 data is significantly below the 2019 and 2020 data so this shows that i definitely have room for improvement so uh 2022 is potentially a big year will my data continue to get worse from 2021 or can i reformulate my exercise approach to get back to the data in 2019 and 2020 in 2022 all right that's all for now uh if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
