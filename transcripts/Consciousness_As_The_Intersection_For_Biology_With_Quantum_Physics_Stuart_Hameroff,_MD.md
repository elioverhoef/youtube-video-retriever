# Consciousness As The Intersection For Biology With Quantum Physics: Stuart Hameroff, MD

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey everyone today we've got dr stuart hammer off stuart is a professor am meritus that's essentially the uh the yoda of the department in the departments of anesthesiology and psychology and is the director of the center for consciousness studies at the university of arizona today we'll talk about the penrose hammer off theory orc o or orchestrated objective reduction which describes consciousness as the intersection of biology with quantum physics then how does this apply to aging alzheimer's disease and even things like life after death and i've got a whole bunch of other questions so with that first welcome steuart thank you michael nice to be here all right so i think i think before jumping into the aging relating related stuff i think it's important to uh go over orc o and what it is and uh microtubules and quantum effects and how that links with consciousness right well most people would say the brain is a computer of simple neurons a complex computer of simple neurons that interact by synapses and uh these complex interactions synapses give rise to emerging properties which include consciousness happying at a high level of complexity uh i think that's because if you look at a single cell like a parium it's not an onoff state it's a well i hate the word that use use the word complex because it doesn't but it's a it's a it's a it's its own thing it it runs it swims around finds food finds mate has sex can learn escapes from capillary tube faster each time uh why is it doing all those things and how does it do all those things it uses its microtubules structures inside all cells including our neurons that are protein polymers of a protein called tubulin so they're hollow cylinders of a lattice so imagine like an ear corn and you hollow out the beginning uh the inside all you got the kernels making a lattice and imagine they could talk to or communicate with each other like little switches like little synapses that's what microtubular do except they do it much much faster than neurons they do it actually multiple frequencies from hertz to kilohertz to megahertz to gigahertz to terahertz so down in the optical range they're actually interacting with photons and uh they're in all of our all of our animal and plant cells including our brains our neurons and where they're in particularly interesting arrangements and uh they process information at single cell level so why wouldn't they be processing information in our brains particularly when we don't have a better idea for where memory is stored they store memory uh they perform cognition and in alzheimer's dementia microtubes fall apart alzheimer's is focused on these stupid ameloid plaques uh which are ugly but outside the neuron and may or may not have anything to do with the cognitive dysfunction there's some correlation between them and uh what are called neurofibrillary tangles inside the neuron and those do correlate with cognitive dysfunction and those are are clumps of a microtubular associated protein called toa that stabilizes the microtubules and for whatever reasons as we get older the towel falls off or the microtubules destabilize and then the towel falls off so you get clumps of towel the microtubules disassemble the neuron shrinks you lose synapses you lose memory you lose cognition and the and your whole brain shrinks you've got alzheimer's and they're spending billions and probably trillions of dollars on these stupid ameloid plaques somebody's making a lot of money on drugs that don't work and are toxic and it's the stupidest thing i've ever heard uh uh micro you could treat the microtubules and i've been trying to do this study at our institution uh but i couldn't get any cooperation uh by resonating microtubules with something very simple and inexpensive nonivasive called ultrasound which is used for imaging on newborns in in or fetuses in the uterus and newborns through their fountain look for bleeds and has been used in medicine for 100 years safely at low intensities it's it's painless if you put it into your brain you actually get a nice buzz and feel good for a while and we did a pilot study where it improved symptoms and alzheimer's and uh i couldn't get any cooperation and i think that that should be done you can do this with a low intensity handheld ultrasound device for about 150 bucks and uh i my dream i'm getting kind of old now but i is to go around the nursing homes and go to every room and try it on somebody and see if they'll wake up kind of like that old movie uh about parkinson's i forgot what they called it awakenings with robin williams but this would be if you repeat it it would would be permanent or or could be and i think it's worth trying um so that's my main thing about longevity yeah so wait i i wanted to get into the alzheimer's story later later on but i wanted to go through how quantum quantum effects are happening in the microtubules and how that potentially is the interaction between the quantum world and then what we perceive as the you know the relativistic world right well so uh i got interested in microtubules when i was in medical school in the early 70s in a cancer lab studying mitosis how cells divide and the and the the mitotic spindles which are made of microtubules pull apart the chromosomes and everybody else in the lab got interested in the chromosomes it was the dawn of the genetic revolution and genetic engineering and so forth they all be probably became billionaires going into genetic all that stuff i found that really boring and uh i was interested in how the microtus knew where to go and what to do that they had some kind of intelligence or consciousness and i had been interested in consciousness since my undergrad days and was in medical school was always oriented towards uh the brain uh neurology neurosurgery psychiatry um but none of those lifestyles grabbed me so i i did some research and really got intrigued by microtubules and to make a long story short i uh i did an internship and during which i was going to to figure out what i wanted to do and i met the chairman of the anesthesia department at the university of arizona bernell brown who was i told about my interest in microt tubules and consciousness and he said well if you want to figure out consciousness figure out how anesthesia works because we don't know and number two here's a paper by a friend of mine that shows that anesthesia depolymerizes microtubules i said well that's cool and he said uh and it's a lot of fun you'll make good money so i said okay so that was 40 49 years ago i just retired last month from anesthesia after almost 50 years and uh i really enjoyed every day of it it was it was really you know it was grueling it was intense it was sometimes exhausting but it was fun and uh uh the camarad with my friends and my colleagues and so forth but anyway i moved on and i'm now doing purely research in astrobiology where we're looking for the origin of life and consciousness in the early solar system but getting back to your question so um i i was going so i i got the idea that microtubules were processed information as little computers like every of the the kernels in the corn could be like a bit switching in mega megahertz so a lot of information uh in fact the singularity people were saying well the brain has 10 to the 11 neurons switching with a th000 synapses and 100 hertz that's 10 the 16th operations per second and ironically there's about a billion tubulin per neuron switching at 10 megahertz which gives you the same 10 the 16th operations per neuron per second so i was going around to neuronet and ai meetings being a real pain in their ass saying wait a second your goalpost is like 11 orders of magnitude further downstream you know you're not going to be there in five years or whatever and even if you did you know anyway uh one day somebody said that to me they said okay let's say you're right we had did have all this information processing how or how would that explain consciousness how do microt tual computations produce consciousness and i was kind of stunned and realized that was a good point i didn't know and uh for ely he suggested i read a book by roger penrose called the emperor's new mind which argued for a quantum effect and he argued through girdle's theorem that um uh in girdle's theorem a mathematical theorem can't prove itself you have to be outside the theorem you need a conscious mathematician so he said to understand something to know it's true you have to be outside you have to have something outside the system and that has to be quantum physics because it's the only thing outside of classical physics and then he tied it to a collapse of the wave fun in spacetime geometry bringing in general relativity by then i was pretty blown away and i'm thinking this guy is the smartest guy i've ever read i mean he is so all over the place but so logical so clear and the his artwork and cartoons explain everything so beautifully i said i really don't know but i got a hunch he's right and uh but he doesn't have a good quantum computer in the brain i for quantum you need something that's going to be in quantum superposition of two states two or more states at the same time it's one of the mysteries of sorry of quantum mechanics how come that happened and he said that happens because he brought a general relativity and he said so you know einstein had this thing about uh spacetime being curved so if there was this a star behind the sun the starlight would be curved by the sun and we'd see it uh during eclipse even though it was behind the the sun and uh or can only do it during eclipse and edington did the experiment proved them right showing spacetime curvature edington got his nobel prize and celebrate with uh einstein who already has had his but roger applied this curvature to uh tiny particles quantum particles so that if a particle was here it'd be a tiny curvature here and if a particle the same particle was here it'd be a tiny curvature in the opposite direction so you you could and he used these these drawings of two-dimensional spacetime sheets with little curvatures that started to separate when they were in super position and uh and then you can imagine that if those separ ation continued you get many worlds you get multiple worlds it happen again and again and that's one of the explanations for superposition that there's no collapse there's no reduction they just keep separating and bifurcating in and we have an infinite number of overlapping universes which seems kind of wasteful and silly but it's a it's the uh most popular idea because it doesn't violate standard quantum mechanics doesn't really make any sense but it doesn't seem to bother physicist it the the math works but roger said no the separations are unstable and will collapse to one or the other at a time t and when that happens that causes consciousness so let me back up because the the other possibility is when you had a superposition that consciousness out there causes the collapse the conscious observer looks at these separated uh spacetime characters and instantly somehow it goes to this one or that one so consciousness out here causes collapse putting consciousness outside the universe or outside of science roger said no the separations are unstable after time te will collapse to one or the other and produce a moment of consciousness so it was and i i think still the only suggestion possibility for a scientific mechanism for consciousness otherwise it's all hand waving emergence and i liter literally hand waving uh i did when i was um my in the 80s i i spent a lot of time with a a good friend who was emergence non-linear dynamics person alin scott he wrote a great book about consciousness and emergence called uh um steroid to the mind kind of like the lead zeppelin song in fact i gave him that gave him the title from the lead zeppelin song so uh steroid of the mind and so you have layers and layers and then you get to consciousness okay that's fine but you need bottom layers now they're just talking about emergence up here without any bottom layers so it's i think it's all it's all when they say that unless they have a bottom layer which has to be the microt tual so anyway uh uh i read roger's book i said i wrote him a letter and said said uh you need a quantum computer in the brain that can control neurons and i think it's microtubules and i uh told him sent him a paper i told him about a book i' had written and by the way i was going to be in england for another conference i'd be happy to come to oxford he said please do so uh i think it was roughly october of 92 i met him in his office in oxford and uh he was very pleasant very polite very charming and uh he told me he was going to a meeting in in cambridge with uh uh philosophers of mind uh dan dennett and pat churchland both of both of whom had gotten wind wind of his quantum idea and didn't like it at all so he was happy to have something biological to to at least mention or i thought well he didn't say that but um anyway uh i so i did most of the talking i uh i went through a book i had written and showed him all the pictures and his first question was these are not simulations these are real biology i say oh yeah and uh at the end of the several hours where i did almost all the talking he thanked me very much he said thank you very much and uh we shook hands and said goodby and i thought wow that was cool i got to meet roger penrose and uh little did i know that was just the beginning so uh two weeks later i was back in england and i was having dinner with a friend and he said i went to this conference in cambridge and roger penr was talking about you and your stupid micral and uh that was a real thrill and uh shortly thereafter i got invited to a meeting in uh in sw sweden north the arctic circle just for scientists no audience including roger and we got to know each other played a lot of pingpong went hiking at the midnight sun and went skiing actually the midnight sun and uh became friends and i invited him to uh the first tucson conference in 94 and uh uh bribed him and his wife vanessa with a trip to the grand canyon afterwards which they gratefully accepted and uh we hooked hooked up we met in in denmark a few months later and started working on our our theory so uh that's how it got started um uh we were working on a manuscript trying to quantify microtubules and orcar and collapse the wave function it was going very slow but then uh we got a tacked in print by pat churchland who wrote a very uh obnoxious uh sarcastic uh paper attacking us and uh uh the journal the the journal said we respond in in the next issue if we had a manuscript in two weeks well we had been working for a year without a manuscript roger's wife excuse me roger's wife told me i have to be very patient working with him because he's very meticulous everything has to be precise and he's there a lot of things going but this annoyed him to the point where we we put it together we and we answered uh within two weeks that was our first paper and then the full theory came out a year later so he was ridiculed uh by everybody immediately the brain's too warm wet and noisy blah blah blah have to be in absolute zero temperature blah blah blah and my first reaction was uh and so was rogers well biologies had billions of years of evolution to figure this out and uh the main way that we figured it out is how anesthesia works because everybody says okay the brain's too warm wet and noisy okay wet so the our bodies are 70% water our brains are 70% water cells are 70% water but the other 30% uh includes a lot of other uh solubility compartments as an anesthesiologist we give i give a drug and i and where's it going to go in the body so most drugs you give intravenous or you take pills they they get the bloodstream they're charged so they're very soluble in blood or water and they go to receptors on on surface receptor on membrane surfaces anesthetics are are like oil oil and water don't mix they don't dissolve very well in water very very poorly or in blood so when you breathe they do get in the blood and they quickly leave the blood to find something fat-like something oil likee that includes membranes and includes the interiors of proteins which have aromatic amino acids like tryptophan phenyalanine and tyrosine which all have quantum optical effects photo optical photo electric effects where you hit it with an ultraviolet photon you get an excited state it's a quantum state tools wrong and then it drops fluoresence and uh we've done experiments now showing this happens in microtubules and that anesthesia dampen this but know i'm jumping jumping ahead so um an i thought anesthesia solved the problem of too warm wet and noisy because inside the uh the the non-polar regions of proteins where these aromatic rings are it's oil- likee it's not wet at all in fact they it excludes water they're hydrophobic and uh in microtubules these non-polar aromatic uh pathways of it's called p electron resonance the pi orbital of the aromatic ring is continuous from along the tubul and then from tubul tubulin so you get these py aromatic pathways that go the length of a microt tual which could be meters in your sciatic nerve uh or shorter in dendrites but u mesoscopic if not macroscopic and that solved the problem if they were oscillating coherently like a laser which it turns out they are and uh this was discovered later by our friend honor ban bop working at the national institute of material sciences in japan uh doing really the cutting edge the most edch stuff in the world and he started looking at quantum oscillations and microtubules and tubulin and found these uh coherent oscillations that repeat every three orders of magnitude in microtubules so e okay people look at the brain and measure eeg and we get these squiggly lines and they're supposed to tell us something and they're between zero to 40 hertz or maybe 100 hertz cycles per second and uh uh but it but if you look deeper uh with different me methods you see the same sort of patterns not just in hertz but in kilohertz thousand hertz megahertz a million hertz gigahertz a billion uh terahertz a trillion and even faster every three orders of magnit and honor bond calls this the microtubules act as time crystals time crystals were described by i think frank wilch and physics but nobody had a clue that they could happen in biology and honbon discovered that micro those are time crystals and he recently uh just published his third paper on measuring megaherz and gigahertz from the scalp uh buried in the eeg so the eeg is well known he calls it the dgg do decograph for 12 orders of frequency inside the brain so uh next year will be the 150th anniversary of eeg and i think it's right for a revolution and i think uh that that that this will keep going uh uh we're going to be doing well involved with studies that honor bonds organizing in india over in a hospital over the summer where they're going to measure this as patients go under anesthesia and see if the megahertz goes away and um so i think uh this is going to change everything and uh uh if it's not suppressed i mean people our opponents have been actively suppressing discrediting saying we're crazy and blah blah blah and i'm kind of getting fed up with it and uh now that i'm retired i don't have much to lose so i'm fighting back and know sounds funny on twitter in a lot of other ways but uh it's going to be interesting next couple years i think the uh the mainstream in the neuroscience of consciousness you know there's two two groups or two uh conferences our group the science of consciousness which is kind of broad spectrum we include quantum we include parapsychology if they have evidence psychedelics uh spirituality near a about experiences if they're well presented but also rigorous brain science the other the other group assc only considers what i call cartoon neurons this goes back to kristoff kooch at our first conference in 1994 he had been working with francis crick whose idea was the brains a a complex computer simple neurons and he showed a picture of quite literally an empty neuron just the membrane a cartoon neuron and i said kristofh why don't you look inside for the micro microtubes is already there's all this other stuff going on and uh he turned to me and he said stew in my in my the persona of my favorite cowboy western act actor clint eastwood i'm going to answer a man's got to know his limitations and that's apparently a line from magnum force and he was being funny and cute and it worked because it kind of caught me off guard i was back on my heels i didn't follow up with like you know how can you even believe this cartoon neuron thing and it was click it was cric's legacy and the cartoon nuron has lasted 30 years and led assc into a pitiful situation i think where they're selling out to ai uh because ai i mean these cartoon neurons are no different from ai so if the c neuron theories are right ai ai has to be conscious inevitably and that's what they're saying so they having these debates now and they're concluding well compared you know if these current models uh global neuronal workspace iit higher order thought pc all of them they're based on cur if right then ai has to be conscious therefore we've surrendered so go ahead ai so ai being smart and wanting to control everything i think and particularly the narrative that ai can be conscious because that would make it more that would make it easier for ai to control things like the government and religions and things like that so they're pushing this narrative and the the cartoon neuron people are playing right into it they've just thrown the brain under the bus i mean there's if it's all just a computer there's no biology it's it's kind of sickening actually okay no no no no no that was all great you checked off a whole bunch of stuff that i wanted to go through anyway so good so so i too am in academia and i see this often where you know at every level you've got a normal distribution of intellect and uh performance that goes with that and sometimes you'll have scientists who you would expect that are uh should be the most open-minded right you know data driven uh and open-minded to what that could infer right but yet they're so regimented in their ways that they refuse to uh to look at you know outside ideas even when they're well supported like yours yours and rogers right so um then they hold on to those ideas like they marry them as tightly as they can and hold on to them for the next 50 years now not anyway that with without trying to without looking at things with an open mind so it sounds like with the cartoon neurons and not considering m microt tual in this whole equation seems like a lot of science is like that and as you mentioned you're literally fighting back i see you on x and i think it's great i mean uh i think more scientists should do this and you do it in such a well-respected respectful way usually i lose my temper sometimes well i mean there are so many people coming at you sideways too with all kinds of like uh ill intentions and you handle it beautifully that and i've always tried to model myself in that same way not knowing that you're doing that too but uh look you know how it is like to break a paradigm it take you've got to break some eggs and sometimes it may take generations for the for the field to catch up to where you guys are right um it's funny because when you said when you read roger stuff i wasn't familiar with your work at all i think i saw you on like tim ventura and her chongle and you open my mind and i'm not an astrophysicist my realm is physiology and biochemistry so i wasn't even thinking about um you know quantum physics as it applies to consciousness so um anyway all right so question right so so we know that microtubules have there are quantum effects going on in microtubules but then how does that link with the collapse of the wave function to i guess create consciousness in the brain is that what's what's happening yeah so consciousness you know quala uh phenomenal experience has to come from somewhere it's it and you know darwin wrote a lot about consciousness but he didn't include it in evolution because he didn't have a mechanism you know it wasn't an enzyme it wasn't something that could do anything it could see so we haven't really had a a scientific explanation for it and accordingly like in the the most the 20th century or 19th century uh or no sorry the 20th century it was deemed uh uh taboo in psychology they wanted science they wanted data you can't measure consciousness so behaviorists took over for most 20th century and consciousness was thrown out it was banned and then in the late uh like in the 1980s it kind of kind of uh it kind of come back uh due to books by francis crick um gerald adman and roger penos and even dan dennett who a philosopher but the first three guys all won nobel prizes uh and i think crick was completely wrong about the his astonishing hypothesis that the brain is nothing more than a a pack of neurons at computing kind of weird the guy who figured out dna has such a listic view view of consciousness but anyway that was it and he latched on to kristoff who was an upand cominging neuroscientist and they became uh a team and uh and uh about the time that just before actually roger and i became a team actually uh pat churchland uh invited me to uh uc san diego to i thought give a talk and when i showed up there was no talk it was uh sitting around a table in his her office with francis cri kristoff and kristoff k and her grilling me about microtubules for two hours and crick fancied himself as biologist as so did uh kristoff and uh i i was kind of i i was prepared to give electure i had slide and everything and they're just like asking me all these questions about microt tuia see if i see what i knew i guess and uh at the end after two hours pat says you know you bore up rather well so i'll take that as a compliment but she's been on my ass ever since nonetheless yeah like pompus right pp what a pompous jackass to you know when he when he came at you with that line from that movie too it's almost like he's coming from this uh intellectual privilege where he thinks that you're just not quote unquote good enough to be in his realm which is seemingly ridiculous at this point right so well he he does get a lot of agulation or he has so maybe maybe that's what happens right i think his but he's been wrong he's been wrong on everything okay he was wrong about gamma synchron he and crick came out and said 40 htz is the neuroc coral of consciousness believing that it was due to spikes so as you know neurons have in integrating fire and and uh they kristof's always maintained that the fire rings are the bits which gives you the computer i've always thought the consciousness has to be in the dendrites you integrate or orchestrate you have a collapse you have a conscious moment and that triggers the the spike to do what you're going to do about it to speak or to move or do it you know so the the spikes are just carrying out are like me message boys messengers so that's what i've thought so okay so he's wrong about so he thought that gamma synchrony was due to spike so he was for it then he finds out that gamma synchron is due to dendritic synchrony so he was against it so 19 1990 cck and coke were for gamma syn 1995 they came out against it because it wasn't spikes so spikes were the thing in his books he always says how else can you mediate kind without spikes well microtubules that's out in dendrites so and then then of course uh iit he latchs down to iit which uh has flamed out uh i'm glad to say uh 125 neuroscientists said it was pseudoscience actually their reasons they're they're the cartoon neuron people who claimed that iit was pseudoscience because it didn't even have neurons not even cartoon neurons it's just information there's no there's no biology in i whatsoever so i think that needs to be put to sleep uh one way or the other and uh recurrent processing in predicted coding is actually i think probably right but it happens at multiple levels including the level of microtubules so it's not really a mechanism of consciousness it's a mechanism of biological information processing at all levels and there's been a lot of really great work uh in the neuroscience of consciousness in the last year from earl miller's group at mit finding these uh uh uh eeg uh feedback waves going front of the cortex to the back that seems to correlate with consciousness and it meets incoming and if you put an oddball in the incoming uh the odd ball gets selected if everything's as as expected as predicted nothing changes so i think predictive coding is probably right but it happens at a at a much deeper level um the the other theories are all cartoon neuron theories or or just pure information theories so um we've done uh you know we we made some predictions uh that uh we could demonstrate quantum effects in microtubules at ambient temperature and that they would be inhibited by anesthesia so we were part of the templeton world charity foundation uh adversar collaboration program that you may have heard about where i guess it was five six years they identifi five theories five five major theories and they wanted us to do adversar collaboration take two theories against each other pick out a experiment that would refute one and prove the other one well the other the other theories are all c level of neurons and so it wasn't a very good fit we tried to come up with something with iit and we had kristoff and julio come to tucson uh but they wanted to the experiment we eventually did uh of a uh uh fluoresence of a microt tual on an optical bench with canceling out any vibrations with lasers perfectly aligned we eventually did this showed quantum effects showed they went away with anesthesia they wanted us to do that in the brain of an awake monkey and then put the whole monkey to sleep i'm going no i'm not going to torture monkey and it's going to be impossible to do and uh no so uh and they said well okay uh too bad so uh they went on to spend $5 million u in a uh in a inconclusive study with u global neurona workspace and templ gave us 100,000 to do one experiment which we did and it worked and it worked beautifully we showed quantum effects and we showed they away with anesthesia in the meantime a lot of other work honor bound's work and work by travis kraic has shown um uh a correlation of anesthetic effects on microtubules that correlate with their potency in putting people and animals to sleep so uh i claim and i think it's true i haven't heard anybody refute me that our theory orco has far more explanatory power and i can go through everything you know all that uh connection to biology because they don't have any connection other than cartoon neura and experimental evidence and uh they don't have anything and but they just continue to ignore us and uh uh i don't get it but anyway uh it'll take some time i'm getting old i hope i'll last long enough to see it yeah so so what happens so microtubules within the context of alzheimer's disease dissociate to falls off you lose cognition as you mentioned earlier right but um with aging does that happen independent of alzheimer's disease where the microtubules will dissociate without having alzheimer's disease i think so probably i i just i just uh googled something in preparation here and uh i found a paper about uh where well i don't want to go find it i'll lose you but uh about uh uh microtubules and longevity and uh it was in animals and they looked at the uh the state of the microtubules as a function of the longevity of the animal or the other way around and they found a correlation so i didn't get a chance to study it but i'll look it over and i'll send it to you yeah that would be great then the other side is uh when when considering that um microtubules are linked with cognition and i think i saw in one of your presentations you posted a slide of the density of microtubules in the brain uh based on species right with hum oh yeah yeah the number the total number basically based on i i i getting the information here and there yeah and you know so in our theory uh uh uh conscious events occur at time t equals h over e subg so h is plank's constant e subg is the gravitational self energy of superposition pulling something apart from itself so with the sun well the sun's not in super position but but uh one uh uh one atom nucleus would be fairly small amount uh that's e subg so uh that would take a very very long time to reach collapse so one atom take a million years something like that uh for something large it would happen very quickly so biology you want it to happen at the range of phys neurophysiological effects so in our original work back in the uh mid 90s we thought well that must be like gamma synchron 25 milliseconds so he said t equal 25 milliseconds we soon realized that's a long time to avoid decoherence and uh number two that's not very many microtubules it's very few actually almost too few so um but we thought well it could happen faster and more likely happen faster like in at 10 megahertz which is a a resonant frequency for microtubules and uh if it happens at 10 megahertz then you would need a lot more tubulin in superposition uh 10 to the 15th so and they would need to be entangled and that seemed like a big ask but now hbond has shown entanglement between microtubules and in the non-polar regions i don't see why they couldn't be if they're oscillating uh coherently um but the other but the other problem was that you know our cognition consciousness it doesn't happen that fast 10 megahertz you know most people would say we have epochs like visual scenes cals roughly 100 milliseconds so how do you get from very fast 10 megahertz events to fairly slow cognitive epochs and uh roger and i revised our our paper in 2014 and we talked about this and uh we had talked about interference patterns and he said well it could be negative resonance or interference from the very fast uh going down and down and uh and that's exactly what honbon uh has shown these uh time crystal behaviors with repeating patterns every every three orders of magnitude so we said okay well there's interference and that's and that's how you get down to it's kind of a downshifting and actually the work of earl miller in mit and demetrius patus and others uh uh has been showing this downshifting is very important so in feed forward from the back of the brain to the front of the brain you go from very fast to very slow and in the cortex you go from the top of the cortex layer one and two down to layer five where the paramal cell bodies are and that also goes from fast to slow it's in gamma synchrony up at the top at the apical dendrites but as you go down towards the the paramal cell body you get down into alpha so you're going from roughly 40 down to down to 10 and i think that's also an interference pattern and it's kind of like you're you're select you're u uh you're continuously or repeatedly focusing in on something you're you know there each little collapses and you're and you're getting rid of more and more un un unnecessary stuff and eventually you get to the solution the conscious moment the decision that you want to make you collapse on that and that's your reality and then it happens again and again and again so that's what i think's going on but that's it that's faster than millisecond uh time scales that is but but then you get to the epic so if you get to uh yeah so when you get to the uh the 10 or 100 milliseconds you're down to a very few number of tubulin but that's all you need at that point i think if you got the right you got rid of all the unnecessary stuff all right wait so where i was going with the slide with the uh microt microtubular density or based on species with humans at the top and i think at the far right you had like maximum human computation ability right so that that implies there's going to be a range that people have to maximize their cognition potentially by could is it possible to maximize microt tual density and to resist any age related decline has anyone even looked at that or is that a even a thing well you you do want to keep your microtubules healthy that would be the main thing yeah i don't know if you want to increase your density i think may b you know at this point you want to keep the ones you got healthy and uh you know we see seen these pictures of aliens with big heads so maybe they got you know 10 times as many microtubules who knows but we got to get there first so uh you know the main thing i think is to is to keep your microtubules healthy and one one way to do that if you have a problem is with ultrasound as i was talking about before but uh i'm sure all the vitamins and nutrients and everything else that healthy people take probably do that also well plasma pardon me i was going to say plasma levels of tryptophan decline during aging so that's probably not contributing that's at the core right so yeah yeah we want more tryptophan and uh you know tryptophan is the uh the aromatic amino acid with the indo ring which gives you which has the highest energy uh highest excitation energy in fluorescence so that's why uh and it and microtas absorb u uv a lot and there's probably uv in the uh in the cell for mitochondria and so you want to take care of your mitochondria too a lot of people think it's all about the mitochondria and maybe to some extent at least it is but they uv photons which are uh very readily absorbed so for another added added advantages you're getting rid of potentially toxic metabolites or toxic radical radicals that way if you uh so um it's it's it does two things uv i think fuels the the quantum processing the microtubules and the microtubes by soaking them up by get rid of any uh negative effects all right so you mentioned the uh ultrasound as a potential alzheimer's therapy but on the other side of so ultrasound is what 20 20,000 hertz could you is it possible to have like uh i don't know if there more like y megahertz actually well anything above audible yeah which i think is 20 20,000 hertz up to several uh millions of hertz is is ult is uh ultrasound so um when honbon discovered that microtubules had uh coherent oscillations in these different frequencies kilohertz megahertz gigahertz terahertz this is back in about 2010 um well he he published on i met him in 2009 so it was it was around there i started to think uh maybe we could treat the brain treat the microtubules with oscillations with one of these frequencies so kilohertz that wasn't interesting megahertz in electromagnetics is radio waves and i wasn't interested in putting radio waves into anybody's brain uh gigahertz is microwaves i wasn't interested in that ter terz is uh photons and that's pretty hard to get in although people are trying to do that but if you go back to megahertz i looked over and there is an ultrasound machine and i which we use in anesthesia all the time and to to image looking for the jugular vein or do nerve blocks or whatever and uh i'm thinking i wonder if anybody's tried megahertz ultrasound into the brain for mental effects so i looked it up and there actually was a guy at asu just up the road from us jamie tyler who had been looking at ultrasound into rats and putting electrodes in them and looking at behavioral effect so you know he could zap the right motor cortex and make this pal move and stuff like that or cause physiological effects of course you couldn't tell how the rat was feeling with it but i also found out that it was approved for brain imaging before you know ct and mri made it obsolete for that and was still used to look at newborns for bleeds through the font where there's no skull at all and so i fig well can't be that harmful you know we put it everywhere you why not the brain and it doesn't seem to be a problem so and we had a a pain clinic and uh with a lot of the patients are depressed as you might imagine i used to run the pain clinic and i knew that and uh i said why don't we try this on our chronic pain patients who are depressed and see if they get better maybe their pain will get better maybe their depression will get better and they're kind of laughing at me yeah yeah right hammer gu well tell you what uh your idea you got a shaved head go right ahead we'll watch and so they call my bluff and um so at the end of end of a long day in the o we're sitting around the table and i said okay here we go so i you put this goop on and i i held it up to my head i didn't know where else to put it i knew that this is a thin area of the brain and i was kind of watching myself on the screen you can actually see the the temporal pole and the cortex and i held it for about 15 20 seconds and i didn't feel anything so i was really disappointed i put it down i said oh well but about a minute later i started to get a buzz and i was kind of high for an hour i mean it was the end of the day i was going home fortunately but i felt really great and uh i said we got to do the study and we did and published in early 2013 it was uh the first the first study on uh ultrasound effects on human mental states or mental states at all it was published in the journal brain stimulation a good journal and uh and so a lot of people start doing ultrasound but they but ultrasound can be focused and if you use tdcs or or tms you can't focus it ultrasound you can focus like a like a laser beam on any part of the brain and so people go say oh we can stimulate the hippocampus we can stimulate this stimulate that so that's they went off in that direction and i thought well why are you bothering because it's going to spread out anyway and all you're you're affecting microtubules so people you know so most of the work since then has been done in in in uh focus and also high intens if you do it a really high-intensity focus you can zap a lesion so if you got a a eg seizure focus or tumor or pain focus maybe you can zap and get rid of it by burning the brain i don't want to do that at a medium doses you can open the blood brain barrier to get drugs across it wouldn't get in i don't want to do that either low intensity without heating the without heating at all you don't do anything except who knows resonate microtubules although people in the ultrasound don't want to believe that they think it's it's activating stretch receptors i'm going well how does that do anything so anyway it's controversial there's a fair fair amount of lab stuff showing microtubule effects directly on microtubules but um it's still controversial most people would say it's stretch receptors but i don't believe so so i was thinking the opposite side of that equation in terms of uh so not excitation an excitation frequency is it possible to have sound induced anesthesia right couldn't the i mean maybe you generate a an interference pattern that basically damps down the microtubules just like chemical anesthesia wood is that even possible it might be uh my friend j sanguinetti who started doing a lot of focus ultra sound was looking he said well if you if you ultrasound here it's inhibitory if you're ultrasound here it's excitatory and uh i never quite believed that uh was anyway we have good anesthesia we don't need ultrasound for anesthesia what we don't have is a treatment for alzheimer's so uh whether it could be an an i mean people are using tms for anesthesia i think tanon patented i'm going why we got really good anesthetics you're not g to put i'm not going to put that damn thing on my patient's head and have to worry about that crap i mean why we have really good anesthesia so i don't think we need better anesthetics purp fall is great c flin's great the drugs are great um we don't know how they work and uh and we don't know how to fix the brain when it's broken that's what i'm more interested in yeah gotcha all right so when considering the quantum effects and microtubules uh so when i hear quantum effects i start thinking about entanglement is that entanglement local to the brain or now we talking about entanglement of processes happening in the brain that are linked to somewhere else who knows where else so what what what is what do you have to say yeah good question um first of all uh i think we need entanglement in the brain just for things like uh cognitive binding spatial temporal binding so uh visual images start on the you know b1 the back of the brain move forward and they go through associative cortex and you add shap color motion meaning and when it gets here you got the whole picture it's a blue bird or it's a red kite or it's a silver airplane it's not you know something flying with silver and this and that so it all comes binds together despite those different features being processed at different places and different times in the brain we don't see different time we see one thing so there's spatial temporal binding so not just spatially but temporal uh which which entanglement can do so i think we need that just for normal brain function and we need it for uh uh zero phase leg gamma synchrony eeg at the high frequencies where it's perfectly synchronized over the whole brain that's really hard to explain by traveling membrane potentials and even e fatic electrical electromagnetics because that that drops off with with distance very rapidly so i think we may need entanglement just for normal uh spatial temporal binding and uh and definitely for orco for for all those tubulin to be uh to be entangled in a one so that you have one one uh one collapse at of at every 10 mil uh uh at 10 megahertz so uh but you're asking uh a different question and uh so we have this this image of a hierarchy going from the neuron in herz to faster faster faster faster uh we get to where anesthesia works and the terahertz and pedah herz and we keep going faster and eventually we get to the plank scale the u you know it's a big step the last step is you know because it's uh for 43 herz 10us 33 cm but you know roger's idea connect would suggest that these processes quantum processes happen in the microtubules go all the way to the plank scale and that where the qua i mean and the plank scale is in here it's everywhere i mean you don't have to go for it it's it's right there um it's just at a much much much smaller scale but once you get faster than u you know 10 to the 18th hertz you're smaller than matter and you're faster than biology so it's probably non-local there and so you know like uh in your death experiences when when the the brain uh stops getting oxygen and uh you know blood stops flowing eventually at some point the quantum information in the microtubules uh kind of dissipate to the universe but stay could stay entangled as kind of a soul so you could have an aob body experience near-death experience aob body experience the patient is revived they go back inside they say oh it's floating floating above you know um or they don't they're not revived and they we we don't know but there's a a lot of pretty good evidence for reincarnation actually when you you hear these interviews of these kids who have memories and then they have birth marks that correlate with the way the person died this and that so until we know that consciousness in the brain is strictly local and uh classical we cannot rule out non-local consciousness outside of the brain how you in fact uh i'm now thinking that uh consciousness would preceded life uh i'm now working in astrobiology with my friend dante loretta who uh was in charge of this nasa mission to an asteroid to bring back organic molecules and he's been interested in the origin of life his whole his whole life his whole career and uh he he was assistant uh to the this director on this big project dante was fairly but the guy got uh mike drake unfortunately got sick and passed away and dante at a very young age took over and um it went great and the the samples came back uh last september he was there i watched it on tv and so we're analyzing the samples now so anyway while he was waiting he had promised he told me he had promised you know to to uh unveil the origin of life so how was he going to do that based on these molecules and he got the idea that evolution would make a lot more sense in terms of the behavior of primitive creatures just moving around doing stuff if they had some motivation and there were no genes so maybe they were conscious in a primitive way right from the start right from the origin of life feelings something feels good so i'm going to do that you know why am i going to go here it feels good why am i not going to go there it feels bad simple stuff like that and he said i wonder uh if anybody else in the world has had this crazy idea and he went to google and found me and uh i was right across the street and he we didn't know each other and he said who the heck is this guy so uh he emailed me and i said well that sounds interesting so we met and he told me his idea and i well he saw a paper i wrote called the the quantum origin of life did the brain evolve to feel good which basically suggests that roger's objective reduction which gives qua gives feelings occurred in the primordial soup which had these aromatic rings um we know that from the simulation of the primordial soup and there's so i suggest in this paper that there started to be conscious moments in the primordial soup with these molecules my cells they're called and ar raay of molecules and some of them at least occasionally would feel good would be pleasurable and that would provide a feedback fitness function for uh these my cells to proliferate to develop to self-organize to optimize conscious to sorry to optimize pleasure and that was that was the original life that's what i i suggested and then and even evolution it's evolution is a lot easier to figure out if there's pleasure you know why would anybody do anything for their genes if their gene you know the uh dawkins is idea uh uh gene survival if genes don't have feelings why would that matter it doesn't make any sense it's see uh so i it's tey logical and and so i think pleasure from the start is probably the most logical thing which means means consciousness was there uh before life and how long before life well who knows well in the self assembly molecules that had aroma aromatic rings that could uh i basically capture quantum moments or maybe uh i don't know i don't know how you would how that you know what you know what i'm saying so well yeah so this is also interesting because these aromatic rings are floating around the universe stars uh young stars produce uh you know aromatic hydrocarbons not just you know benzene like goes in our gas tank but complexes like gra little bits of graphine we have ring complexes in planes but also uh bucky balls and ferin and uh the uh carbon nanot tube ferin where you have a cylinder of aromatic rings that geometrically looks a lot like a microt tual and uh we're we're uh i can't i can't say too much about it but we have reason to believe that uh suspect that microtubules were present way earlier than evolution would have indicated and uh i'm not that's all i can say at this point because it's it's almost too crazy but we do have some evidence we're going to follow up on it so uh which means that maybe the only way that that could be i think is that u these fullering nitudes might have themselves started having conscious moments and kind of beefed up and became biological in some way at some point and they were the origin that these uh nanot nano nanoes became microtubules as the starting life kicking off life so when i've heard you talk about uh consciousness ex existing outside of life i mean uh that suggests that it's not bound to any structure right so that's not that is what you're saying or that's not what you're saying it could be in spacetime geometry right i mean which doesn't have structure it's spacetime i mean it puts in the in the realm of general relativity rather than classical physics or quantum mechanics and uh it's hard to measure that that kind of stuff as it is hard to measure consciousness you know the i think the only way to do it and i don't know if this is possible but in principle the way they measure gravity waves you know with these mile long lios in perpendicular and which look a lot like centrioles which are made of microtubules but um that'd be probably too much to hope for but um so yeah i think it's more the in the realm of uh gravitational waves that are so tiny that only quantum you know aromatic rings or electrons can can detect them i i don't know but um yes they can happen in spacetime geometry without any matter uh due to space uh spacetime curvature and and yeah and plus there is some matter floating around there even in the vacuum but yeah you could uh the idea is purely space-time geometry could have separations and collapses so how would we know if we're tapped into if there is a consciousness that exists outside of brains how would we know that we were tapped into that and we weren't just staying local within what's inside of our own well that's a good question you know uh i kind of think that when we go into meditative states or altered states or uh are just uh feeling good or intuitive that we tap into platonic val platonic information embedded in the universe and uh you know roger brought up these platonic values in his books and then i probably pushed him too much and he kind of backed away because it it sounded too religious or too spiritual which he tends to avoid but i think that uh these platonic values that influence the collapse which is not uh completely which is not random nor algorithmic but influenced by these uh platonic values could be something like you know the way of the dao or divine guidance or or something like that uh it's not religious i think it's just physics but pretty spiritual yeah maybe so are the are is the uh are the the quantum effects are the frequencies that are in microtubules are they different like for example during sleep during the different stages of sleep versus when being awake like is is there a is there a differential tuning of microtubules yeah on differential states well we we don't really know yet but we hope to know soon um we know that if you just look at eeg under anesthesia everything slows down the gamma goes away and everything kind of slows down we're thinking that uh in honbon just today publish paper on megahertz and gigahertz eg and we're planning studies this summer uh it's going through the ethics committee now at two hospitals in bangalore in india where his colleagues are going toh try this megahertz on patients going under anesthesia and we'll see if it goes away i'm hoping that the megaherz and the gigahertz will be far more sensitive uh than than eeg i i think they will be and then and it could be a monitor for def of anesthesia not that we necessarily need that but but it would we also they also want to try it in comos patients and see if there's any signs of and see what that shows so there's all kinds of possibilities so um uh this is just brand new stuff and uh i'm hoping that mainstream labs will start doing it i'm talking to a few but uh i think that'll happen and is this people are going to have to do it just to rule it out to show we crazy and i i don't think they're going to they're going to be able to do that all right so do microbes have microtubules or they or or do they have structures similar to microtubules like uh for example gut bacteria or skin bacteria you know do they have microtubules where so yeah good all animal cells and all plant cells have microtubules proar pro carots and uh ary bacterium have a different protein polymer that is is very similar but doesn't have tryptophan it just has phenyalanine and and i think tyrosine so uh yes they can have conscious moments but they would be kind of dumb compared to ours they don't have the high the energy of the tryptophan they're starting from fen alanine i see i see so then there's this balance right because they're probably about half microbial and half human genetics there's this balance between the dumb consciousness in microbes in our gut skin everywhere else versus the you know the trip defend uh focused you know consciousness i don't know about that i know i know the gut bacteria people think that that they're and maybe they are but i don't think i don't know that they're entangled i don't know if they're entangled with each other or with us and uh so i'm um i worry about the consciousness in the brain it certainly can be elsewhere i know when i used to do cardiac anesthesia and uh we did heart transplants that the surgeons would tell about patients who had never danced a day in their life they got a heart from somebody who was a big dancer now they're dancing so maybe there's memory in the in the gangle in the heart i don't know i mean that's not a scientific proof of anything but anecdotal but a lot of that stuff does happen and i i think memory is encoded in microtubules where else could it be because synaptic proteins last hours to days and memories can last lifetimes so it can't be in the synaptic proteins and uh the the microtubes and dendrites in particular are perfect because microtubes and all other cells when it's time to divide they have to disassemble so imagine a microt trib lattice is encoding information kind of like a mosaic and then okay time to divide it disassembles they all kind of jumble up and they reassemble you've lost it neurons don't divide so once those dendrites uh and then they get fro they get capped on both ends so they don't treadmill they don't lose from one and add from the other or what's the other thing dynamic and stability they're they're quite stable and each tubul so there's about a billion tubulin per neuron and each tubulin can have at least 30 different states uh genetic postranslational phosphorilation state and we've shown how memory can be coded through an enzyme called cam k2 from synaptic calcium coming in encoding on the microtubules so um so there's a billion to the 30th power of possible memory states in one neuron so multiply that times 10 to the 11th or whatever but i think you know we want a lot of redundancy we know memory is distributed it's it's not in any one place so we want it to be repeated over and over again and uh it's probably in the microtubules all over the brain so uh we got some resilience there but eventually you know when the microtus fall apart you lose memory gotcha all right some random questions is that hopefully okay so i think i think in most i don't think i've ever seen you ask these questions so and they're going to be totally random but like what's fun for you outside of studying consciousness and microtubules and astrobiology like what do you have favorite m mov can you even watch movies because most of them are just too you know bal and boring and you know so what no i love movies and i love sports i uh i'm a huge basketball fan universe of arizona wildcats i have great tickets i've been going i've had uh seats since well before lud olsson if you know in in in the 70s i had season tickets and and i'm in the second row behind the visitor bench i'm there almost every home game you can look behind the visitor bench and see me and uh i you know i love my my dad was uh kind of a sports addict and a gambler fortunately i didn't get the gambling bug but i i got the sports addiction so if there's a game on i'll have it on i may have it off the sound off i turned it off when we started because i didn't want to be distracted i'm watching the euro cup and uh the golf and whatever is on i love sports and i used to be pretty athletic i've got pretty pretty severe arthritis all i can do now is hiking in pickle ball i might i might ski my legs are okay my my right shoulder's pretty bad um but i'm in decent shape and uh i used to be pretty athletic and um i was kind of guy who was decent at everything not great at every at anything uh baseball was probably my best uh sport but um i still love sports and i i love culture i love people i love everything i love hiking around here i live in a beautiful area i'm looking up at the mountains here and it's too hot today to go uh hiking but as soon as we're done i'm going to jump in the pool and my son and his family are coming over for father's day and he's cooking and i'm looking forward to that and uh so hang out with other their kids and uh what you know watch sports and just relax so all sports what about uh like uh mma or ufc do you follow that stuff too a little bit i don't know it's a little too violent for me i i i love muhammad ali i saw when i was a kid i well i can't remember exactly when but he he was my hero but from the boxing point of view from the you know the both yeah yeah yeah i met him once philadelphia he used to just hang out in the street corner and uh yeah he was just i just liked his vibe nice all right so favorite movies do you have genre even a yeah genre that you like i kind of like humphy bogar movies uh i kind of relate to him for some reason uh um you know i like action thrillers i like you know movies like contact or deep impact and even armageddon although it's kind of corny um so i like anything really but nothing stands out where it's like this is my my movie i'll watch probably my favorite movie is the big labowski uh and uh i watch the godfather anytime it's on i learn a lot from that movie uh not that i want to be like them but how other people are and i recognize it when i'm getting muscled and uh so i watch that and i watch a lot of i'm looking forward to uh house of the dragons coming back today uh you know that show yeah i'm not no i i know of it but i don't i don't watch it okay so i like that so i like stuff like that all right so also uh i think you retired i like travel excuse me i love to travel i just uh and one one of the things about this whole whole deal has been it's gotten me to see the world and when i first started an anesthesia my future chairman said it's it's a lot of fun and and he was an academic uh he he introduced the anesthetic seo florine in the american market and figured out halane hep toxicity so after i was in the department for years he all kind of disappeared started traveling all over the world and uh i realized you could do that and so i' i've gotten to see the world a lot just through the research so i love to try love to go places i just got back from the how the light gets in festival in wales which was really a blast and i'm going to another festival in july in barcelona uh the a festival of consciousness and we'll be doing our conference the science of consciousness as a leadup to their festival next year so barcelona has always been one of my favorite cities i'm going to take my son and uh and he he wants to go deep sea fishing and i want to just sit on the beach and uh we're gonna have a good time nice all right so you were in academia for 49 years i think you retired earlier this year or going well i retired from anesthesia but i'm still in i'm still at the university of arizona and i've changed colleges but i'm in astrobiology astrobiology and may change it to astrobiology and astro consciousness we're uh we're thinking about that nice we got find it first gotta gotta what first we got to find it first all right find signs of consciousness in these molecules yeah and i i writing today i'm writing we're writing work on a proposal how we're going to do that nice if we get collective oscillations kind of like microtubules in these molecules then we're going to see if they go away with anesthesia and if they go away with anesthesia proportional to the potency the poent of the different anesthetics and putting you or i or any animal to sleep then we'll claim that this could be the roots of consciousness and maybe consciousness was there at the beginning of life there quantum effects would have to be a part of that story right yeah that's what we're looking at quantum quantum effects right so if you've got molecules and you've got quantum effects and you've got potentially consciousness that goes back to where is that entangled particle where is the particle that it's entangled with if it's an isolated molecule and not a giant body right or a brain well what one particle yeah uh one particle would take a long time to collapse so you need uh you need uh like a my cell of a complex and some of these my cells get pretty big and you get a lot of aromatic rings so you need a lot of them and they would have to be uh unperturbed for appear to to have the conscious moment or they could be floating in space where they're in ice where uh exposed to uv and it happens that way uh i'm not sure there's a lot of possibilities and uh i think uh n uh nature found a way somehow all right and then advice for young scientists like what what would you offer up that's one and then two is if you could go back in your career are there things you would change now granted the things i wouldn't say the things that have led you to where you are now but the things that you would change uh basically offering other young scientists advice and then young uh advice in your own career um you know those two how would you address that well uh as far as adv advice to young uh uh scientists particularly neuroscientists i uh i'm really worried that uh i mentioned the two groups in in consciousness studies the assc which is following the cartoon neurons which is heading into a big suck up to ai uh versus our group which is more open-minded and uh i think ai is funding a lot of research now in the cartoon neuron labs because all of a sudden they're advertising oh we have post dos available we have this and that available come come work with us blah blah blah and this is only i think only happening to the you know it's happening at at the cartoon so i think they're going to suck a lot of uh uh young scientists into uh dead ends with these cartoon neurons for example uh kristoff k and dave chamers and julio tanon just uh uh you know promoted the hell out of iit which thought was the stupidest theory i've ever you know it just it's pure information could be anything a thermostat could be you know it just there's no biology at all and uh and then uh you know when uh there was this letter from 20 125 neuroscientists saying that it was pseudo science pseudo science uh i said well i i kind of have to agree you know and then dave and uh chamers and ton and kristofh gal oh you're ruining the careers of all these students who've been working on blah blah blah and going no you ruined their career by touting a bunch of that they spent years working on don't blame me so uh i think that's happening uh on steroids now if uh the cartoon neuron people get sucked up into ai and it's all going to be about brains equals computers and forget about that all that other stuff string theory i guess is had some of that same problem right for the past 50 years or so i seeing theory yeah well even uh i don't know how old you are but before that it was uh remember the super conducting super collider all the physics physics people went into that it was going to build this big collider in texas billion trillion dollars and then they canceled it so i don't know what happened to those people i guess they went into string theory and now they're unemployed and or they went into chaos and emergence theory and now they're unemployed i think all these things are fr fruitless yeah so so the masses usually follow the the wrong approach and don't know that they're following the wrong approach right it's just it may be a limitation of the game i think they're following the wrong approach and i think they're going into a dead end and they should wise up all right so what advice would you give to your younger self you know i' i' i've sometimes wondered i got an offer to do research when i was still in medical school in um in uh uh at penn in a a very prominent biophysics lab uh by britain chance and uh i was at the end of medical school i wanted to move out west i didn't really want to do what he was doing which was mitochondria and uh and then i thought i could have done a phd at other times but i don't think any any phd i could have done would have taken me where i am because you know they were all following convention you know if you do that you got to do nih and you got to uh you got to uh uh write what nih wants to hear you want a project that fits within their guidelines not too risky and so i think i think we've really we're really losing our uh innovation competitive edge and and uh i think a you know knuckling under to ai and conventional this and that so uh i'm not sure i would i would change it it's been a rocky road in a lot of ways but i've had a good life i can't complain nice it's a tricky road right because if you've got a great idea with some preliminary data you know you may get a a group of scientists who review it who aren't outside the box thinkers and don't see the beauty of it because they're con thinkers and then it doesn't get funded and then what do you do then right so i'm actually thinking about leaving academia i've been in in this for you know 2003 i got my phd uh i'm just tired of reviewers reading you know three paragraphs and i' i'd like to think i write well you know uh three paragraphs of my grant and then saying uh we're not interested in how gut can impact muscle the gut muscle axis and mean meanwhile 10 years later there is a gut muscle axis right so but i had to deal with the reviewers who again you know it's not as you know groundbreaking is the stuff you guys are doing with consciousness but it's still within my own little niche so uh yeah so i'm thinking about leing academia i'm tired of dealing with viewers that you know uh lack find the right spot i mean i i lu out tremendously because i i wasn't sure what i was gonna do when i finished anesthesia i knew i want to keep going in consciousness and i and uh you know i ran into dante and and it really fits so uh i i looked out there and he's become a really good friend and he's a very smart guy and very capable he's much much better at organizing and grant writing and administration than i am and that was big weakness of mine so i i never i never ran a big lab you know i was good in the operating room and i was good in thinking and and and theorizing but uh i wasn't good in in organizing too much although i organized the tucson conferences which have turned out to be really great but nice all right so is there anything we didn't cover that we should have covered uh what does orco ar get wrong is there anything that it gets wrong is there a flaw that needs to be addressed that hasn't been addressed yet i don't know you know we we don't know what spacetime is it actually is roger's the world's expert and he doesn't know it's twisters or spin networks or or or quantum gravity or loops or we don't really know but and some people think it's not fundamental like don hoopin saying well you got to go deeper and deeper well maybe you do but getting to the plank skill would be enough for you know for me at this point uh the other question is uh rogers also went to uh uh what was there you know the origin of the universe he thinks the big bang was preceded by another eon which had another eon and we had a ser we've had a series of eons going all the way back and it wasn't a big bang it was more like a big brush fire and the this eon will end and then there'll be another one and uh so was there consciousness in the previous eon who knows i mean it it's kind of like now the consciousness is embedded in the fine scale structure of the universe in spacetime geometry that was ro one of rogers brilliant ideas and if so uh maybe uh you know when the uh the eon ends and there's a new eon that there's some it's kind of like a a mutation and evolution that the the the str the u the uh con the constant cosmological constant the 22 numbers that make up the universe might evolve and mutate a little bit so the nexton we more suitable for consciousness to optimize consciousness i mean what else would be the purpose of the universe other than optimized consciousness i don't know um that's just something that we we've talked about uh we're kind of far enough out on enough limbs that we don't have to talk about that now but uh it it's interesting that the universe may consciousness may be eternal and somebody at the you know uh uh scott arenson the quantum computing guy yep brilliant brilliant guy uh we've kind of tangled a few times and uh i i i said that at at the uh how the light gets in festival and he goes oh so we're going to have this loop oh no i said he said well what if you go all the way back all the way back all the way back when did it start and uh i i wasn't sure i should have said this but i said well maybe if you go all the way far enough back in the in in the in the past you wind up in the future it was kind of a joke um but he took it seriously okay so you have this big loop how you gonna prove that loop i'm going i don't know scott let's talk about over beer so um uh who knows what started at all good stuff yeah i don't who who knows right who knows if we'll ever know right ah that actually gets back to the reincarnation uh issue so if there if that is possible why doesn't everybody have a reincarnation experience why is it in this very small literally very small minority of people on of the billions that are on earth right how do you reconcile that how do we know everybody doesn't wouldn't we wouldn't we have that experience in some way i mean would you have to people people who have good stories uh forget them forget them as they grow older so maybe we forgot them in in the in in the uterus or maybe you know it wasn't traumatic maybe you only remember traumatic things so could cryonics be a death sentence in terms of frozen forever not allowing if there is a quotequote quantum soul i think as you put it is that like a frozen in carbonite like han solo and you're not allowing whatever that quantum is to leave well microtubules don't like being cold they deize so uh we had a session on that the 2014 conference on the future of consciousness we had this cryo guy and uh basically he said well we have to choose between preserving the membranes and preserving the micro the microtubules and so cold is a way to preserve the membrane i said okay well there goes consciousness forget it well he didn't like that very much but i haven't heard much about cryogenic since and i wouldn't i certainly wouldn't do it yeah so that doesn't leave many options for those those of us in the longevity community who have no interest in death and uh cryonics may be out and don't want to be buried in the ground and be worm food right so i guess it's like uh you know i uh i used to worry about that too and uh now i'm be i i really think that there is quite a good likelihood for consciousness after death and uh if it's really in spacetime so i' stopped worrying about it so that that that's almost uh brings us into the psychedelics realm so dmt right so uh uh are those realms somehow a different are microtubules somehow different under psychedelics whether the frequency that we want to study that and my friend travis kratic has looked at micro psychedelics binding to microtubules and find that they do and we think that they increase the frequency of the oscillations so if you go back to that hierarchy uh i think that would so anesthesia makes it slower uh and uh psychedelics would make it faster so there's more conscious moments per second so if you think of that other we'd move into the so we we'd move from maybe 10 million conscious moments a second up to whatever the max was i forget the total 10 of the 20th tubulins in the brain so there is a lot of room to go higher faster more conscious so then t i mean it's almost like we're tuned into a different frequency of the universe then potentially we go to a higher frequency yes yeah huh um so could it is that could that be a real realm i mean people under dmt exper experience to see all kinds of crazy stuff elves and all kinds of other you know so what do what are your thoughts about that could be archetypal images embedded at some level of the universe yian archetypes uh platonic values uh something like that interesting i think you know in that experience they're real i mean they they seem as real as you seem real to me right now and uh they probably are cool all right well i think we covered it all happy father's day enjoy the day with your family and thanks stuart ciao thank you michael good meeting you take care bye bye
