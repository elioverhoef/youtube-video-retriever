## Transcript

Hey everyone today we've got chris man lumis back on the channel for episode number three uh you know chris man in case you missed episodes one and two i'll link to those in the right corner so what do we have today chris what's on the agenda so uh thanks again uh for the opportunity to be back it's always great to talk to you mike um uh we've got three things i think we can talk about today we can talk about uh the unaging system which i'm developing um some recent uh hard news for me at least about uh fasting and my latest research into that and then last i thought we would talk about um my disastrous summer and uh how you should take care of your skin not doing what i did so i think those are the things we've got to talk about today all right so the unaging system so this is more of a cardiovascular marathon hit training so why don't if you could detail what theo so first of all what's the backstory on that and then what's the goal and then if you could tell us about the people that were involved so basically you ran like your own little study and then go through the results so basically from start to finish so yeah telling us all about it thanks so um so after i did the marathon uh which i talked about in our last podcast um i was talking to one of my friends of mine who's um not as uh not as fit hasn't done as much a younger guy and uh he said that was really impressive i'm inspired i'd like to do something thing um but i don't know what i still get out of breath walking up a single flight of stairs and um it was funny for me because i've been like well i've been talking about how to live your healthy life what are the exercises you should do what makes the most difference for longevity for a few years with this uh this friend and others and yet they really hadn't quite understood where they could step into it to to start the thing or what they should do so after talking to him i thought okay well i'm going to put together program and a system and uh actually help people to be them best their best selves and the thing that i've always focused on very closely is how to get the most benefit for the least time because um if you're a a multi-millionaire living in your house trying to optimize your longevity it's easy to spend an hour every day doing exercise in your own personal gym right no names named um but for most of us it's hard to find the time to do these things but i've been working to find what is the what are the key components of exercise that would enable you then to be able to do spend less like an hour and a half total time in a week and still be able to add 20 years to your life so um and i realized that uh just writing a blog about it saying you should you should do high-intensity mid training you should strength train you should uh walk more um you should eat the right foods and stuff wasn't really getting across to people because it's kind of like a everyone honestly knows that anyway right um it's not a mystery that you should be exercising but lots of the advice out there is much more general so instead i decided to actually put it into a system and say okay we're going to build lifelong habits that will make you healthy today and live longer tomorrow and we're going to build them in such a way that it actually helps you to build those habits as part of your life so it's not just um sort of like a thing that you're thinking about or you do it for like a week and then you have the next thing so you stop doing the previous thing so uh i'm designing a a one-year long plan um right now i'm in the testing phase as you mentioned so i have uh 15 uh friends here who are doing it with me friends and acquaintances and uh we've already finished the first three months of it uh the first three months of it i called the cardio kickoff and um actually all 15 of them were able to finish it and it's uh it's really inspiring because they're at all levels of fitness um one of the things i had at the beginning is okay have you cardio trained before have you done high-intensity interval training hit um and we had a good mix of all kinds of people some people like my friend who had difficulty climbing a set of stairs had really done kind of nothing um uh had done no uh consistent work and so it was uh set up a a community for it so we had a chat channel that we were talking about i set up spreadsheets to track it other people could see sort of how the thing was going and uh people could encourage the the other people and uh we found it to be very important to first of all have tracking so everyone who was in the program got themselves some kind of a uh quantitative watch or something that would then tell them how are you doing what's your resting heart rate what's your v2 max an estimate um all the wearables have an estimate right um what's your uh heart rate variability and so then we use that to go throughout the entire um three-month period of the first cardio kickoff to track and see okay how is it going and even before that um people were starting to realize first of all in the first month it was quite hard um as i said only an hour and a half a week but um an hour and a half a week of uh some hard exercise is still quite hard and um some of them were surprised that it was hard i'm like it's hard for me too like if you're doing high-intensity interval training it's maximum effort and my maximum effort is no easier than your maximum effort it's always is hard so it was a challenge for the first week of it but um let me share sort of the some of the the ways that how it went for people so for instance here we've got um this is in the very first uh a comparison between uh the heart rate this is taken i think by a garmin and he's doing high-intensive inal training so this is uh one of the people who is untrained at the start of it and he's trying to run full out and then do a light jog and then full out and a light jog and you can see at the start of the program it's really hard to see that there's even any difference there between the full effort and sort of the light jogs but by the end of it three months later you can say oh wow like first of all when he does the jog to start it it doesn't even move basically his his metrics and then you can see that he's got these very clearly defined peaks and goes through that and then is able to rest after that his heart rate recovers very quickly which as you know is a is a sign of being um well trained and adapted to the exercise so i was um really happy going through it um the people there gave about uh 93% of them gave it a four or a five out of a five scale rating um they had improved metrics throughout and their uh v2 max their resting heart rate um their heart rate variability and i got a lot of comments that the the feedback uh from the group of sort of like talking and hearing how it's going for other people hearing about other people's suffering and triumphs um and also the the flexibility of finding places different ways to exercises and supporting each other to say okay well not everything has to be a run uh some of the people didn't like running and so they would def find a different uh way of getting in their high-intensive exercise but always making sure to be consistent about that so that was just the first uh segment of it now we're already in the second uh quarter of it which is the strength challenge so they've already dialed some of that high-intensity interval back to be in a maintenance phase where they can continue to grow up b at a slower pace but that habit now is well established uh now for them that's just kind of a a weekly thing that they do every week and now we're getting in very deep and focusing on the strength training what it is to have a maximumly efficient time efficient strength training that you can do kind of just uh in a few visits a week and yet still get significant gains during that period so i'm uh i'm really excited about it as a i felt like um this is the first time that the advice that i've had is really making an impact um so i'm uh testing with my friends with uh these about 15 people and i'm hoping to have a large number of people who will test uh this in the year of 2025 so i'm currently accepting pre-registrations uh for people who are interested you can go to un aging.com and go to the unaging system and uh sign up there and participate it the the program is all free uh my my personal benchmark is i like to keep track of it is how many years of life has the research that i've done saved right so this is 15 people okay 20 years per person that's about 300 years of life from these initial 15 people um couple quick questions chris goad so so the uh the plot you showed with the uh average heart rate you know and then the person right so that's a beautiful data uh i wonder if so were there uh physical and cognitive benefits or any benefits did the person notice that they felt better because so you'd assume left to right you're obviously you're more cardio vascularly fit on the right versus the left right so uh was was there subjective feelings of improvement where they could feel that difference or this is just something that that they've got going on on the inside they don't even know it subjectively they're the same no the the people definitely noticed it um uh one of the one of the guys who had had not done training before basically he he uh he was doing runs cuz that was the best way to measure the heart rate things and basically every week he would have a new record personal best record for the fastest he'd ever run um and i i noticed it with other fellows as well the the fellow who had had trouble climbing up the stairs by the end of it um we went on a a bit of a travel through the city of tokyo together and he was right on my heels um as we're going up and downstairs uh throughout the stations and it was immediately apparent that these are different people sort of than um as far as their ability to just move through the world had been significantly changed um yeah so the the numbers were kind of a nice way to keep track of it but um the feedback that i got is that very much it was they just felt more comfortable and effortless uh moving through their daily lives cool and then also how did you how did each person or maybe you did prescribe their uh fitness days right so were you using like hrv resting heart rate to guide it or it was just field you know you had you had a set was it you had a set time it was the hour and a half a week that was the goal or it was as many days as you could can get in get in like so what was the prescription how were people prescribed because i'm sure that there was a range of some people maybe did more than 150 minutes per week maybe some people did less so how is that how how did you come to or how did they come to that prescription so uh there was a uh a pro protocol that was shared for everyone as far as amount of minutes of high intensity and low intensity um but the protocol started out a little bit less actually than an hour and a half as they worked into it um one of the things that i'll be adapting is that i really want this to be available to everyone we did have some people who were very much out of shape um who was a real challenge for and uh from the feedback i got from them and they still were able to complete the challenge is that they said okay look when i started there was no high intensity i was just doing the running or whatever it was and that was enough but by the end of three week three months they were able to do that so each person was able to um i mean select for what they could do um and work through but there was no um timing of it uh because of the outset of it honestly an hour and a half a week is not much uh you would be doing two to three hours of yourself right now right depending on sort of your uh biometrics um so because it was low enough i felt comfortable saying uh when you have the time and um one of the things about aerobic exercises as well uh is is that uh aerobic is pretty much straight linear like as long as you're doing the time in the week and you're not doing too much um and you can do up to about i think i figured out before is about two and a half hours of high intensity total time before you start to crater um at that point then you're no longer getting the benefit of the high intensity and your performance starts to degrade but we were far below that for the entire time so um as a result they're able to time it when it worked for them in their schedule um they also eventually figured out that you didn't actually have to put a day between of rest between aerobic exercise you can do that two days in a row and in fact if you want to you can do two exercise two workouts in a row so they're like wait you mean i could just do an hour and a half and just be done in one like on monday of the week and i'm like uh you can it's not fun but i'm not going to tell you it won't work um so uh not i don't think anyone ever took up that uh challenge but i did have guys who like the week got busy or something and so instead on the sunday they would do an hour of uh workout instead of doing two days or a half hour so it was very up much up to them on how they felt but also what they were able to schedule in the work uh within the week because it very much it's supposed to be something that you do um to help you live the rest of your life better as opposed to the new focus of your life yeah that's great so since you have the data i mean technically you could compare for the people who did you know the hour and a half in one session an hour a couple times a week and then the 20 minutter right even though it's you have i think you said 15 people um which approach may be best for uh you know improvements in cardiovascular fitness whether it's you know hrv resting heart rate the average heart rate you know technically you could compare so for the person who says i want to do an hour and a half session per week if you've got a group of people what you do that are doing 20 minutes a day you can say look the 20 now granted you have factors like is is there weight loss is it adjusted for age and sex and all this other stuff right but right you know you could say look the 20 minute group had maybe it's true whatever the data be may be i'm presuming it right but if the 20-minute group had better gains relative to the once per week or twice per week versus five or six days of shorter you could say well why not give this a try too and see how your body adapts maybe your body is more physiologically adapted to shorter more often and then you could even go conversely right so for the people who are doing 20 minutes a week would they benefit like what is the best approach at the end i i get i get i get where you're you know this is great you know uh as a start right but my analytical brain wants try all the yeah you know so and maybe that's something down the road the beginning it's it's it's it's uh behavioral modification and being able to consistently do these things over time forever right because which goes into my uh you know the idea of lives years of liv saved right so do three months of improving fitness translate for you know another 50 plus years you know you know so midlife rap ayon extends lifespan right just for a short period of time so does improving your fitness for three months does that carry or you've gotta you've got to maintain it you've got to do it consistently over the next you know 50 years to gain those benefits so no it's a great start don't get me wrong but you know i wouldn't jump the gun on saying you know how many lives yeah you know it's uh oh you're you're absolutely right so i don't um if they start and stop there's no i don't i don't think you get any credit for that i mean uh high school athletes don't live that much appreciably longer i think than uh people who never were athletes so the the design behind it as a result of that is that for instance the the high-intensity interval training then continues throughout the entire year the first year the first uh three months is spent establishing the habit learning how to do it getting com able with it and then it's maintained throughout that entire year so then it's a lifelong habit because as you point out if they it's not you don't get that much life- saving if you stop it but if you continue that for a half hour or so a week for the rest of your life consistency is is the winner in the the marathon of life so i don't know about the uh for the the trial that we did i don't have enough data yet to make a distinction between the one hour a day versus the 20 minutes a day uh hopefully maybe when we have a 100 people or a thousand people partic participating uh then i'll be able to do more analysis on those kind of things yeah believe it or not even though i'm technically in the hour and a half twice a week the 20 minutes or 30 minutes per day that's probably g going to be the better group where they end up with fast either it's faster gains with less overtraining or you know just uh you know higher heart rate variability lower resting heart rate that would be my bet even though technically i'm not in that category yet so we'll see how it plays out all right so uh strength so what's the what's the um are you focusing on compound movements is it the same 20 minutes session so what's the strategy in terms of uh designing the approach there so once again we're looking at the the maximizing the immediate health and and all time and long-term longevity so for the strength then we're we're dealing um basically take uh from they've been doing three high-intensity workout so we take uh two of those out and replace them with a strength training and it's a half hour each time so this is the optimal amount when you look at the longevity studies for what get you the most longevity out of strength training it's very clear that the correct answer is an hour total time per week so okay so now we have half an hour of high-intensity interval training and then we add into that an hour of strength training in two sessions and so very much so as you as you appropriately guessed uh for the strength training it's mostly focused on the compound movements if you're only doing a half an hour hour and you want to do a full body workout then very much you want to be getting into the big exercises so we've been focusing on that quite a bit and i've actually been meeting with every single person uh in a onetoone weightlifting session just to say okay let's talk about this this is how you do this this is how you do um the big exercises um the bench um lat pull downs or rows for back so a push a pull and also a leg exercise and the leg exercise as much as possible focusing on just straight deadlifts and squats cuz those are great exercises as you know that are going to give you a lot of stimulation for the strength training for them and they're for they're exercises that require precise form in order to do them safely and well so i've i've got uh some documents that i've been sharing with everyone i've been going okay this is ripto's youtube guide on how to do a squat this is ripto's youtube guide is one of the theuh experts on uh weightlifting of how to do deadlifts and then i go and meet with them and then we've also been talking through that to make sure that they have their form running and it's really just three exercises a push a pull and a leg exercise and they get to pick sort of what they do with what they have around them one fellow for a while was working uh with kettle bells basically as his primary exercise another one has a holding gym and he's using dumbbells for all of them uh many of them uh then go to the gym and have been going to the gym and learning how to use the the um squat bar squat rack and then also be doing the deadlifts and things so uh people been able to do it but the fun the foundation is what i found that really helps people to say okay look these are the three exercises we're doing it twice a week it's half an hour and we do that for the next three months and then the goal is as many sets and reps within that 30 minute period or is it you know x amount of each so five sets of bench five you know five five five it's it's just as much as you can do in that 30 minute span oh we've got it all um i made a spreadsheet to track it for everyone and then we've got a progress board so you can see basically how everyone is doing and um i wasn't sure about the progress board right like that's kind of part of the social aspect of it but uh many people found it very motivating actually to see okay everybody else is doing this right like i should be updating my uh progress board and uh i use uh one of the common weightlifting formulas then to calculate what the one rep max is so if you uh say bench press 50 kilograms um or i can't do that off i pounds okay 50 kgrs uh for 10 reps then uh there's formulas on the internet that will cal cal for you then what your probable one rep max is what the maximum you could lift at one time is and so then that gives you comparison so if one day you do say uh 50 kilograms for 12 reps and then the next day you do 55 kgs for 10 reps you can know whether you are effectively doing more weightlifting whether you worked harder and so then the spreadsheet then gives tracking for that for every exercise and shows how you did and then also shows how everyone else did so that you can see and kind of feel how you're doing and everyone's been able to put that in and sort of entered it with her own thing but it gives a structure to just say okay look we're doing three sets of these three exercises and you basically find something so that you should be struggling to finish on the last uh reps of the last set and after that then you sort of select what works for you with the environment that you have so generally there's about a uh three rep loss for each 10 pound increase so if you're doing 10 reps at 50 kilograms well let's say 50 pounds because it's easier for me my dumb american brain to think in pounds i' have to so it's 50 kilogram is 110 pounds 2.2 anyway so that so uh 50 pounds if you're doing 10 reps at 100 pounds right so uh it's generally your 1 rm would probably be around 130 so you just 110 you could probably do 110 for seven 120 for four and then 1 130 for three but that's just the general you know ballark uh estimate so it's it's i think you said three sets of each exercise so nine sets sets in that 30 minute uh span yeah so you know even even though it's only 30 minutes technically you know it's you can do it where it's super seted and there may be people who are doing more than or can do more than nine set so for example my workouts is are essentially circuit training based so i'm not training for my 1 rm i'm trying to keep it in that 10 to well i do lower rep ranges sometimes but still it's circuit training based where it's it's constant movement the whole time it's not one set wait three minutes do another set you know so you could and probably get a pretty strong cardiovascular stimulus granted not as much as doing an allout sprint for 20 30 40 seconds whatever it is but uh so is it geared are you trying to do like a circuit training based workout or it's only nine sets as long as you get those nine sets just chill you're good so at at this point and um i mean there's a there's a flow of information as we're going through it so that's one of the other things that i've worked to help support people and kind of keep them aware of the challenge and keep it interesting right so um we don't say this is the this is what you're doing and then have them do it for uh 12 weeks and then say good job and here there's the next challenge so as we're going through it so uh for instance um i hope well i mean if they're watching it it's fine i haven't actually talked about super setting yet because it's a great idea as you point out and it's a good way to compress the total amount of time um i was uh planning to um tell them about that in uh after the first two months are done so at the beginning of the third month i would say by the way you can further compress the amount of time that you take to do this by doing super setting which is then going to give you more benefit reach for each of them and you don't need to put spend as much time waiting between but um for this point at least especially i mean in the first month was honestly most people were kind of figuring out getting a gym membership like where do i do this what are these exercises like how do i enter into the spreadsheet the second month now i feel like they're starting to really hit the hit the road um many of them are taking creatine which is one of the things i offered is like a extra credit this is going to help you to lift it's pretty harmless and we'll definitely give you more rep reps um but that sort of uh gives them something to work with so that it it continues interest them but um the offer though of like doing more things they totally could but the drive is to do is to say this is what you pardon me this is what you need to do and once you do this you're done you get out of the gym this is not um of course you could do more but honestly it's going to start to get more less healthy if you're doing more than a total time of an hour and um like that's an hour i think of normal people exercise and as we talked about uh compound exercises are much more stressful le a normal exercise so i've actually and many of them do do much more exercise some of them have said you want me to exercise three times a week for 30 or two times a week for 30 minutes i already do it every day and i've been like hey great but my my advice is to say you don't need to do that much um this is a long-term thing you're already going to to gain even just doing it twice a week and so the program is just to do the three sets and super set them if you will to save more time and then to get on with your day all right so then the third aspect which i know is generally underrated in your approach is you know the flexibility training and so paper was recently published and i'm probably going to make a video on this at some point but they actually looked at um there's a a standard way to assess flexibility of i think you know all the major joints ankle knee hip shoulder uh trunk um and so they looked at that in association with your favorite measure all cause mortality risk and as expected lower a lower range of motion so they're they're going on full range of motion like that in a scoring system based on that so even like wrist range of motion was a part of the equation um so so they sum the range of motion scores across all of the major joints and i think they it was something like 20 joints which is crazy and then look that all cause mortality risk and as expected you know the the worse your flexibility score for the total the higher risk for all cause mortality so um any any plans to include some kind of flexibility training you know into the approach right so um the uh the the irony of it is is they've had uh head-to-head uh randomized control test where they had one group of people who's doing classic stretching we're going to be doing leg stretching and kind of bend over and reaching toes and that kind of thing and another group doing strength training so they're doing deadlifts and squats and they found actually the people doing the strength training gained more flexibility than the people who were doing the stretching so um when i hear that i'm like okay i'm good and actually when you mentioned that study i'm like that sounds fascinating if they're going into all cause mortality that is my metric of choice um but i don't know then if it's uh if they are the people who were flexible did they get that from doing stretching or did they get that from doing strength training uh which could be just as good and also giving you the benefit uh my my my desire is to find things as optimally as they can so if you can get the stretching from doing the strength training i think that's just the win i haven't seen otherwise so i'm interested in the study of course um to see how it kind of lines up with other things i have uh one friend uh who thinks that uh to be truly athletic you must be able to do the splits johan claude vam style and so he's he works on that and puts effort into that and i'm like i don't think there's all course mortality tied to john claude you know like being able to do the splits between two trucks driving backwards um but uh but if it's something that's key to you then that's something that i'm also want to to bring into the program as we come into the later stages of it i'm uh looking forward to working with people in finding okay what do you like we're going to give people the background so that they've got the exercise and know how to do the routine and then i'll want to say okay what is it what would it be for you to be truly fit and to feel like you're meeting your maximum potential and towards the end of it i hope to help people focus on that so um maybe i will be adding the stretching program at the end i don't know so i i don't disagree with the the data on static stretching versus the active movements and even if you take like a static stretch like for a squat without being weighted right so if you're just going to try to stretch in a squat position now you add a little bit of weight to a squat you know with whether it's a bar holding kettle bells or holding some weights so you're going to get an increased stimulus you're building strength throughout that full range of motion which should further improve your range of motion in that given movement so i see how it makes sense where the uh the weightlifting can be a better approach than the static movements but for example if i think most people are focused only on the compound movements so there are going to be ranges of motion where they may be limited in for example uh you know trunk trunk mobility stiffens during aging so your ability to basically form an l right so you're standing up like a good morning and then you're able to just basically legs are straight you're able to go there so lower back gets weaker and your flexibility and that so unless people are training that it's probably going to get more stiff and uh that stiffness in that region increases uh stress on the discs so then even simple lifting movements may become you know more risky because now you're stiffer in in that range of motion uh and in their region so anyway i i think it's a huge part of the i've trained clients in the past when i was a fitness trainer 20 years ago people in their 70s and 80s who never trained you know outside even of squats just like i said just trunk mobility and just being able for them to go from a standing up position to even like 15 degrees of flex trunk flexion was was a challenge so and that's going to affect quality of life like if you can barely move how would a squat a squat wouldn't take care of that range of motion you know nor would a bench press or a rose so um i find huge value granted this doesn't mean you've got to be a yoga instructor or john cla john claude vanam doing the splits even though that is the ideal you know so um and when you think about too just taking it to a separate place like athletes elite athletes who have strength through a full range of motion not just static stretching but strength in each movement so if you're a basketball player and you actually train ankle mobility expecting that you're going to roll your ankle at some point but strengthening through those potential ranges of motion your injury risk is going to be limited and a big part of consistency is minimizing injury so if your joints are all flexible through a uh strong and flexible through a full range of motion you'd probably minimize injury risk which should be good for uh you know consistency in training and quote you know dot dot dot potentially longev so yeah um like the specific training for things is a is a great idea in general i i like to try and um and and i don't know i'm i'm interested to hear like what you talked about about working with people who are 70 or 80 years old um i do have some people who i've worked with on that but they're exceptionally athletic ones so i'm not seeing that kind of thing that you're talking about where they can't even do a little bit of a bow um but we'll see um i have some of the people that i'm working with are are older than i and are having more kind of a challenge of the posture for say the deadlift and so i'm uh hopeful that the the deadlift and sort of like learning how to get the posture right where your shoulders are down and back and that you're basically pulling up through uh will help them with some of their posture challenges as they're getting older um the the strength training is doesn't actually add as much longevity as the um high intensity or some of the other things that we'll be doing but uh as far as quality of life stuff that you talk about right like um being able to have good posture and stay uh looking vital and be able to put your suitcase on the overhead rack uh these kind of things are or carry grandkids or whatever it is um as peter ata talks about are very important and the strength to deal with them i think is going to be a big deal um yeah it's something it's something worth watching not just that picking stuff up off the floor is basically it's a granted it's a flexibility movement but there is some strength there because if you don't actively train that movement which is trunk flexion and okay let's assume that you bend your knees you know when you do that maybe i don't because i'm still trying to i'm doing a hamstring stretch if i'm picking something up off the floor it's like an extra that's supposed to be good right like i like when i'm doing my laundry sometimes like i try and do the the back bend right so that i get the uh the full hamstring stretch out of it yeah but if for most people they're not training that and and aren't practicing it or have limited or poor flexibility hamstring lower back so there's going to i know maybe i'm repeating but there could be a point at later in life where the back is so weak and untrained and lacks flexibility where oh now you've got a herur disc because even just a small amount amount of movement isn't is a strain on the discs whereas you know if you properly trained it uh for decades maybe not so much anyway but i include it i include it essential so for me i uh i mean confessions i i never stretch ever um and uh and i was paying the price for that 10 years ago uh before i started doing the weightlifting i couldn't touch my toes um and uh since then i've gotten back into the squats and the deadlifts and now i have no problem picking things off the floor touching my toes so and that's without ever with with never doing any stretching whatsoever so i think it i think that it's a different road but i think it can get some of that flexibility back where you most need it in the functional ability yeah definitely definitely definitely all right so next up fasting okay you've got some nightmare on nightmare story or stories on fasting here yeah well it's only i mean it's only for me maybe because i have a long history of it um so let's see here hold on i'm going to come and uh start bringing up some of the research that i did this has actually all come up because of a blog post yep um so i was uh looking at some of the the blog posts and uh seeing that some of the uh longevity and health experts um peter aa ronda patrick had uh looking were looking negatively at fasting and they thought it was a good thing before and it was going to help them to live for such a long time and they decided well maybe not so then they started to talk about look uh if you do fasting you start to lose muscle um and it can be very difficult so this is a study specifically from peter aa's website it's hosted there um and it talked about doing fasting and this is intermittent fasting which is to say that you within a week that you pick several days where you fast don't eat anything for the entire day and specifically these people ate zero calories on the fasting day so was a strict fast so the result that he talks about when he says you lose muscle are basically these results here where you can see we have three groups here where one group has got um is doing calorie restrictions this is just basically dieting and they're doing 75% every day so they're at 25% less than they would normally eat if they could eat what they wanted and then we have an alternate day fasting so these are people who are fasting every other day and then eating and they're fast they're eating zero on the fasting days and 150% of calories so 50% more than normal on the days they eat and then we have a third group where these people are doing ultra day fasting but they're eating 200% of calories on the days that they're eating so for them you can see here that we have this is the the lean mass loss and the fat loss so the people who are doing calorie restriction and these are healthy people by the way these are already people who have a bmi under 25 they're lean people they're basically losing all fat so they're doing a great job they're happy they're losing just a little bit of lean muscle um but then the uh the group that's doing the all day fasting is losing half of that is lean mass and half of it's fat and then for the people who are getting all the calories they need then they're not losing the fat they're just losing muscle and so you can understand why uh someone would look at this and say okay this is a terrible deal but um i had been fasting actually doing five2 fasting which is where you fast two days every week um for about 10 years and this was about the first five years was what i was doing was a protocol kind of like these where i would go to zero strict calorie nothing and i found just what they talked about i found that i was losing a lot of muscle yes i could rebuild it back but i wasn't really maintaining as much as i wanted to and that uh continued for a while until i went and uh read a nutrition book um there it is right there my nutrition book behind me and uh realize that uh one of the limitations of getting zero calories is that there are almost all the cells in your bodies have mitochondria and can use fat for energy but the key word there is almost all the cells in your body the red blood cells in your body um do not have mitochondria and they can only survive with sugar for energy so when you're in ketosis and you have ketones circling through your body they can't use any of that they have to rely on your liver to basically catabolize to eat your muscles and make them into sugar so that the red blood cells don't die so this is why with this kind of a protocol where you're going to zero for your fasting days you're going to be losing a lot of lean mass in your muscles so another study then that is more like the protocol that i use where instead they're going with a uh 25% of calories maybe 300 or 400 or so so here's another study and this one was done with young overweight women but it's another study pretty similar it's about uh 6 months long and they were also going on fasting and compared against people who are doing calor restriction of just 25% less than what they would normally eat and you can see here the results are quite different so they're doing again 25% reduction so 75% of their calorie intake and then they're doing intermittent fasting so 52 fasting so two days they would have 27% so 300 or 400 500 calories a day and the other days they would eat just slightly less than usual so that the both uh programs are getting the same calorie intake but you can see as far as the lean mass versus the fat mass here that it's much better if you get just a little bit of calories on your fasting days that you're doing a much better job of cutting the fat and saving the muscle that you want to keep so i've been doing this for about 5 years and was feeling like i was winning the game game and i'm keeping my uh weight where i want it to be by doing the fasting but when i'm writing the article about uh fasting i also wanted to cover uh tim restricted fasting so tim restricted fasting instead of fasting a whole day you say within a day i want to compress the time that i'm eating so i'm only eating let's say um from 8:00 a.m. Until uh 2: in the afternoon or something or like an 8 hour kind of fast sort of thing or maybe until 400 p.m. Or something so when i started to look at that i found a stud that said basically breakfast is really important so here's another study where they looked at the randomized control for time-restricted eating and they had here uh some people who were doing early tim restricted feeding so they were eating in the breakfast lunch and an early dinner at like 4 p.m. And midday time restricted feeding where they were eating at noon starting with lunch and then having a dinner at say uh 4: and then a supper at 8:00 or something and the results were quite uh stark despite both of them eating in the same time restricted window uh we find that basically uh if you look at the body weight or the percentage of body fat or the body fat mass only the early people had a significant difference from the control so despite both of them eating and about the same kind of a time window the only people who had the benefit for their effort was in losing fat and losing weight was the people who were eating breakfast and eating an early dinner or skipping dinner so as i read this i'm like okay this is interesting so if if you're doing time restricted fasting to lose weight you need to be doing it in the morning and skipping dinner but then i said okay well let me look how much um like i know that you should eat breakfast if you don't eat breakfast you'll probably die faster with an increased premature death but if you don't eat dinner how much life do you gain like i assume it's better to always skip dinner um so then i found this study which told me i was wrong about all of that um this is the meal skipping and shorter meal intervals and this study went um with the n haynes uh study of diet which is about 150,000 person years of data and it's quite thorough um it's a american data set and going through exactly what it is that uh people ate whether they ate breakfast whether they ate lunch whether they ate dinner how much time was between them and then it tracks over 15 to 20 years or so whether they died early or not and this one uh surprised me quite a bit cuz i said okay well look here we go uh yes if you don't eat breakfast you'll have about a 10% increase in all cause mortality or premature death um but that's just the start of it if you skip lunch you're going to have about 12% increase in premature death and if you skip dinner you're going to have about a 16% increase in a premature death um so this surprised me greatly because this is the opposite of what i had expected i had thought that this would be okay skipping breakfast is bad lunch is so so and skipping dinner is a good thing right sort of the old idea of eating a very very small lunch or skipping or skipping a dinner entirely is a healthy thing but in fact all of them have about a 10% increase in all cause mortality in the hazard ratio and the study then goes on to say in fact you just should eat more meals a day like uh using three meals a day as the standard if you only eat two meals a day we have about a 7% increase so just skipping one meal will cost you about a 7% increase in premature death shortened life and if you eat only one meal a day or omad you now have a 30% increase in all cause mortality so and and even on the other side of it if you're eating four meals a day so you eat an extra meal on top of that now you actually have better than the people who have three meals a day and now you have it's a trend it's not significant but now you have about a 9% reduction in all cause mortality so when i looked at this um it's it was hard for me to justify going from this that if you're eating uh three meals is good two meals is not as good and one meal is bad that eating zero meals a day was going to be better so um this i basically now have changed my entire approach to fasting and now i realize that the the healthiest diet if you will is to get constant food in small doses throughout the day another uh stat from the same study is that if you eat your meals too closely together uh less than 4 and a half hours apart then you have a 17% increase in all cause mortality so again this is very bad so i realized that basically by skipping two meals every week i was increasing the amount of food that i would eat at the other meals by about 40% which then um if you remember from the the all cause or the the fasting before i'll skip back to it that if you look at this you can see that even though this person was eating 200% of the calories they were still losing weight um so your body is just not as metabolically efficient when you have too much food coming into it at the same time so i've now uh as of next week i'm going to be stopping my 10year habit of five2 fasting and uh learning how to eat three square meals a day i don't think i'm going to go to four but at least three squares of meals a day and uh eat with more reserve because one of the parts of fasting two days a week is you feel like you can eat uh as much as you want the other days because you've already had a significant reduction in your overall calorie count but um uh it was uh quite a shock for me but um i live i i live by the all cause mortality die by the all cause mortality so um i mean it's it's about a 10% difference to put it in perspective this is about the amount of benefits you get from eating three vegetables a day or eating two pieces of fruit a day it's not as much benefit as you would get from strength training or doing high-intensity interval but at the same time uh fasting would put me out of out of um sync with the rest of the world and so i always felt like i was kind of doing something a little different they're going off to lunch i'm like uh i'm going to have a coffee with milk see you later so it's i'm looking forward to actually having more of a normal lifestyle to say that i'm eting in sort of the meals that are common with everyone and hopefully we'll get some better health and longevity and blood work out of it as well all wait so there may be some good news may maybe you don't have to change the whole story yet so yeah okay uh let let's start all the way at the bat let's start off i took notes so first was uh how did they assess uh lean mass is this dexa or ctmri it's a good question um it's uh and to be uh precise they had fat and then they had fat free mass right so yeah if they were losing bone mass or other things that would also be counted as this but um i don't think they had dex it was probably done um with an electro impedance instead yeah so not as good but not that it is what it is so that that's one number two is whole body lean mass i if this also included bone that's not necessarily ideal um if you're going to look at lean m and also um so whole body lean mass doesn't just include muscle right you've got organ weights there you've got connective tissue so we don't know that the quote unquote loss and lean mass is specific to muscle now if if they one way that uh studies can get around this is by looking at appendicular lean mass so lean mass of the arms and legs because no organs you do have some connective tissue and that highly strongly correlates with actual muscle mass measurements so i i i haven't looked into this study but um it's possible to have changes in lean mass and not have changes in muscle mass so that that's that's one thing and now note that granted i'm in that continuous cr group you know i'm just playing devil's advocate here you know where okay yeah i don't have any skin in the game i'm just trying to trying to be objective and and you know not jump to um you know the peter and ronda conclusions of fasting is quote unquote bad so another factor to consider too in these studies is and i didn't look at them but um you know if you're fasting so i think i think the assumption when people are fasting is it's going to lead you to lose weight because you eat less right so you're fasting you're eating less but it what about the overcompensation on the days when you actually have food right so right and there are animal studies where if you know you it's not cr but if you take food away for one day and then you leave the food there the next day they actually double on the next day and end up pretty close to uk caloric so the assumption with the fasting um studies and i think fasting in the pop culture all over the interwebs is hey if you're fasting you're going to lose weight because you're going to eat less that's not that doesn't necessarily have to be the case right anecdotally anecdotally i can say that i've had days in the distant past where i'd eat six seven 8,000 calories in a day uh and eat it pretty early in the day and then fast for the rest of the day technically i'm fasting right or or or or uh eat you know six seven 8,000 calories that day fast for the rest of the day try to fast for the next day so technically i'm in that fasting window too but i'm in a caloric excess so i don't know how carefully these studies are controlled for calorie intake um which is a huge part of that equation which is which goes back to this is why i a favor for me and it may be different for others if it works for others and your biomarkers are good i'd say go for it i wouldn't these are small randomized control uh studies in other people which can be a good guide which could be repres representative of the population based average but of being on a given fasting approach like in your case 52 helps you maintain a lean body weigh uh and and and which is a big part of this story if that helps you stick to a calorie goal over a long period of time and stay lean which is a big part of fitness and health and longevity i'd say keep it there and if you change your approach or anybody changes their approach and that messes up the system where now it's harder to maintain that caloric you know whether it's close to maintenance or below and stay lean i'd say don't do it even even if the studies show otherwise in rcts of other people you know it's all about does that translate to you so in my case the tim restricted feeding i'm not doing it for any purported metabolic benefits or you know in my case because the diet is so rich in fruits and vegetables if i eat later than you know oneish uh or the majority of it by oneish i'm waking up more in the middle of the night it's bad my sleep quality if it's bad for my sleep quality i feel terrible in the morning so for me a shorter eating window is more beneficial i don't see a difference in biomarkers i've had the omad where it was 6 to 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. At night not not eating the whole day wow it was terrible for my sleep but it i i changed it not because of what the publish study showed but because it improved my sleep quality and and performance so um i think i think sounding the alarm is is too early on that you know uh i think individuality and looking at biomarkers you know is is key yeah um absolutely agree so um thank you i brought that up in my blog post but i didn't bring it up in my talking here um because especially initially right when you go to uh tim restriced feeding or uh intermittent fasting either one of them is going to alter your sort of habits and it's going to help you to lose weight um and can be a useful thing that's one of the things i was using it for for many years so absolutely agree that is one of the benefits of it and uh that could be more than enough to make it worth it to someone if that kind of having that routine of it to say okay look i'm going to eat by this time and then after that i'm done eating for the day and i've eaten the portion that i that i decide that is that i should be eating um then that's absolutely worth doing and then is can give you enough benefit to more than allet the fact that you might be eating a little more and you're calorie restricted anyway so for you i see uh i see good things all over so yes um i agree very much that it uh depends on sort of how you do it for myself um i'm fairly disciplined and i'm i'm pretty sure that i'll be able to eat although other people who know me are less confident i'm going to be able to eat free meals a day and and and not gain weight but um i'm always up for a challenge so i'm going to do my best and uh try and do that and honestly if it doesn't work you're right i'll be going back to fasting because it's more important that i maintain sort of the the body weight that i want to have uh than worry about sort of maybe a 10% loss here i've got i've got some buffer yeah so assuming that the 10 10% would translate to you right i mean we'd have to see right uh some changes you know whether it's is it metabolic health that improves is it kidney function liver function inflammation if none of that improves with the change in you know 52 to eating more meals per day is there really any benefit right i i i' like to see objective biomarkers rather than this blanket of if you eat 52 or omad or x diet you know uh this is the all cause mortality but i i prefer you know i prefer greater specificity what's specifically improving and if nothing changes biochemically have you really improved anything right so well that that's that's exactly um that's exactly right and in the studies one of the things that's interesting is that they as they work through them they say okay we've had this person doing fast and we've had this person doing calorie restriction and it's known that there are benefits to doing calor restriction losing weight uh even losing a few pounds or so even if you're very overweight losing a few pounds is a huge change in the metabolic systems and they basically found that both fasting and calorie restriction the benefits that they have is basically the calories you cut out so that ba and so the the tricky part about that is is that um if you're no longer still losing calories and i had been doing fasting for 10 years and so i had my own habits of eating more on the other days to compensate once i had reached the weight that i want to be at um so especially if you are using it to lose weight or even just to keep weight off and that can be something that's very important and it seems to me that is almost entirely benefit they talked about autophagy for a while right the cleaning out of the cellular mechanisms within the cell and some other things but at this point there's been nothing that's really come up as convincing uh as a unique and independent benefit out of it aside from the weight loss or control yeah i agree weight loss is the biggest thing but i think the individuality is the is the big key here that you mentioned right and i think people trying the different approaches and seeing you know whether it's omad even if omad what you showed omad may be bad for all cause mortality risk but if omad leads you to eating less calories than you would usually would i think that's a benefit regardless of what the studies and other people show right so y but i think the the key is finding which of the approaches works for you to be able to stay as lean as possible to carry as little visceral fat as possible abdominal uh you know obesity uh and for it maybe it's not omad or maybe it's not 52 maybe it is a cr maybe you know mild cr but i think trying all the different things is a big part of figuring out what works at the individual uh level so another thing to note is is you know aside from the it's hard to control these studies in people and granted they're short-term studies right so five weeks or so uh and granted looking at animal models isn't ideal because it's not people but at least in in mice you're all the variables are controlled uh how much they're moving right they're in a cage they don't have generally don't have an exercise wheel you can control their calories you can control when they eat and how much they eat so the one of the longest you know calories if you calorie restrict mice but then shorten their eating window and allow them to eat during their normal circadian rhythm which is during the night not during the day mice are nocturnal their circadian rhythm natural is nocturnal whereas ours is awake during the uh you know during the night uh during the daytime and asleep during the nighttime that's the longest lifespan extension relative to fasting alone so um that's a big but all of the variables are controlled they're not overeating they're getting a set amount of calories and they don't have a choice but to eat those set amount of calories so so i think so that's what the animal model to me that suggests what could be possible in people so that's actually the approach that i favor but the other part too is satiety right so uh and actually there's two other variables here satiety right so which of these dietary approaches in terms of how often to eat how much to eat one meal a day or two whatever it is are you satiated right for me i can end the eating window relatively ear early and be satiated without wanting to eat almost never the rest of the day but if if i had to force myself where it's like all right i ended the eating window at one and now five o'clock has come around and i don't have any more calories that may trigger a binge and that's detrimental to the whole approach i generally don't have that because the diet is satiating so making sure your diet is satiating on any approach to be able to maint maintain those calorie goals uh is a big part of it now the other thing too about fasting and lean mass or fasting and muscle mass in my case and i can't say if this is true for others one reason i don't prefer the very long fast aside from the you know the ending the eating window early you know oneish and then going for the next day that's basically a daily fast of you know 15 16 hours in the past when i've got gotten beyond that when it comes to doing a workout i have mala i don't want to do the workout it's hard to be motivated and that's going to affect workout performance and for me my vitality comes from the workouts if my workout performance is suffering i'm technically on the road to declining function over time and that's you know the antithesis of what i want so that's just for me maybe for some people doing a long fast or fasted cardio i can't even do that i don't want to do that either it it affects my my motivation negatively so hate to say it it comes down to figuring out what works for you but you know but that is you know figuring out what works for you with the fasting approach with it with the calorie intake approach with satiety um that all factors in for it you know for me yeah that's it's a good point like for me i eventually like you get used to it right i think there's a certain period where you kind of uh set into a new habit and uh like hunger is one of those things like if you if you eat a cookie every day at three and then one day you don't boy you really want a cookie at 3:00 so i didn't find that i for me i find i'm able to work out on my fasting days as well as other days um and was able to go through that although uh my strength is usually down i'm especially noticing that now but now that i'm not doing fasting maybe maybe we'll have a bit of a change for it um yeah it's uh it's it's interesting kind of we all have our own ways of uh adapting to these things and i think there's a give giving a try of a few things and then seeing what it is that works best for you personally is very valuable yeah definitely all right next up skin what do you got on skin well i mean i i'm going to start this one out with another confession uh this summer i went to the beach and i scorched myself terribly don't i don't even i mean i was i i read a blog post on it everything here's how you should do sunscreen this is how it worked you know it's so important that you put this on right and i went out to the beach um then i'm just there with my friends uh a typhoon has just come through so we have some beautiful 1 meter high waves great body surfing and uh i do like i do every year where i put on okay one coat of sunscreen before i get out of the out of the hotel and then another screen on the another coat when i get to the beach and then another coat at noon but for this i had a different brand of sunscreen than i usually have uh this was recommended by consumer reports and ship from overseas i don't know if there was if it was older than i thought it didn't actually have an ext iration date on it but um usually when i come back from the beach uh people ask me like wait didn't you go to the sun or something you're still so white but this time i was i was red as a lobster um and quite painful so uh that's my confession to start with um so i think i kind of wanted to train from here and then i wanted to hear you listen to you and and hear some advice for what it is that you do for your skin what would you say is the best way toh take care of yourself well so this is where uh i've got criticized in the past but uh you know people are like you know so i do have some skin sag over here on my eyelids so um i was heavier at one point i was as heavy as like 175 pounds 35 pounds yeah i was big big jimro you know okay yeah um so carrying less weight now my body has adapted where whatever fat i was carrying there now i've got a skin sag right so um and that that's in other regions of my body too so i'd say you know get lean stay lean so you don't stretch your skin out so that at some point now you're carrying around this excess saggy skin right and i'm not i'm not the type to be like hey i'll go for cosmetic surgery and just get trim it down because that's how you end up looking like you know the the the scary mask guy from from saw right so right where you got everything's messed up so um that's one the other thing too is you know this idea of doing it from the inside out like there are things like carotenoids and um you know uh some of the high fruit and vegetable intake uh nut you know nutriceuticals and polyphenols that can impact skin from the inside out but even that too i'm not so sure on how much that can really make a dent right so what i did what i did put together was some of the basic biochemistry of skin aging the thing maybe some people don't know and especially when it comes to sunscreen or moisturizers or even soaps you know um these are things that can negatively affect our skin uh ph which can affect skin aging uh which can affect the skin microbiome putting us at risk for you know having a dbio skin microbiome which can't be good long term so so yeah so skin ph increases during aging so this is a skin surface ph uh in women and and in men two different locations skin ph varies based on location which is kind of tricky because uh ph of the armpit ph of the groin ph of the palms the hands forehead they may all all be different technically we would need different soaps or moisturizers to impact the ph of these regions uh you know but who does that right so anyway you can see the trend is the same so skin ph plotted against age birth through 100 years women and men two different regions you can see the slopes are pretty much increasing so it goes from more acidic and this is log scale so even though a ph of 5.5 versus a ph of 6.5 is one unit and doesn't seem like much it's a log scale which means that's a ph of 6.5 is 10 times less acidic versus a ph of 5.5 so you can see that skin ph in both women and men becomes less acidic during aging and that's be important because you know uh even though i didn't include stuff about the microbiome uh too much here but skin ph is a major determinant of which microbes are on your skin or not so the changing ph can make it easier for some potential pathi to settle on your skin and to be able to colonize your skin increasing risk of infection and all kinds of bad stuff for skin health so when considering that skin ph increases during aging and that's going in the wrong direction youth being characterized by a more acidic skin ph most soaps have a ph greater than nine now it we'll see why a high ph makes a difference or does it make a difference on skin ph in a minute but in this study and i can well of course will provide all of the study uh references in the in the show notes and video's description but they looked at 64 different soaps and you can see 59 of them had a ph of nine so if you're rubbing something on your skin that has a ph of nine and your youthful skin ph should be somewhere around fiveish that isn't going to be good for your skin ph which can again make it easier for the skin microbiome to become dis dis biotic now this study doesn't uh indicate which soaps are on that list so i included a list from a different study that looked at common soaps um and you hear too you can see the majority of them i mean 10 you know 10 12 on this list there were only two that were even in the ballpark of having a a you know a ph of five or less which would be and i'm not promoting either of these this is just what the data shows but it was uh where is it dove dove liquid so hand soap 5.16 not bad and then uh i don't know how to say it abside i guess 3.61 so those would be the best of the bunch uh with the goal of having it somewhere in the five region uh for a soap so what's what does using soap do to skin ph right so that's what we'll see in this study and they didn't indicate which soap they used which is terrible in any study you know this is a randomized control trial granted is small for 14 people and they also use a shower gel which they ind indicated the ph was six but they didn't indicate which one that they used but nonetheless skin ph and then you've got three time points before washing immediately after washing and then two four and six um hours after washing with either the shower gel water or soap right so you can see that after using that soap immediately after you can see that it's significantly different from the groups that use the shower gel ph6 and tap water which should have a ph of around seven so this was probably a soap that had a ph of greater than seven in in order for skin ph to go you know from uh or or to be from 5.8 to jump to 6.4 and then at every time point afterwards you can see that using soap pushed skin ph and remember skin ph increases during aging so it's going in the wrong direction using these soaps so i wouldn't say i'm anti- soap it's just you want to use a skin cleanser that has a ph around five uh and i can tell everybody what what i use which is kind of problematic because every time i go to buy it now it's out of stock and they're increasing the price so i guess supply and demand but the one that i use i looked up the uh msds on it and um the ph is five so now is that going to be best for my uh skin health i don't know but i don't want to do i don't want to chronically you know push my skin ph higher and then you know with exogenous agents right and you know paul saladino is uh not the name drop but you know he's he's he's always talking about uh you know these chemicals you know you want to stay away from chemicals and toothpaste and soap and on this one he may be right you know where uh you got to pay attention to what you're rubbing on your skin um because it may be doing and my daughter my 15-year-old she's constantly putting these creams and sunscreens and you know you've got to know what you're you're putting on your skin you know with specificity you know granted the and i'm not anti-s sunscreen but there may be things there to block uv ra which are going to limit your ability to get burned but if it's got other chemicals in there which are going to be bad for skin ph and the skin microbiome is it more harm than good rather than just being in the sun for 10 or 20 minutes without sunscreen and then getting out of the sun right so um h but for the i mean the sun the sun stuff at least so i've got i mean i can put it right here i've got my sv right this is a very common thing i think uh brian johnson also used the same thing which gives me confidence because i'm sure he could buy something more expensive he wanted to um but i've been using like ever since i did the research on uva on its uh presence throughout the day uvb is what gives you the the bright red sunburn a lot of it and a lot of the suntan lotions in the states are targeted the the uvb because it's sort of the one that is the uh has more of a peak in the summer in the middle of the day but the uva is sort of with you all the time and it goes through windows and other things so in my habit now i wake up in the morning and immediately um put on put in my cont so i can see and also put on the suntan lotion but uh i'm i'm really interested what you're talking about the soap up until now i've been thinking that the liquid soaps would be worse cuz sort of more artificial or something but it's a fascinating to think that okay well actually if you got like a more gentle one that is more in line with the body ph it might over time be better for you yeah it's not just the soaps too it's uh moisturizers so you'd expect that the moisturizers should acidify the skin and even i have this in my book you know uh i guess we'll put that in the show notes too b my book from 2016 which had a section on optimizing skin ph with the goal of minimizing you know uh skin infections which can then translocate into the blood but moisturizers which you'd expect to be good for skin ph many of them are also in the same ballpark as phs soap where it's eight nine 10 yeah so um what what you put on your skin is huge you know granted how much going back to the sun exposure how much uva or uv b we get is debatable right because we evolve to be in the sun right so we need it for vitamin d synthesis so if you're going to i'm in the boat where getting some sun exposure without any creams or anything on my face or body is essential right now what that u shaped curve looks like with too little being bad and too much being bad i'm not sure but i i tred my best to get as as much of that you know small window to get some rather than too much or too little it's a good approach yeah the uh the avoidance is is great and then that gives you sort of more confidence that you can get a little bit and get the right dosage h yeah i i can say that i up to up until a couple of summers ago i was going for up to an hour a day in the sun in the summer and i started to notice some like white bleach spots on on my arm which is characteristic of sun damage so i was like this is too much i got to cut back so now it's at most 30 minutes in the sun um no obviously no burning that's been you know minimized risk that's obvious who would do that ouch but yeah it's fun being in the sun being out you know on the beach it's fun right i i get it you know so yeah so then the the other stuff i mean i this is probably things that you're not going to do just because it's a cream right so i use a tretinoin which is uh retin a is the brand name for that um also that's the prescription which i goes through some hurdles to get a hold of uh retinols are very good those are sort of like the the time proven uh gold standard if you will a cream that then can reduce aging and photo damage and other things i found it to be very frustrating trying to go through the studies to find out what is a good uh anti-aging face cream just because the the great majority of them are funded directly by the seller of the pharmaceutical company um and in general i just can't trust them so i just go with a straight um the sv which has an evening thing and it's got um some very long technical chemical words that supposed to be good for skin and i trust them and let them do the work for it um and then the retina uh the other thing i've done sorted doing for skin is uh cagan i um recently uh for a while i wasn't taking because i thought it was fully digested before it could be absorbed so you're just getting the protein anyway but uh they have found that there are collagen transporters that then can basically transport those amino acids directly as cagan so it's supposed to actually have some benefit for the skin that seem not to have been sponsored by a cagan seller um but it's uh it's something i mean the lots of people are then doing things like you said like they're getting sort of the botox stuff uh many other things to sort of smooth out the face i haven't gone that thing but i'm not sure i still want to see if there's some other way in an earlier um trial period i was doing actually um acid washes um which i kind of like cuz i felt a little um not that manly uh worrying about my face so much so i got rid of some of that by saying well i'm i'm rubbing a sit on my face um which will then give you a red face and kind of uh peel some of it off but i wasn't really convinced that it did it um that much benefit so at this point i'm just um putting on the suntan lotion usually and uh and then getting the retin a and then trying to take the collagin and i'm i'm open i'll probably be doing more advanced things as i get older and have more things that i would like to improve and the skin is tough because it's you know how do you without doing skin biops from all the different regions not just your face you know like because as i mentioned skin physiology may be different at least in terms of ph all over the body yeah you know uh it's tough to quantitatively measure i mean technically you'd have to do one side of your face with your interventions your own your own control huh this the experimental side the control side yeah i mean i'm sure you've seen the truck driver who's in the sun and you can see that there's sun damage on one side of their face but who who's going to do that so that that's kind of the back there for me you know it's how would i sub you know objectively assess if this is working or not you know uh the other side of it too is i'm skeptical because um you know if if the stuff that's been published to quote unquote work regardless of being funded by companies or not which is always a potential compounder but where are the 90 year olds if we look at them or older and we see they look like they've got the skin of a 20-year-old is with all the creams and everything else that we've got going on for decades right so that's a rare thing i don't think i've ever seen a 90 or 100y old where i'm like your skin is a 20-y oldish right you know so yeah well the the movie go ahead i was just gonna say i'm optimistic you know that skin rejuvenation will be a real thing at some point uh and maybe brian you know with his laser treatments maybe i'm behind behind the game maybe he's ahead of the game there and you know that can uh keep the skin young i don't know though i don't know hard to assess they should eventually be able to do that with like the you know stem cells or something and just kind of grow it back i'm looking for when i can get my my hairline back uh from the stem cells right or or or get your hair back you know either way um yeah yeah so i think i think there's going to be still better things are going to come there but i would agree like i don't i don't get the feeling that they have like kind of a one magic solution yet it's sort of uh reactive things at this point that sort of able to slow the tides take care of yourself and then hopefully in the future they will come up with some more of a hail m that just takes care of the thing and fixes any problems you have yeah so i'm most interested in the skin as it's barrier function and as a protective mechanism as a part of the immune system right so skin infections increase during aging and you know the treatments to address those for me that that's where i find the most interest rather than the cosmetic of you know is my skin more elas granted i want to have elastic skin i want to look as youthful as possible if if that's even possible right but you know like my grandmother just anecdotally she was uh like 85 and she had like a chronic skin infection somewhere all of the time and you know it's just her skin barrier function or skin immune defense just i guess weakened over time where stuff could colonize and and and then she's got this perpetual you know uh scab so that to me you know the science of that i find that uh you know most interesting for now in being able you know because is it topical antibiotics is it top topical antifungals for me that's where i see the most interest right now yeah it feels like um as we've been studying the biome and trying to figure out the um the the m gut microbiome is the hardest to access and then after that we have the the oral microbiome but then the skin microbiome seems like it should be able to just you can just sample at any time but at the same time it doesn't seem like they've really figured it out yet so i'm hopeful that that will be something that they are able to then eventually just do a straight diagnosis and say here's how we fix this ah but i've got it the other way so i actually see it as the gut being the easiest to optimize and the oral being a little bit more complicated because it's just less studied and the skin potentially being the hardest as because as i mentioned the skin ph in all the different regions is different you could have a skin microbiome that's different here versus here versus the bottom of the foot and the palms of the hands so you would need to technically sample from all the different regions and specifically target those regions you know for some microbiome specific specific therapy or skin ph therapy or cleanser whatever would be so i see the skin as the hardest of those to optimize h yeah we'll have to see it's going to um access is easier but it could be more complex if you just look at surface right isn't the skin supposed to be one of the largest organs of the body that too that too granted you could say the the intestine you know when you uncoil it it's like you know meters upon meters long longer than we are in height right so it could be you know but yeah that's relatively easy i mean i can go through mechanism but that's another that's a story for another day i guess i think so okay thanks chris for
