## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that dietary oxalate intake is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease cbd related events now if you missed that video i'm going to do a quick review because i'm going to further investigate whether my relatively high dietary oxalate intake may be neutral bad or good for health so in that study we saw that a dietary relatively high dietary oxalate intake in this case with a median value of 277 milligrams per day in tertile 3 was associated with an increased risk for cbd related events as you can see there's a 47 increased risk and that confidence interval 1.02 to 2.12 doesn't overlap with one so that's a significant association so that's in comparison with relatively lower oxalate intakes in this case tertile one which was identified as 120 with a median value of 120 uh milligrams of oxalate per day now we then saw that this association was true for only in people that were on a low calcium diet and a low calcium diet was identified as people who had a median calcium intake of 760 milligrams per day so for those people we can see the significantly increased cbd event risk for both tertile ii and tertile 3 in terms of oxalate intake but in contrast oxalate intake was not associated with cbd event risk in people on medium to high calcium diets with those values being identified as greater than 1180 milligrams of calcium per day and as you can see the oxalate association for oxalate with cvd event risk is now not significant after accounting for relatively higher calcium intakes as that confidence interval the data in parentheses for both tertiary ii and tertile 3 is not uh significantly different when compared with tertile one you can see that the uh the data in parentheses completely overlaps one so it's not statistically significant now we also saw in that video that just from these three foods i eat a lot of spinach beets and carrots i my intake for oxalate is more almost 1400 milligrams per day and i rationalize that based on this study my relatively high oxalate intake might be okay as calcium intake for my most recent blood test average was about 1200 milligrams per day and based on that amount that would put me in tertile three for oxalate intake but that would also put me on a medium calcium diet and we can see that the confidence interval for for that medium calcium with turtle three overlaps with one so it's not significant in other words oxalate intake is not associated with cbd event risk and people on a medium calcium diet but is there a more specific way to evaluate whether oxalate intake may be good bad or neutral for health so with that in mind what's the correlation for dietary oxalate intake with big picture biomarkers from april 2015 through april of 2022 so i know my dietary oxalate intake over that seven year period because i've weighed literally all my food over the past seven years i started tracking my daily diet in april of 2015 and i've continued it for each of the uh every day for the past seven years so i then enter those daily food amounts into chronometer and i'm not sponsored by them any there are many uh nutrition tracking apps they're probably all relatively good so i'm not here to say that chronometer or any of the others are better versus you know in comparison so then chronometer can provide or does provide daily oxalate intake and i can log that or i'd log that in my spreadsheet and then i can then look at associations sorry correlations between oxalate intake with the big big picture biomarkers so before we go there let's take a look at my average daily oxalate intake over the past seven years so we're looking at a lot of red dots and each red dot is the average oxalate intake that corresponds to a blood test for example in between test number one and test number two for uh blood test for 2022 that 49 day period prior to test number two so the the red dot that corresponds to that is the average oxalate intake for that 49 day period so similarly for test number one there was a 42 day period in between blood tests so for that 42 day period the red dot would be the average daily oxalate intake that corresponds to blood test number one and so on for each of these for each of these data points over the past seven years so we can see that my average oxalate intake is relatively high almost 1600 milligrams per day over the over this seven year stretch in contrast tertile three in the previous study the baja duran paper turtle three the highest intake was 277 milligrams of oxalate per day and that was the group that potentially had the highest cbd event risk so we can see that for almost every blood test my average daily oxalate intake is four to eight times higher than tertile three so also note as i mentioned i have up to 36 blood tests for most blood biomarkers over this seven year period so when considering i have dietary oxalate intake for every day over the past seven years and have up to 36 blood tests we can then start to address this question so what's the correlation for oxalate intake with the big picture biomarkers over the past seven years so if you're not familiar what i consider to be these big picture biomarkers uh if you're new to the channel this will be new for you so um but if you're if you're familiar with this i apologize i'm just gonna go go through it relatively quickly so the big picture biomarkers are a panel of blood-based biomarkers uh that i track regularly up to six to eight times per year and they include things like glucose but also homocysteine i haven't figured out where to classify that yet in the big picture biomarker scheme but then three markers of kidney function three markers of liver liver function for all the major lipoproteins uh five immune related cells uh or cell types or actually globulins are in a cell type so uh proteins uh three red blood cell related markers inflammation is indicated by high sensitivity c-reactive protein and the overall biological age score is indicated by levine's phenoage and aging.ei now for a little bit more info you can see a little end next to each biomarker and that's how many blood tests that i have over the past seven years are at the top of the column is the correlation coefficient and then the p-value is the measure of statistical significance or not with a value less than 0.05 being identified as statistically significant so with that in mind what's the correlation for dietary oxalate with these big picture biomarkers so first starting from the top and working working our way down a relatively higher oxalate intake is significantly correlated with higher blood urea nitrogen or bun so i put a red arrow there red arrow there and i'm only going to go through aging data i'm not going to go through aging and all cause mortality uh data because that would be for a very long video so for the for the purpose of this video i'm only going to go through aging data if you're interested in more info you can just do a search for each of these biomarkers and i've explained uh how it changes during aging and the association with all-cause mortality risk so bond levels increase during aging as shown here for both men in green uh in women in blue and you can see that it increases for men with the red line so when considering that a higher oxalate intake is significantly correlated with higher bun this correlation is going in the wrong direction so i gave it a red arrow now a relatively higher oxalate intake is also significantly correlated with higher ldl and ldl also increases during aging as shown here for data in with the men in green and women in red and you can see that youth is characterized by relatively lower levels of ldl and after that it increases for both men and women so that's why i gave it a red arrow all right so then a relatively high oxalate intake is also significantly correlated with higher vldl also a red arrow and that's because vldl increases during aging as shown here so we're looking at data for males as that data directly applies to me i have a video on vldl for that goes through the data from men and women so if you're interested in that yeah check it out so starting from youth in this case 15 to 19 year olds we can see that vldl levels are around 16 milligrams per deciliter and then during aging up to 79 years in this study we can see that vldl levels approximately double so that a higher co oxalate intake is significantly correlated with higher vldl this is going in the wrong direction as higher vldl is found in aging so that's why i gave it a red arrow all right a higher oxalate intake is also significantly correlated with lower lymphocytes at least in my data as shown there by the red arrow and lymphocytes decline during aging as shown here so relatively higher levels of lymphocytes are found in youth and then you can see by the red arrow the red line they decline during aging with statistical significance in the upper left corner so when considering that a higher oxalate intake is significantly correlated with lower lymphocytes in my data lower lymphocytes are found in the aged not during youth so that's why i gave that a red arrow now similarly a relatively higher oxalate intake is also significantly correlated with a lower lymphocyte percentage uh with the lymphocyte percentage being lymphocytes divided by all of the white blood cells so uh lymphocyte percentage also declines during aging as shown here so data for men in green and women in blue and we can see a clear and consistent decline for men for the percentage of lymphocytes now note that that isn't only driven by a lower levels of lymphocytes during aging we can see that also in my data the relatively higher oxalate intake is positively correlated with neutrophils very close to statistical significance you can see it's a has a p-value of 0.06 so it's likely that higher oxalate based on the data looks like higher oxalate is correlated significantly correlated with lower lymphocytes but also right on the verge of significance for higher neutrophils which potentially explains the significant correlation for the lower percentage of lymphocytes so a relatively higher oxalate intake is also simply correlated with higher platelets and i've given that a green line so uh platelets decline during aging so let's take a look so in in relative youth 20 to 30 year olds we can see the platelets are relatively high around 230 231 more specifically and then during aging all the way up to 100 years old we can see that platelet levels decline to less than 210. So when considering that platelet levels decline during aging and when considering that oxalate intake is associated with higher platelets that would be against the aging related trend so that's why i've given it a a green arrow not a green line sorry so to summarize we've got oxalate intake my dietary oxalate intake and it may be different for others but this is what my data shows is significantly correlated with five biomarkers going in the right direction sorry in the wrong direction and only one uh platelets going in the right direction so with that we have a net score of minus four and that suggests that reducing my oxalate intake below my average my seven year average of about 1600 milligrams per day may be better for overall systemic health now note that as i mentioned on the opening slide that relatively higher calcium intakes impact the association for oxalate intake with cbd event risk so what about this question does dietary calcium uh intake affect correlations for oxalate with the big picture biomarkers so i then looked at that and these there's the data there with the correlation coefficient and a p value for the oxalate uh divided by calcium ratio and their correlate this correlation its correlation with the big picture biomarkers so after accounting for calcium intake more specifically this ratio correlations for blood urine nitrogen for ldl and vldl and for lymphocytes and the lymphocyte percentage are no longer statistically significant so that's potentially good news because that suggests that having a relatively higher calcium intake may indeed affect uh how you know oxalate being associated with big picture biomarkers as statistical significance goes away for all five of the red arrows that were only correlated with uh oxalate intake but platelets are still going in the right direction so we've got one green and we've removed basically or the data indicates the removal of five red arrows but we've got new uh correlations that significant correlations that pop up higher oxalate the calcium ratio is now significantly correlated with higher uric acid as shown there and uric acid levels increase during aging this is data for men so in this study it was a longitudinal study for men starting at different ages so whether looking at 20 year olds longitudinally 30 40 50 or 60 year olds uric acid levels increased for each respective age group so that's why i've given that a red arrow because higher oxalate the calcium ratio higher uric acid higher uric acid is found in older relative to younger people so a higher oxalate to calcium ratio is also significantly correlated with higher levels of alkaline phosphatase now whether alkaline phosphatase increases during aging is debatable there are a couple of studies that show that it does increase but also a couple that showed no increase but more definitive is that relatively higher levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with an increased all-cause mortality acm risk and that's what's shown here so this is a study of almost nine million people and when the confidence interval so the dashed lines when they are both completely above a hazard ratio of one as delineated by that red line then we have statistical significance so that becomes a true at an alkaline phosphatase level of 48 above which the correlation the association for alkaline phosphatase with an increased all-cause mortality risk becomes evident so higher levels of alkaline phosphatase above 48 significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering a positive association for the oxalate to calcium ratio with alkaline phosphatase this is going in the wrong direction based on all-cause mortality risk data and then we also have a positive correlation so a higher oxalate to calcium ratio is significantly associated with a higher red blood cell distribution with or rdw and that's potentially a problem because the rdw increases during aging as shown here and you can see the trend line for rdw and how it changes during age so that's given uh i've given that a red arrow because higher rdw found in aged relative to youth so to summarize the oxalate calcium ratio and associations with or correlations with big picture biomarkers we've now got three only three biomarkers going in the wrong direction but one going in the right with a net score of minus two so after accounting for calcium intake dietary oxalate is still significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so with that in mind going forward i'm going to replace spinach where i'm getting about half of my daily oxalate intake with other low oxalate greens in this case collard greens as i prefer the taste of that over other greens like kale and and others all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
