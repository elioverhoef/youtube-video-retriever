An adequate intake for vitamin k for adults 19 years and older for women is 90 micrograms per day and for men it's 120 micrograms per day but is this range 90 to 120 micrograms per day for vitamin k optimal for health so with that in mind i'm going to present data for a paper that was just published earlier this month that looked at the association for vitamin k intake with uh risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease related hospitalization now as a quick note note that this was a relatively large study that had more than 53 000 subjects that had a median age of 56 years and that had a 21-year follow-up now note that vitamin k consists of two main isoforms vitamin k1 and vitamin k2 so with that in mind are vitamins k1 and or k2 associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascbd related hospitalization risk so uh that's what we're looking at here in as a first start so we're looking at the hazard ratio for the total amount of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease related hospitalizations on the y-axis plotted against the vitamin k1 intake on the x-axis now note that when the uh shaded regions are completely below the black line the hazard ratio of one or completely above the black line that indicates a statistically significant effect and what we can see is that for uh people who have eight uh up to 280 micrograms of vitamin k1 per day we see about a 30 decreased risk for the total presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease disease-related hospitalizations now conversely people who ate less than 50 micrograms per day of vitamin k1 had a significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease disease-related hospitalizations now note that these models were adjusted for factors that can impact these associations including age sex bmi smoking status income physical activity alcohol intake and education now also note that the total atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease amount can be subdivided into ischemic stroke ischemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease which essentially is our measures of atherosclerosis in arteries that go to the brain so ischemic stroke ischemic heart disease which is coronary artery atherosclerosis so the plaque buildup and narrowing of arteries that supply the heart which limits a blood and oxygen supply thereby leading to cell death and peripheral artery disease which is atherosclerosis and arteries that go to the limbs so arms and legs and similarly we can see that for people who ate relatively higher amounts of vitamin k1 280 micrograms per day there was a significantly decreased risk for atherosclerosis and arteries that go to the brain heart and limbs for each of these measures now also uh we can also see that for people who ate relatively lower amounts of vitamin k1 less than 50 micrograms per day they had an increased risk for atheroscle hospitalizations related to atherosclerosis for arteries that go to the brain heart or limbs so from that we can conclude that uh 280 micrograms per day of vitamin k1 uh may be optimal for decreasing risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related hospitalization all right so one about what about a vitamin k2 so uh here we're looking at the same measures uh hazard ratio for total atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on the y-axis plotted against the vitamin k intake vitamin k2 intake on the x-axis and uh first note for the total amount of atherosclerotic cardiovascular cardiovascular disease-related hospitalizations and ischemic heart disease related hospitalizations we can see that a k2 intakes in the 60 to around 70 75 range are associated with mass maximally decreased hospitalization risk ischemic stroke is in a similar ballpark not 60 to 75 but somewhere in the 70 to 85 micrograms per day of vitamin k2 is associated with reduced risk of hospitalizations related to ischemic stroke however for peripheral artery disease note that the shaded region overlaps at all parts of of the graph so vitamin k2 intake is not significantly associated with peripheral artery disease hospitalization risk now also note that relatively lower intake so closer to zero and higher than uh about a hundred micrograms of vitamin k k2 per day we're not significantly associated with hospitalization for any of these atheroscle atherosclerosis related hospitalizations so from these data we can conclude that somewhere in the 60 to 80 micrograms per day for vitamin k2 range may be optimal for decrease decreasing risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease related hospitalizations um so based on the data that i've just presented in this paper uh this suggests that the 90 to 120 micrograms per day recommendation that i mentioned on the first slide as an adequate intake for vitamin k may be too low especially when considering that 288 280 micrograms of vitamin k1 and somewhere in the 60 to 80 range for vitamin k2 that's about 350 of vitamin k per day in terms of reducing risk for hospitalizations related to atherosclerosis so uh that suggests that that adequate intake of 90 to 120 grams may be too low for reducing this hospitalization atherosclerosis related hospitalization risk now last but not least what i haven't shown yet is which food sources provided vitamins k1 and k2 in this study so that's what's shown here and for vitamin k1 the primary sources in this study were margarine and lettuce and then relatively small amounts of vitamin k1 were derived from broccoli whole wheat bread and spinach intake now it's important to note that margarine and whole wheat bread are relatively poor sources of vitamin k1 as shown in this small chart here and conversely spinach is the all-star of the foods that are on this list with more than 2 000 micrograms of vitamin k1 per 100 calories so just taking in 15 grams or half an ounce a day of spinach one can reach that 300 microgram or or 280 micrograms of vitamin vitamin k1 that was associated with maximally reduced risk of hospitalization related to atherosclerosis now so for vitamin k2 um we can see that um uh four of the vitamin k2 isoforms so menoquinones mk uh so mk4 mk8 and 9 uh accounted for about 85 or 86 of the total vitamin k2 intake which was derived from eggs butter cheese including hard and soft cheeses uh the soft cheeses including brie and blue cheese now in terms of their vitamin k2 vitamin k2 content per 100 calories and note that most studies reported on a per gram basis but i like to report it on a per calorie basis because if you eat based on grams one can be fooled into thinking they're not eating a lot of calories because they may not be eating a lot of grams so i count everything by calories so that's why i normalize the microgram of k2 data and k1 data per calorie so what we can see on that list is that egg yolk the foods that accounted for most of the k2 intake egg yolk blue cheese brie cheese and butter contain relatively low amounts of vitamin k2 less than 20 micrograms per 100 calories and although the people in this study didn't eat these foods other more rich sources of vitamin k2 include a hard cheddar cheese 70 micrograms per 100 calories cottage cheese four percent cottage cheese four percent fat 52 micrograms per hundred calories uh and full fat gree greek yogurt uh which has uh 28 uh micrograms of vitamin k2 per 100 calories and i'll put the links to the studies that have that data for vitamin k2 in the video's description all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
