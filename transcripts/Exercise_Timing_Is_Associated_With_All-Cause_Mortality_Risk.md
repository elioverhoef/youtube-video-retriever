Moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity or mvpa is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got the adjusted hrs which is the hazard ratio for all cause mortality otherwise known as all-cause mortality risk and on the x-axis we've got total moderate to vigorous physical activity volume in minutes per week now mvpa raises a few questions first how was mvpa calculated in this study it was calculated via accelerometry which was worn on the wrist now an accelerometer is a device that can detect the intensity of motion which then raises another question how was moderate to vigorous physical activity defined now mvpa was defined as activity that was greater than three meds per minute for at least 10 minutes but that raises then another question which exercises are greater than three mets per minute so i've posted a short list here and if you're interested in the full list for mets for metabolic equivalence of task that link will be in the video's description so what we can see is that walking slowly or more specifically at two miles per hour would have mets that were less than three mets per minute so that would not be included in the definition of mvpa for the study but in contrast walking three miles an hour stationary cycling at 50 or 100 watts a leisurely bike ride light to moderate calisthenics or a heavy weightlifting workout would each have mets that were greater than three mets per minute so they will be included in this definition of mvpa for this study all right so now back to our data so how is mvpa volume in minutes per week associated with all cause mortality risk and what so to to assess that we go to a hazard ratio of one and remember where the shaded region is completely below one as in this study or above one we would have a statistically significant association and what we can see is that up to about 175 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week there's about a 65 reduction for all cause mortality risk what about higher than 100 about 175 minutes of mvpa per week well there's a bit of a plateau so people that get more than about 175 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per week did not have a further reduction for all cause mortality risk relative to about 175 minutes per week now note that these data are derived from moderate to vigorous physical activity that are performed at any time during the day and the reason we're here is to ask the question does exercise timing impact all cause mortality risk or more specifically is there a time of day for moderate to vigorous physical activity that may be best for health so in this study they looked at three time points including mourning which was defined as from five in the morning to 11 in the morning midday to afternoon so 11 in the morning until six at night and then in the evening from six at night until midnight and then when going to the data we've once again got the adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality or all cause mortality risk on the y-axis but in this case the x-axis is now different we've got the fraction of moderate to vigorous physical activity within each of these three time windows so what we can see first is that spending up to 50 percent of total moderate to vigorous physical activity time at these three different time points we have significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk so first when looking at the shaded blue region and the median line from midday to afternoon we can see a significantly decreased all-cause mortality risk relative to a hazard ratio of one but then also for the morning and the evening groups that performed about half of their workouts in each of these three time points there was a significant reduction for all cause mortality risk as we can see the shaded blue region for all three time points is below one in other words a mixed approach for exercise timing so not doing exclusively all of your exercise within any of these time points a mixed approach up to 50 was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk but where it gets interesting is for people who spent more than 50 percent of their total exercise time at one or more of these time points so what i mean by that is for example for people who perform more than fifty percent of their total moderate to vigorous physical activity in the midday to afternoon group we see a significant reduction for all cause mortality risk as indicated by the double green arrows however that was not true for people that perform more than half of their total moderate to vigorous physical activity in the morning or in the evening which suggests that midday to afternoon performing the majority of exercise time or a moderate to figure physical activity in the midday to afternoon may be best for reducing all cause mortality risk so as a limitation of that this is an association so is this a correlation or is it causation so to address that we'll have to wait for randomized control trials to see if doing your training only in the midday afternoon may be better for health and reducing all-cause mortality mortality relative to doing the majority of your exercise or your vigorous workouts in the morning or evening all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and
