By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Glutathione isn't the only antioxidant that possibly impacts health others include alpha lipoic acid allene found in garlic and sulforaphane found in broccoli now the common thread through each of these four antioxidants is that they contain sulfur but there's another sulfur containing antioxidant that may be as important or more important and that antioxidant is called ergothioneine so uh whether it's in its reduced form on the left or in its oxidized form on the right we can see that it is a sulfur-containing antioxidant now ergothioneine has been called a longevity vitamin in part because mammals don't synthesize ergothioneine so we need to get it in a diet in order to have adequate amounts so why is it important so first uh ergothioneine levels decline with age and uh their lower levels of ergothioneine are also associated with an increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment so let's have a look at that data so first ergothioneine levels decline during aging so we're looking at plasma levels of ergothioneine on the y-axis plotted against age and we can see the clear decline for ergothioneine levels in plasma during aging now lower erythine is also present in people who have mild cognitive impairment so in subjects that had mci versus that were cognitively normal we can see that the cognitive normal patients had higher levels of ergothionine on the y-axis when compared with people who had mild cognitive impairment now other studies have also shown a similar similar effect of uh lower blood levels of ergothioneine being associated with uh cognitive impairment and also frailty in older adults and that's what we can see here so first starting from uh with cognition with cognitive cognitively impaired in orange and cognitively normal in yellow we can see that the cognitively normal people had relatively higher levels of ergothioneine when compared with cognitive cognitively impaired subjects now similarly for frail versus non-frail we can see that people who were frail had lower levels of blood blood levels of ergothioneine now beyond associations for ergothioneine with cognitive function and frailty are blood levels of ergothioneine associated with a coronary artery disease so atherosclerosis and risk of death from cardiovascular disease and all causes and that's what we can see here so the hr is the hazard ratio and that's risk for uh the incidence of coronary artery artery disease in in red and then the two different shades of green are mortality related to cbd cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality in the other shade of green and what we can see is that the median and ci confidence interval interval are both below one for each of these three outcomes which uh identifies an association for relatively higher levels of ergothionine with a lower incidence of having uh atherosclerosis coronary artery disease and risk of death is also reduced for coronary cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality so higher ergothane less uh risk for these three outcomes so with that in mind can and when considering that mammals don't produce ergothioneine can diet impact blood levels of a refining so first we need to know which foods contain uh this antioxidant ergothioneine so uh that's we're looking at here erithionine on the y-axis in milligrams of ergothioneine per kilogram of food and uh that's a dry weight of the food so uh first we can see that oats and kidney beans contain relatively low amounts around two milligrams per kilogram of their these respective foods oat bran has about double or a little more than double than oats and kidney beans and then chicken liver has ten times more ergothionine than oat bran and then tempe has even more than chicken uh chicken liver 201 milligrams per kilogram but uh what should be obvious is that the highest amounts of regathening on this chart are for mushrooms so white button mushrooms and great oyster mushrooms have 630 milligrams and 1.3 grams of ergothioneine per kilogram of their dry weight so uh mushrooms are a rich source of ergothione based on on on this study now another study looked at 15 different species of mushroom and we can see that uh seven of them have over 300 milligrams of ricothianine per kilogram dry weight which would again put them at the far right side of the uh of the chart now also in that study they identified decent amounts of ergothioneine and garlic and also in a mexican asparagus which is the greenish asparagus that's normally sold in stores uh and the reason i indicated uh where it's from is because the white asparagus contains significantly lower amounts of ricothianine although i didn't indicate it on the chart so uh when considering that mushrooms are a rich source of ergothioneine do does mushroom intake correlate with blood levels of ergothioneine and that's what we can see here and it does so we're looking at whole blood levels of our methionine on the y-axis plotted against consumption of mushrooms in terms of times per month and this is self-reported data and we can see that people who reported eating more mushrooms had higher blood levels significantly higher blood levels of ergothionine so with that in mind an obvious question should be is mushroom intake reduced in the patients that had mild cognitive impairment so uh that's what we can see here and uh it wasn't so uh even though it looks like mci patients had uh less when they uh compared the statistics between the two groups those that were caught had mild cognitive impairment did not consume less mushrooms when compared with cognitively normal subjects so if diet isn't responsible for the lower levels of ergothioneine in mci patients what other factors are contributing and it's important to note that gut bacteria make ergothioneine so which gut bacteria produce ergothioneine so in this study they looked at uh fecal levels of ergothioneine so the amount of ergothioneine in poo and then compared it against uh fecal amounts of the bacterium lactoba lactobacillus rutary and what we can see is that the higher the levels of lactobacillus rutary uh in in poo the higher the fecal levels of ergothioneine and this was a very strong correlation as you can see by the correlation coefficient of 0.83 and it's a statistically significant now correlation doesn't equal causation so you know th this just identifies a correlation for el rootery with ergothioneine levels but is there more direct evidence for el rootery actually producing ergothioneine so that's what the authors of this study then uh sought uh sought to do and on the left we're looking at uh ergothi so this is a cell culture experiment where they uh looked at uh lactobacillus rotary in cell culture so first on the left they measured ergothioneine levels in lactobacillus rootary and in a bacterium that they didn't expect to have ergothioneine e coli so what we can see compared to uh for comparing these six different strains all of them that start with jcm of lactobacillus rotary when compared with e coli we can see that the lactobacillus rutary have about three fold higher levels of ergothioneine inside of them than e coli now just because lactobacillus rotary have more ergothionine inside of them than e coli doesn't mean that they'll release it out out from from you know from their bacterium so uh to test that lactobacillus rutary release it they then measured the amount of of ergothioneine in the uh supername of of the cell culture the cell culture medium and so that's we're looking at here on the right so first uh note that uh e coli for e coli there was no extracellular release of ergothioneine i mean it's not there's nothing there but then for the six different strains of lactobacillus rotary all the strains weren't equal in terms of their ability to release ergothioneine into the cell media uh so four of the six strains uh when compared with the negative control gam uh released uh decent amounts of ergothioneine into the cell media and actually note that for two of the lactobacillus strains they released uh four and uh up to five-fold more organine when compared with the negative control so uh with when considering all of these data and that blood levels of ergothioneine decline during aging is this because of a dietary insufficiency not eating enough ergothioneine-rich foods or an age-related decline for el rootery so as a summary and a hypothesis of everything i've shown so if we eat more mushrooms or other ergothioneine-rich foods we should expect to see higher blood levels of ergothioneine and blood levels of ergothioneine decline during aging and if we increase our blood levels of ergothionine based on the association data we would expect to see a reduced risk for cognitive impairment frailty atherosclerosis and mortality from cardiovascular disease and all causes alternatively or in addition to if we supplement with el rotari which produces ergothioneine or consume foods that increase its levels including kefir and i've indicated the citation that uh showed that and i'll put all of the papers for the video in the description so if you're interested in the data the published data just please check the description uh for the video so eat more mushrooms and or get more l rotary in the diet may be an important means for increasing blood or refining and for reducing risk for all of these aging related outcomes now it's important to note that randomized controlled trials rcts have yet to test this hypothesis so i'd stay tuned for the for the data on ergothioneine it's a it's an emerging field uh so it'll be interesting to see how the studies pan out so that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
