Carotenoids are associated with a younger epigenetic age and a reduced all-cause mortality risk so let's have a look at that data so first we can see that blood levels of carotenoids the total level of carotenoids and blood is negatively correlated with dna and grim age which stands for dna methylation and it's the grim age epigenetic clock and in the bicore column we can see that that correlation is negative which means that the higher the blood levels of carotenoids the younger the epigenetic age and that data is in a study of about 2 300 subjects in the n column and it's a statistically significant correlation as indicated by the p or p value now carotenoids isn't just one metabolite it contains a group of five metabolites so how does the data look for the five individual carotenoids with uh epigenetic age as indicated by grim age so the carotenoids lycopene alpha carotene beta carotene lutein plus zeaxanthin and beta cryptoxanthin uh each of them and all of them were significantly negatively correlated with epigenetic age which means that the higher the blood levels of each of these uh carotenoids the younger the epigenetic age now there currently aren't any uh randomized controlled trials that have looked at any of these carotenoids or all of them for their ability to cause decreases in epigenetic age for now it's just the correlation but when considering that these metabolites are found in foods it seems like a low risk potentially high reward system to optimize epigenetic age as one aspect of biological age so with the goal of slowing epigenetic aging which foods contain these carotenoids and that's what we can see here so let's go through them uh one by one so first alpha carotene is found uh uh primarily in carrots pumpkin winter squash plantains and collard greens and for me i get the majority of my daily alpha carotene about 15 milligrams per day from uh 416 an average of 416 grams per day for carrots and that's the average value for the about the two month period that corresponded to my latest blood test that i took in early march similarly uh carrots are my predominant source of getting beta-carotene as beta-carotene also are rich in carrots green green leafy greens it says leafy greens there which trip me up a bit sweet potato cantaloupe or actually orange sweet potato cantaloupe and pumpkin lycopene as we probably all know is is popularized in tomatoes but it's also rich in watermelon and other foods like papaya and grapefruit so as we can see i get the majority of my lycopene from watermelon uh 134 grams per day gives me about five to seven milligrams of lycopene per day lutein and zeaxanthin is found primarily in leafy greens summer and winter squash brussels sprouts and also yellow corn and i get the majority of my lutein plus a xanthan uh with spinach and broccoli and that's about somewhere about 25 to 30 milligrams per day of lutein plus zeaxanthin and then beta cryptoxanthin is found primarily in pumpkin papaya uh red bell peppers sweet peppers uh orange and carrots and i get the majority of my beta cryptoxanthin about two milligrams per day from my red bell pepper intake now is is grim age a good epigenetic clock i mean seeing a correlation between carotenoids with grim age is interesting but if grim age isn't actually a good epigenetic clock then who cares right so as we can see in the title though a younger grim age is a the epigenetic age for grim age is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk and the title of this paper says it all so the title is grim age outperforms other epigenetic clocks in the prediction of age-related clinical phenotypes and all-cause mortality and we can see the data under the title where the uh authors of this study compared various epigenetic clocks in this case horvas epigenetic clock which is the best of the bunch for predicting chronological age but based on this data it's not the best for predicting all-cause mortality risk uh and then they looked at other epigenetic clocks the hanum clock levine's phenoage methylation clock and then grimage and so of these four uh methylation epigenetic clocks grimage was the only one that uh identified a significant association between an older epigenetic age through grim age with an increased all-cause mortality mortality risk which is what we can see by the 1.91 hazard ratio so a 91 increased risk with an older uh epigenetic agent indicated by grim age so what i've shown you so far is that cumulatively these data uh suggest that higher blood levels of carotenoids may reduce uh epigenetic age lead to a younger epigenetic age and then a younger epigenetic age is indicated by grim age is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk now the links in this chain that i haven't shown you yet uh are the you know are higher blood levels of carotenoids associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk just by themselves so let's have a look at data and actually that is true so higher blood levels of carotenoids have been shown to be associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk so first in looking at the data for total carotenoids and blood in a meta-analysis of seven studies and all the data i'm going to show in this slide are based on meta-analysis um with a variety of studies from two studies up to uh seven or eight studies so first looking at the total amount of carotenoids in blood we can see that the higher the levels of blood carotenoids the lower the risk for all-cause mortality in this case it looks very linear so the higher your blood levels of the carotenoids you should see a continued reduction in all-cause mortality risk all the way up to about 180 milligrams per deciliter for blood carotenoids and that's compared with lower intakes you know say 20 milligrams per deciliter in blood now what about the individual carotenoids so first looking at beta carotene and blood again meta-analysis of eight studies we can see that there's a significant uh decrease in all-cause mortality risk uh for higher levels blood levels of beta-carotene uh and that's when compared with lower intake say at about 10 milligrams per deciliter so what about the other carotenoids so alpha carotene similar story higher blood levels of alpha-carotene lower all-cause mortality risk uh and also that's true for beta-cryptoxanthin as we can see there and then uh lycopene too now of all the carotenoids the only two that were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk and one reason may be because of a limited amount of studies was lutein and zeaxanthin so in two studies uh these carotenoids were not associated with all-cause mortality risk uh now unfortunately dna grimage is not commercially available that's not the uh epigenetic test that you see that's all over the internet all over the interwebs uh that people are measuring their epigenetic age so is there a link between carotenoids with the clinical biomarkers which uh as if you watch this channel i spend a lot of time on uh levine's phenotypic age calculator which is based on clinical biomarkers or uh more uh easily available clinic cl sorry clinical biomarkers that you get when you go to the you know to the doctor uh once a year or more so uh is there a link between the carotenoids with clinical biomarkers so uh this is my data in my blood test data so this is a 28 blood test from 2015 to 2021 so the past six years 28 blood tests and we can see it's the association between albumin serum levels of abdomen on the y-axis with my average daily beta-carotene intake on the x-axis and what we can see is that the higher my average daily beta-carotene intake is the higher my levels of albumin are and that's a significant correlation with the p-value of 0.008 with the correlation coefficient moderate strength uh 0.6 now why is at why albumin why is albumin important as a biomarker well it's present in four separate predictors of biological age and i should mention that in each of these studies the the authors of the of the study uh the scientists didn't go and say all right i'm going to put albumin in my uh biological age predictor they let the stats identify the composite of biomarkers that best explain biological age and in each of these four different studies albumin was picked by the stats so those studies are levine's phenotypic age albumin is found in that it's found in aging.ai uh there was a calorie restriction a randomized control trial rct that i did a video on i'll link to that in the right corner if you're interested in that and then there was a fourth uh study uh waziri in 20 2019 that included abdomen as a predictor of biological age so in terms of biological age it's an important biomarker now higher levels of albumin are associated with youth and that's what we can see here in a study of more than one million subjects we can see that higher levels of albinism were found in youth whereas relatively lower levels were found at advanced uh ages and it declines during aging now not only does uh albumin decline during aging uh which illustrates its importance but higher levels of albumin which are found in youth are also associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk in the oldest old and that's what we can see here so uh just to break down this data it it was uh groups of older adults from 85 to older than 105 years old and in the three different uh brackets that you've got here it's 85 to 99 years 100 to 104 years old and then people who are older than 105 years and what they did is they looked at uh clinically relevant biomarkers in this situation hdl ldl hemoglobin a1c creatinine egfr but using creatinine to determine egfr not cystin c c reactive protein but not high sensitivity c reactive protein and then abdomen so they compared each of these clinically relevant biomarkers for their association with all-cause mortality risk for each of these age groups at advanced stages and of these biomarkers the only one that was consistently um significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk at every age all of these ages was albumin so higher levels of admin were associated with a lower all-cause and mortality risk for each of the age groups now not only that the magnitude of the uh of this effect was most pronounced for albumin at all of the age groups too so starting from the 85 to 99 year olds we see a 27 reduction uh for all-cause mortality risk with higher albumin 26 uh percent reduction for the 100 104 year-olds and then a 34 reduction in all-cause mortality risk for uh the uh people who are older than 105. So in other words the higher your albumin the lower your risk of mortality even at the extremes of of lifespan so just as a quick summary uh i showed you that uh oh i didn't show you but carotenoids rich foods would be expected to increase blood levels of carotenoids higher blood levels of carotenoids are correlated with a younger epigenetic age and younger epigenetic age as as measured by dna m grim age is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk separately carotenoid-rich foods including beta-carotene and my data is correlated with increased serum levels of albumin and higher levels of albumin are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality so when considering all of these data it seems like a wise strategy to include carotenoids carotenoid rich foods into our diet all right that's all i've got for now uh if you made it to the end uh thanks a lot i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
