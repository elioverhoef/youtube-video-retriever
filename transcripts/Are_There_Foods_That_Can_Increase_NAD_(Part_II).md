# Are There Foods That Can Increase NAD? (Part II)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Nad impacts the health and function of many organ systems but it declines during aging so how can we increase nad one strategy involves diet and more specifically by including foods that contain cd38 inhibitors so why cd 38 inhibitors cd38 increases during aging as shown by the red line and when considering that it's a nad ace which means that it degrades nad that's one contributing factor to why nad levels decline during aging so uh cd38 inhibitors include epigenin and quercetin and i've covered uh them in a previous video if you're interested in that you can click on the link in the right corner but there are others including luteiolin luteolinidin and coromanon so then the obvious question should be how do these flavonoids compare against apigenin and quercetin as cd38 inhibitors and that's what was explored in this study so what we're looking at as the metric for uh cbe human cd38 activity is the ic50 and the ic50 is how much of a substance is needed to inhibit cd38 in this example by 50 so it's the half maximal inhibitory concentration and in this case a lower concentration would be better because that shows that you need less of a substance to inhibit half of its activity and higher values would be worse because you need more of that substance to inhibit half of its activity and what we can see is that the three uh flavonoids on this list that have the lowest ic50 values for inhibiting cd38 are luteolinidine coromanon and luteolin at six to eight uh micromolar now interestingly they looked at also they also looked at quercetin on this list and that's what we can see here that the ic54 corsetin was about 38 micromolar so just when looking at luteolinidine and coromanon those two flavonoids are about six times more effective at inhibiting cd38 than quercetin and luteolin is about four to five times better now another study looked at cd38 activity uh versus the quercetin concentration and we can see that from the half maximal concentration there that the ic54 core settings ability to inhibit cd38 in this study was about was significantly lower about 13 micromolar nonetheless uh each of those three flavonoids luteolinidine coromanin and luteolin had ic50 values that were lower than 13 micromolar so based on these two studies a lower concentration of these three flavonoids would be needed when compared with quercetin to inhibit cd38 so what about epigenin how do these flavonoids compare against apigenin uh for their ic50 values to inhibit cd38 so in this study or or in this data we're looking at cv38 activity again on the y-axis plotted against the epigenin concentration and when looking at the ic50 value uh we can see that apigenin's ic54 inhibiting cd38 in this data was about 12 micromolar so again uh the three flavonoids on the list have lower levels lower ic50 values for inhibiting cd38 when compared with apigenin's 12 micromolar in this study so from this we can conclude that luteolinidine coromanin and luteolin are better inhibitors of cd38 than epigenetic and quercetin so which foods contain these three different flavonoids so i'm going to start with kermanen and luteolin because uh the ability to get them through food may be uh more easily obtained based on foods that are more uh commercially available uh so we'll see why that's the case in a second so first uh kermanon so it's most abundant in black elder belly black elderberries at uh 700 about 740 milligrams per 100 grams of fresh weight uh but it's also found in a lower amounts but still relatively high amounts in blackberries 140 milligrams of chromatin per 100 grams of fresh blackberries so uh does caromanit although it impa it inhibits cd38 does that inhibition lead to higher levels of nad and as far as i can see there's only one study that's looked at that if anybody's come across other studies please leave a comment uh below and and uh we can all share the knowledge so uh in this study this is a in an in vitro study that they looked at cells uh and on the y-axis is the intracellular nad concentration and uh so starting at uh time zero zero hours they then induce these cells to differentiate and we can see that the nad levels declined after six hours of differentiation however in the cells that were treated with coromanin there was no decrease in nad as shown there and in fact uh you know small increase in nad levels likely because of coromannon's role as a cd38 inhibitor now luteolin is found in these foods here so it's found most abundantly in dried mexican oregano about 11 milligrams of luteolin per gram it's found in celery seeds 7.6 milligrams of luteolin per gram and then also in lower amounts in radicchio now although radicchio has you know significantly lower amounts on a per gram basis 0.38 milligrams per gram one can eat you know more of that uh to get the similar amounts that are found in celery seeds or dried mexican oregano so if you eat 20 grams of radicchio which isn't much you get to 7.6 milligrams per gram the amount that's found in celery seeds and if you eat about an ounce of radicchio you get to the amounts that are found in one gram of dried mexican oregano now uh does luteolin impact levels of nad and there are no studies uh that have yet explored that uh if there are please again leave a comment and let's share that knowledge but i did a pretty extensive search and i didn't find any studies for that now uh last but not least luteolinident is found in black sorghum and in this study they looked at uh eight different varieties of black sorghum which is a grain and they found that the average uh luteal lineadin concentration was 167 micrograms per gram now uh red sorghum is also uh sold and uh it's important to note that it has uh significantly lower amounts of luteolinidine and in some cases some varieties don't have any lined in so if your goal is to get luteal lined into your diet and you're going to use red sorghum to do that you may be buying a variety that doesn't have any luteal linident in it and i should also mention that lutely linoden is relatively hard to find oh sorry black sorghum is relatively hard to find at least online uh i can only find one store that sold it and it was sold out when i when i you know uh looked into buying some so uh does luteo lennon then impact levels of nad so uh that's what we're going to look at here uh so we we've got a levels of nad or nadh on the y-axis against three different experimental conditions the controls and i should mention this is in rat heart uh so controls rat hearts that were exposed to ischemia plus reperfusion ir i slash r and then ischemia plus reprofusion in the presence of luteal linidin so first when starting at the control condition for nad which are the black bars we can see that rat hearts exposed to ischemia plus reperfusion had a significant decline of nad uh you know up to more about 50 percent or a little bit more however rat hearts that were exposed to ischemia plus reperfusion but also supplemented in the media with luteolinidin uh had increased nad when compared to just uh ischemia reperfusion in the absence of lutealinogen so from this we can conclude that nad levels are increased after exposure to luteal anidine now the big question is how much of these foods should we eat to inhibit cd38 and maximize nad in people now that's unknown there are no human rcts that have explored these foods uh to be able to impact nad levels in people and it also depends on many factors including absorption you know we can calculate based on the amounts of these flavonoids that can inhibit cd38 uh to come up with a a predicted amount of food that could get you enough to be able to maximally inhibit cd38 but then again absorption uh whether or not all of these flavonoids would be absorbed and how much of it would be absorbed will likely vary depending on the individual so uh but i'd argue that a strategy that contains foods uh and maybe a variety of these foods that contain cd38 inhibitors may be an important strategy for attenuating the age-related decline for nad so in other words it doesn't have to be just dried parsley parsley chamomile you know onions and dill epigenetic and quercetin based on these studies there are other uh foods that contain cd38 inhibitors that may be able to help us increase our energy levels or at least fight the age-related decline for nad levels all right that's all i've got for now uh thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
