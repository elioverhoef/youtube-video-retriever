# Kynurenine/Tryptophan Ratio: More Insight Into The De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that tryptophan is converted into nad by the de novo nad synthesis pathway but an age-related decline for vitamin b6 and more specifically paradoxyl 5-phosphate or plp may limit conversion of tryptophan into nad so with the goal of increasing intracellular levels of nad and reversing the age-related decline how can we gain more insight about this pathway now a first step would be to measure intracellular levels of nad and i've done that by sending blood samples to ginfinity now four times and i put the latest video in that series in the right corner many commercial labs measure plasma levels of vitamin b6 so that's another option and similarly many commercial labs provide measurement of tryptophan but what about chin uranine so with that in mind last month i sent blood for at-home metabolomics with iolo which provided data for communion and tryptophan but also data for more than 500 metabolites including metabolites related to aging and longevity including poly means bile acids and many others and i'll have more on that in future videos if you're interested in using iolo for at-home metabolomics there'll be a discount link in the video's description now back to our story for kanyearning and tryptophan and that's important because kind you're needing to trip the fan ratio increases during aging and is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so let's have a look at that data and that's what we can see here the kind you're need to trip the fan ratio or ktr increases during aging so in this study of about a thousand people people that had a median age of 59 years at baseline provided a blood sample their ktr was calculated and then 11 years later they also provided a blood sample ktr was calculated and there we can see a significant increase for the chin urinine to tryptophan ratio during aging and that's potentially important because a higher ratio for chin uranine divided by tryptophan is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and that's what we're going to see here on the y-axis we've got the hazard ratio or all-cause mortality risk plotted against the ktr on the x and then we put up our hazard ratio of one where we can see that lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with the chin urine to tryptophan ratio of 15 to 23 and more specifically we can see that the stars the green stars are completely below one so the shaded region that's where the shaded region is completely below once we have a statistically significant association when the chin urinated tryptophan ratio is 15 to 23. Conversely the shaded region is completely above one in this case or increase all cause mortality risk when the chimera need to trip the fan ratio is greater than 26. So with that in mind what's my kind you're a need to trip the fan ratio based on iola's data my circulating levels of chinine were 0.74 micromolar my circulating levels of tryptophan 31.57 micromolar to get a ratio of 23.4 nanomolar per micromolar now to put these data onto this chart i would be somewhere there so at best a small but significant decrease for all cause mortality risk at best at worst no association with all cause mortality risk so my data could be a little bit better and that would be by reducing the kinurney trip to tryptophan ratio somewhere towards the middle where you can see that that will be associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk because somewhere around 20 for a ktr so how will i do that well when considering that b6 may be the block in converting tryptophan through chin urine into nad if i increase if i further increase vitamin b6 intake and i'm currently at about 35 milligrams per day three times higher than my last test for nad if i further increase my b6 intake will that reduce the kind you're need to trip the fan ratio and correspondingly increase nad so stay tuned for that data i plan on testing in a couple of weeks so that data should be out sometime in june all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel of 17 biomarker biomarkers is almost exclusively different from at-home metabolomics so they're complementary tests diet tracking with chronometer or if you want to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatron brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
