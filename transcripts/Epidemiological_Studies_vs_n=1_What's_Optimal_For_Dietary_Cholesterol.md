Dietary intake of cholesterol what's optimal so first let's have a look at some epidemiological studies so here we can see heart disease mortality risk plotted on the y-axis against dietary cholesterol intake on the x-axis and this was a study of about 37 000 people that had an average age of about 50 years with an eight year follow-up so when compared with the dotted line when the shaded gray region is either completely above that or completely below that we have a statistical significance so when compared with the referent which was defined as a bit below 200 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day we can see that relatively higher values and also relatively lower values were not statistically associated with heart disease mortality risk so does that mean i can eat as much cholesterol as i want let's have a look at some more more studies so in a similarly sized study this in this case about 30 000 subjects pretty close to about the same age 52 years old in this study but had a longer follow-up 18 years they looked at the incidence of cvd cardiovascular disease which was defined as fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease stroke heart failure and cardiovascular deaths from other causes and then they divided their data into five quintiles so zero to 114 milligrams of cholesterol per day 114 174 quintile 2 175 to 229 quintile 3 230 to 300 uh quintile 4 and then greater than 300 quintill 5. So when compared with the reference which in this case was defined as low cholesterol so less than 114 milligrams per day we can see that quintile 2 and quintile 3 were not significantly different which suggests that cholesterol in dietary cholesterol intakes from 114 to 229 milligrams per day are not significantly different in terms of the incidence of cbd related outcomes when compared with lower intake so less than 114 milligrams per day in contrast now we see a statistical significance you can see those confidence intervals are at one or higher for both quintile four and quintile five so more than 230 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day is associated with a higher risk for incident cvd when compared with relatively lower cholesterol intake so less than 114 milligrams per day so which now we have two studies with somewhat contrasting data in one study we have dietary cholesterol is not significantly associated with heart disease mortality risk and in the second study we have more than 230 is associated with a high risk for incident cvd related outcomes so which study is closer closer to the truth so heart disease mortality risk is only one outcome what about the association for all cause mortality risk which includes death from all causes with dietary cholesterol intake so i'm going to look at that data from these same two studies so first when looking at the sia study now we're looking at all-cause mortality risk plotted against dietary intake of cholesterol on the x and now we can see with the p-values we have statistical significance so when dietary cholesterol intake was 235 milligrams per day that was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk an increase a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk was associated with dietary cholesterol intakes that were less than 184 milligrams per day and then higher values so higher than 235 uh so dietary cholesterol intakes that were higher than 235 milligrams per day were not significantly associated with an uh increased all-cause mortality risk or with any uh effect on all-cause mortality risk so are these findings consistent with other studies so let's have a look at the zhong study so again we're looking at all-cause mortality risk model one is the least adjusted model model two has uh more variables that were adjusted for and model three is the fully adjusted model and we again we have these five quintiles of dietary cholesterol intake so when compared with that referent which was uh zero to 114 milligrams per day of dietary cholesterol again we see that relatively low intakes are not associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and then although we see model one for 230 to 300 milligrams per day for dietary cholesterol intake is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk we can see that when further variables are included uh or adjusted for so model two and model three that statistically statistical significance is lost but now we see in quintile five in each of the models so the model one two and three we have uh that dietary cholesterol intakes uh 301 to 453 milligrams per day are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with the lower intake so less than milligrams per day so now we have contradictory findings in one study we have less than 104 84 milligrams per day dietary cholesterol is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and in contrast relatively lower in the other study relatively lower intakes of cholesterol were not associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk similarly in the cia study we have relatively higher cholesterol intakes dietary cholesterol intakes are not associated with an increased all-cause mortality but then in the jungle study we have someone opposite data where uh cholesterol intakes greater than 300 milligrams per day are significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so how can we get closer to the truth here so to evaluate whether relatively low or relatively higher intakes for dietary cholesterol are optimal i can investigate correlations for dietary cholesterol with big picture biomarkers in other words we can now change this title into epidemiological studies versus my own end of one data and we can then try to evaluate what's optimal in terms of a dietary cholesterol intake based on my own data so to get there it's important that i go through a relatively quick review so i've been tracking my daily diet since 2015. So what does that mean so i've weighed literally all of my food using a food scale and then those food amounts are entered into a chronometer and i'm not sponsored by them so any uh online software you know myfitnesspal or there may be others will basically you know do the similar job and then that output data from chronometer is entered i enter it uh and that data includes macro micronutrients and the individual food amounts i enter that into a spreadsheet every day it only takes me about five minutes a day it's not that time consuming all right so then the average dietary intake for the time in between blood tests then corresponds to the next blood test so what that means is if i blood test on day one and blood test on day 60 for the 59 day period in between blood tests the average dietary intake for that period then corresponds to the blood test on day 60. So with enough blood tests and with enough corresponding dietary data for each blood test i can then look for correlations between my diet with the blood test variables and c try to see what's optimal so that's what what i've stated here so then i investigate correlations between the blood biomarkers with diet so let's take a quick look at my average daily cholesterol intake and this is since i started tracking in april of 2015 all the way up until uh yesterday so october 8th and so i have 32 blood tests during that six and a half year period and each blue dot corresponds to my average diet average daily dietary cholesterol intake that corresponds to a blood test so my range is somewhat wide and that's good uh you know because we can evaluate you know the effect of relatively lower amounts or somewhat higher amounts on the big picture biomarkers as i'll go over in a second and then my average dietary cholesterol intake during this time has been 143 milligrams per day so within my own data uh is dietary cholesterol significantly associated with these quote unquote big picture biomarkers so what are the big picture biomarkers so i've delineated them here there are 23 markers that i regularly track and i blood test six times a year or potentially more if i decide to go more often so let's just go through what they include so i've got glucose and homocysteine group together but i probably won't group them together in a future video but homocysteine can pretty much go in its own category so they include glucose as a marker of insulin resistance slash sensitivity three markers of kidney function creatinine uric acid and blood urine nitrogen bun four markers of liver function lipoproteins immune cells red blood cell related markers inflammation including high sensitivity c reactive protein and then the overall biological age score as computed by levine's phenoage and aging.ai so note that with the exception of homocysteine lipoprotein a and c c reactive protein these biomarkers are found on the standard chemistry panel plus cbc which is a less than 35 test so it's relatively affordable to assess multiple organ systems now so correlations for average daily cholesterol intake with these big picture biomarkers what do we see so uh we can see that the higher my dietary intake of cholesterol that's correlated with a higher glucose and as we all know higher glucose is potentially bad for aging so that's i've indicated that by a red arrow going in the wrong direction similarly going in the wrong direction are higher levels of creatinine and blood urine nitrogen um and if anybody's curious for how i'm determining what's optimal in terms of going in which direction or not i have many videos and articles on my own website that delineate what's optimal for most of these biomarkers so creatinine and bun higher levels of that are correlated with higher intakes of dietary cholesterol in my own data and i should mention the number of blood tests is indicated by the little n next to each biomarker all right so then also going in the wrong direction are neutrophils which increase during aging and the lymph percentage of lymphocytes which decline during aging so in sum we've got a higher average dietary cholesterol intake is significantly correlated with five biomarkers going in the wrong direction what about biomarkers potentially going in the right direction well uh levels of ast and alt relatively high levels of that are going in the wrong direction so we can see that having a relatively higher dietary cholesterol intake is correlated with lower levels of these liver enzymes so i've got them indicated by green going in the right direction also going in the right direction are platelets platelets increase during sorry place decrease during aging so uh that this is a positive correlation would potentially uh slow that down um to have them going you know in a direction opposite from aging and then also going in the right direction are red blood cells which also decline during aging so a higher intake of dietary cholesterol is significantly correlated with higher levels of red blood cells so in sum we've got correlations significant correlations for a higher average daily cholesterol intake with four biomarkers going in the right direction now what i haven't indicated here is also ldl which there's a significant positive correlation there so is higher or lower ldl optimal for health and my average ldl since uh april of 2015 over 32 blood tests is 89 milligrams per deciliter which based on the epidemiological studies and i'll link to that video in the right corner would put me at an increased all-cause mortality risk so if relatively low ldl is bad for health in my case i can't say if this would be true for others we'd expect to see this reflected in the data for this the big picture biomarker so let's have a look at the correlations for ldl with my big picture biomarkers to see if relatively higher amounts or lower amounts may be optimal so in terms of correlations for ldl with the big picture biomarkers we can see that it's significantly correlated with five biomarkers going in the wrong direction so glucose creatinine blood and nitrogen neutrophils and the percentage of lithocytes but also four going in the right direction now we see a significant uh correlation for ldl with lower homocysteine lower uh liver enzymes ast and alt and also higher red blood cells and note that this pattern is very similar to the one on the previous slide for dietary cholesterol with the big picture biomarkers but yet it's ldl so uh the net score five going in the right direction but in the wrong direction and four going in the right direction that net score between the two is -1 which suggests that a relatively lower ldl in my case again and correspondingly lower dietary cholesterol may be optimal so going back to the correlations for the dietary cholesterol with the big picture biomarkers now we can see that i put a red arrow next to ldl as somewhat a little bit below my uh uh average for the past six six and a half years may be optimal for ldl so just to sum that up now we've got six biomarkers going in the wrong direction for its correlation with dietary cholesterol intake four going in the in the right direction and that net score is minus two so this suggests again as i mentioned for ldl that a dietary cholesterol intake that is a bit below my six and a half year average but not my lowest so if that net score was minus four minus three minus five i would shoot for my lowest intake for dietary cholesterol similarly if it was zero if i had an equal amount of biomarkers going in the right and the wrong direction i would shoot for my average dietary cholesterol intake and if i had a net score of say plus two plus one plus three something positive i would shoot for higher dietary cholesterol intakes that's what the biomarkers would suggest so going back to my data for dietary cholesterol intake when considering that my average was is 143 million milligrams per day and its correlation with the big picture big picture biomarkers is minus two that suggests that i should shoot for somewhere a little bit below my average somewhere around 100 milligrams per day now whether this will be uh truly optimal i'll be able to reevaluate this with more data with more blood tests with more tracking of my diet and we'll see if somewhere in the 100 to 143 range or somewhere a little bit lower than 100 milligrams per day will be optimal all right that's all for now if you made it to the end thanks for watching and if you're interested in more data come check us out on patreon you can see all of my attempts to biohack aging see you in the next video have a great day
