# 15y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #7 in 2024; Test #36 Since 2018)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind in late october i blood tested for the seventh time in 2024 and note that this is test number 55 since august of 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age that's what we'll see here this is using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag and this test is important for many reasons one is that it's associated with chronological age or strongly associated with chronological age a higher biological age using this test is associated with an increased risk of death for all causes and it includes multiple biomarkers of many different organ systems which addresses the central premise of this channel in terms of those biomarkers they include two markers of liver health and function so alimin and alkaline phosphatase alp kidney function creatinine met iic health glucose inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein two measures related to white blood cells wbc's the lymy percentage which is total lymphocytes divided by wbc's and obviously wbc's and then two measures of or related to red blood cells the mcv which is the average red blood cell volume and then the rdw or red blood cell distribution width which is a measure of the variation in red blood cell volume so if you want to calculate your own biological age using this test there's a free downloadable excel file so you can calculate it whenever you want you don't have to use enter an email like some other online sites do uh there's a downloadable link in a link for my blog or my website in the video description so when entering these data i get a biological age of 36.5 years which is 15.2 years younger than the chronological now the theoretical maximum reduction for chronological age versus biological age using this test is 20 years so 15 years younger is about 75% of the maximum reduction that one can have using this test so not bad but note that this is just one test and it's important to not get too high or too low with just one test because in my opinion tracking year-to-year change is more important so with that in mind let's take a look at biological age results using this test since 2018 as i have 36 tests over that time period which is what we'll see here so in 2018 and 2019 i tested three times with an average biological age of 36.1 years but then three tests over a 2-year span is probably not enough data to track year-to-year change so i started testing more often for t six tests each in 2020 and 2021 biological age using this metric was 35.6 years so 35.6 at that time was probably a closer representation to a full year average relative to the 36.1 in 2018 to 2019 i then started to increase testing adding a seventh test in 2022 and i had had my best data yet with an average biological age of 33.8 years in 2023 it got a small amount worse 34.7 years over seven tests and over the first seven tests thus far in 2024 it's close to the same as last year 34.9 so note that even if all b markers stay the same using this test feno wage increases by .9 years for every year of chronological year that that passes in other words starting in 2020 i should expect to see an average pheno ag in 2024 of 39.2 years so .9 multiplied by 4 years and then adding that to 35.6 in contrast i've avoided an age related biological age increase which suggests that i've improved these biomarkers resisting age related changes over the past four plus years all right so rather than just looking at data entered into a spreadsheet let's let's take a look at the full blood test report and that's what we'll see here this is page one of the report now note that i don't go to my doctor to get these data or to order the test i go to altalab test.com where i pick the test that i want i then bring that form to quest diagnostics which does the blood draw and then i get the results relatively quickly so i tested on a friday morning and i had these results within one day or the next day uh on saturday if you want to uh support the channel while testing yourself there's an affiliate link link in the video's description all right so some highlights and then room for improvement so one highlight is hdl at 63 which is pretty close to the optimal range of 50 to 60 for men and if you miss that video i'll link to it in the right corner so besides just being close to the optimal range for hdl it's also now the 12th test in a row where hdl is greater than or equal to 50 mg per deciliter and that's important because for the previous 43 tests since 2015 my average hdl was about uh 10 11 or 10 to 11 milligram per deciliter lower at 44.7 so i've been able to consistently keep hdl relatively higher and closer to that optimal range over the past around 2 years triglycerides improved test over test from 60s and 70s for the past couple of tests to 57 and values around 40 or less is associated with lowest risk for coronary heart disease mortality so the goal is to get it to 40 or less so 57 is on the right track hscp at2 mg per liter this is now 20 tests in a row where my hscp is less than the lab's limit of detection less than3 mg per liter or less than or equal to3 mg per liter and then also glucose at 90 which increased from 87 over the past test but note that my 53 test average glucose since 2015 is 89.6 milligram per deciliter so 90 is right there it's essentially my average over the past uh nine years so that's good news on to page two creatinine at 098 is not my lowest in 2024 i had values of 082 and lower is better it suggests better kidney function and on the other side though this is close to my average since 2015 as creatinine average is 0.95 now if 082 was significantly better than 098 or 098 got significantly worse in terms of kidney function i'd expect to see increases for biomarkers such such as blood ua nitrogen and uric acid which increase in the presence of suboptimal kidney function so in my case blood ua nitrogen is actually towards the lower end of my range at 9 milligrams per deciliter is relatively low too so that didn't increase and uric acid you can see that the lab flagged it as low so that's not high either or relatively higher so the 098 for creatinine even though that's on the high side relative to my average and the last couple tests in 2024 the other biomarkers suggest that kidney function is is is not adversely affected and in terms of uric acid or in terms of the lab flagging uric uric acid as low i covered that in the last video in this series blood test number six and if you missed that i'll link to that in the right corner so some other highlights albumin at 5.0 once again youthful and then liver enzymes so a and alt i've had some issues with them being in the mid 20s which is a bit high because as and alt have a u-shaped associations with all cause mortality risk so too low low can be increased risk too high can be increased risk with optimal being around the bottom of the u somewhere in the high teens to low 20s so that's now true for a but it's not true for alt 15 would be increased risk relative to values in the high teens low 20s now a better marker of kidney health and function may be ggt and in an earlier blood test it was relatively low which suggests that al and a that we see here may not be that big of a deal but to confirm i likely include ggt at future test as it's easier to interpret it's uh lower is better and as it increases it's linearly linearly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk i'm also tracking thyroid hormones so you can see free t4 and free t3 freet t3 is the active form of thyroid hormone and unfortunately the conversion of 3 t4 into 3 t3 declines during aging so i'm tracking that ratio now for this test these results are my lowest ratio over five tests that i've measured it in 2024 so i'll go to the correlations which i post on patreon at following every blood test to see what i can do to improve the free t3 to free t4 ratio in my data all right the mcv at 93.5 came down from the last test by a small amount 94.7 and that may be in part because i followed a correlation with cocoa bean intake relatively higher intake is significantly correlated with a lower mcv in my data now i can't say if that's causation that there may be many factors but i'd like to get my mcv lower to the lower end of my range as it increases during aging and relatively higher values are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so as of right now mcv is a weak spot that i'm looking to improve on the other side though the the rdw is a youthful 12 12 and that's one reason for my relatively young feno age as it's a major driver of that biological age test or that the calculation involved in that biological age test also note lymphocytes so i've had or i had three tests with lymphocytes less than 1,600 in 2024 this is now the second test in a row where they're close to 1,900 and note that optimal is around 2,000 lymphocytes decline during aging so having three tests less than 1600 is going in the wrong direction whereas for the past two tests including this test it's moving closer to that optimal of around 2,000 and then dhea sulfate at 126 might be a bit low and i'm not sure about that so andr androgens declined during aging and in my data i have a couple of data points from about 15 years ago where they were at 300 but i was also experimenting with supplementing with dhea so i don't know and i wasn't i was far from as rigorous as i am now at tracking everything that i that i take in so i don't know if that 300 was because i was supplementing with dhea or that was my natural youthful level if it was my natural youthful level the goal is to get it back from 126 to 300 uh and first without without using dha i want to see if i can re rejuvenate my my body's ability to get me back there on the other side i want to resist any age related decline knowing that androgens include including dhea sulfate declin during aging so with that in mind 126 is almost identical to my 17 test dhea sulfate average over the past 26 months so i've been able to resist an age- related decline over the past two plus years all right so what might be contributing to these data what diet and supplements correspond to a 15year younger by biological age and i'll cover that in the next video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more
