# @everythingepigenetics Podcast: Dr. Michael Lustgarten

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Welcome to the everything epigenetics podcast where we discuss dna regulation in the insights it can tell you about your health i'm hannah went and i'm the founder of everything epigenetics today my guest is michael lart this is a really great episode for anyone who is interested in biohacking their own health michael's goal is to live longer than everyone that has ever lived and his brand goes by the saying conquer aging or die try we talk about his history what led him to this goal how he defines aging and if he considers it a disease we also talk about how he optimizes his diet physical activity sleep and body weight and how that actually affects all of these biomarkers that he's measuring we talk about his dna epigenetic methylation results which include measurements of the horvath hanam denen paast and chamir lang test we also chat about what he prioritizes what he's not measuring and how he uses a methodology where he only changes specific variables at a time a little bit of background into michael like i mentioned his long-standing goal is to live longer than anyone that's ever lived on this earth he actually plans on using the best available science to biohack his way to super longevity and he makes videos about this and other anti-aging related topics on his youtube and on patreon you'll actually get more exclusive information that he doesn't post on any other social media platforms including daily updates for fitness metrics like rhr hrv sleep data and diet including food amounts in nutrient content you'll also find early looks at videos in progress including the papers that he references in different slide to slide setups and updates michael lesar is a scientist on the nutrition exercise physiology and sarcopenia team at the hnrca and his research currently focuses on the role of the gut microbiome in serum from metabolome on muscle mass and function in older adults michael has been a guest lecture at the fredin school of nutrition science and policy on topics such as the gut microbiome serum metabolome oxidative stress exercise and sarcopenia he has contributed to over 31 publications in leading peer review journals that have been cited more than 4,000 times including 17 manuscripts as the first or last author now for my guest michael lgarden welcome to the everything epigenetics podcast michael i'm excited for you to be here today thanks for joining hi hannah i know we were just chatting offline i feel like you're my closer friend or colleague or whatnot i know we've been chatting back and forth via emo probably for a couple years now which seems crazy to say but this is the first time we're actually talking you know i guess face to face camera to camera so really excited just to learn more about you and really your biohacking over the years how epigenetics has played a role in that so we'll get right into it and would just love for you to introduce yourself to really me my guest i know you have your phd from the university of texas health science center at san antonio so go ahead and take it away yeah so hey everyone my name is michael l garden uh in my day job i'm a scientist at the tus human nutrition research center on aging and then in my uh side job for uh you know both of these roads are a passion obviously but in my side job uh as thomas anderson well as neo well i don't know that sounds weird but my goal is to live longer than anyone that's ever lived so in my side job i've been quote unquote biohacking trying to optimize my blood biomarkers blood pressure oral microbiome you name it for probably the last eight plus years so um yeah so that's i guess what we're going to dive dive deep into more people care about that than my actual day job as a scientist which is really interesting so well i'm i'm going to pick at that a little bit i'm curious when did you i guess start getting interested in more of like the biohacking space you said it's been around eight years but it's really hard to juggle to separate positions i i feel that way sometimes with everything epigenetics because you know i don't really work on this in my nine to5 unless i'm actually physically recording and i'm doing editing and everything outside so how did you start to balance that or realize that hey i'm really passionate about this this is something i want to spend more time on yeah so this has been a journey it's been an evolution for a long time it actually goes back way past eight years so i started probably 2008 so 15 years where once a year i had the idea all right every time i go to the doctor i'm gonna record everything in a spreadsheet and i'm just going to track it over time and i didn't understand that you know the uh reference range is probably not what's optimal for health and longevity it's just a populationbased average you're either too low or too high i didn't get that like i was the probably like most people where it was you know hey i just got my blood test back and you know my data is right in the middle of the range so i'm good so back in 2008 i had that mentality it was only testing like once a year but i thought it was better than nothing right so um then sometime but then the story goes back even further than that because um so i have two university degrees the first one was in english literature and i wasn't there are no scientists in my family nobody college educated in my family it wasn't exposed to any doctors or scientists so i really didn't have that as a career goal as a kid so um after my first university degree in 94 it was it was like what am i going to do with my life so i basically spent five years just roaming the united states without a clue without a passion and then i came across uh roy dr roy walford famous cali restriction scientist um who wrote a book called beyond the 120-year diet which basically detailed calorie restriction and its impact on lifespan and animal models for like 50 years so also in that book he had um he had biomarker data because people who were in the biosphere experiment where they were self-enclosed and they were growing their own food trying to replicate what it would be like to live on mars they were they were studying blood biomarkers over that 2-year period and improved a whole bunch of blood biomarkers so that was in his book too i was like wow that's really fascinating blood biomarkers and aging and you know living past 120 i'm in yeah so then i made so my because my first degree was in english lit i had to go back to school uh because i didn't have many science courses i had astronomy one and two and physics one and two but i didn't have biochem so i had to go back to school for biochem uh you know to to pursue this as a career so anyway so i did that and then uh picked an aging you know related lab uh for my graduate work and then yeah so anyway in 2008 uh that's when that's when the whole bicking as a side project uh started with probably the goal of it maybe being a full-time thing seeing people like seam lan do it and uh brian johnson doing it full-time so there is there is yeah well that that's awesome that and you know we'll talk about your platform your youtube channel and how informative your videos are but the way you present the information now it makes sense that you have that english background because you do such a great job at explaining what i think can be very complicated you know mechanism of actions and the biochemical based pathways so i really like how you break it down so i can see where that english degree comes from but you have to be pretty brave to go back to school for biochemistry as well yeah so a couple a couple things there one is i have very strong idiot genetics and what i mean what i mean by that is like in the class you there you have when you don't know something you have a choice if you stay quiet then now you're for sure on the idiot track whereas if you ask now you're evolving out of that so yes uh so i know what it feels like to feel like poorly educated so because it's a big part of me like it's funny because when i was younger i used to just goof off a lot and people didn't really see me academically like my friends at the time would like just see me goofing off and they would think wow you're just an idiot and i'd be like you don't you don't get it there's a whole other side of me so so knowing that i i i i h i know what it feels like to not understand something i try to make it as easy to understand as possible but i still get people saying like this is too dense for me you know uh but i'm trying to make it as easily you know easily distilled as possible and then there was something else you said that i was going to go on but i forgot going back to school maybe yeah so when i went back to school like i i when i went back for b kem i i wasn't messing around i didn't go i i didn't didn't do anything aside from study exercise and that's it because um i knew that i was going to get some push back like like kind of like you mentioned like it's a you know why are you going back to school how do we know you're not going to flake out so one of the um faculty members who interviewed me basically brought that up and said look you've been out of school for five years how do we know you're not just going to flake and just do something else and i told them i was like look you don't i got almost straight a's in biokem like when people were getting 55s in organic hem and that was a c based on the curve i was getting a you know 90s and then saying how come i'm not getting an a why are you giving me an a minus the class average is 55 so so uh but i basically said that look you don't go back to school and get almost straight a in b kim i at that time i was all in i was fully committed you know so i saw i saw basically where i am now for like 20 years earlier and i i kind of mapped it out you know how do i get to that road so we have to be proud of that congratulations i mean looking back you know i know you're a person who hey i i still have a ways to go or what not but even just kind of laying that out and talking about those accomplishments that's that's great and yeah you know we got kind of the story of how you went back to school and and where you're interest actually peaked in some of these this biomarker based tracking and you have that goal to live longer than everyone that's ever lived and now you have this organization conquer aging or die trying so when did conquer aging or die trying actually become a real organization yeah uh i don't know how real of an organization it is it's just motto it's just motto my motto of the channel and i mean every every word of it you know so um at some point i you know the channel name was just my name and then i was like i need something catchy you know yeah so you know because so many people online have these just you know soand so health maximalist or you know so and so wants you to live and that's their handle so i was like all right let's put it down conquer aging or die trying you know well it's super catchy i really like that as well and of course you know with our rejuvenation olympics i think it's like it's the same exact saying but saying it different ways the race you never want to win or whatnot right but i think yours is a little bit um easier understood and upfront so i really like that but it could it could turn some people off because you know it's uh hearing the or die trying i think can trigger some people where they're just like i don't want it's just too crazy for me but it is what it is you know so yeah you have to be all in right and i know you're central premise as well is that hey if we have these wellestablished biomarkers not only have them but if we're actually using them and we're able to track them of different organ system systemic health other again mechanism of of actions going back into those biochemical pathways and using probably what you learned when you went back to school you know can aging and disease risk be slowed so that's kind of the question that you're answering and just to ponder on that you know what do you how would you define aging yourself and maybe talk about if you would consider as a disease as well yeah so uh it it's just the just the simple definition it's the progressive deterioration with organ and systemic function over time right so and then in terms of of it being a disease or not so i actually wrote a paper a few years ago uh you know so somebody published the paper uh trying to classify aging as disease and then at that time my academic work was leading me towards the gut microbiome and a potential influence on muscle like gut muscle axis so i started doing a deep dive into the impact of just all of the microbiome mouth skin you know gut everywhere um and published the paper you know saying hey if aging is classified as a disease don't forget about the microbes and that was before that uh you know the microbiome was even considered as one of the hallmarks of aging which in the latest update it is so um is it a disease um i don't know this gets into semantics and like when people debate debate that stuff online i i kind of run away from it because yeah you know they're they're the types who want to just debate semantics all day and then there are the types like me who just like i want to get in and actually try to do something about it so i think it is a disease you know yeah we didn't evolve you know humans haven't haven't lived long enough to evolve the genetic to basically of immortality i guess that's the easiest way to put it and but fortunately we've got the you know the the brain capacity to develop tools to uh to overcome that right but it's just a question of can you can you overcome the genetics of not having immortality cated in your genome you know can you use you know the human brain capacity to get around that within a 70-year time span to push human longevity forward whereas the genetics won't do it for who knows how long right so yeah yeah well i agree with you for for what it's worth yes not going to get caught up on the semantics and what it means if aging define as a disease for society or grants or or whatnot but i really do i think everything else these diseases we see typees to diabetes me metabolic uh disease even things like kidney liver or different organ system diseases and even cancer you know if we attack aging headon first it actually mitigates those diseases too so hey let's take a step back figure out step one which is aging and then slow those progression of those diseases as well so um even if you've got the healthiest lifestyle just like you said aging is underlying all all of these diseases so maybe i'll delay it for 50 years right i won't get it i won't get type two diabetes at some age it'll just be some later age like i'm sure you know centenarians have delayed onset of diseases by like 20 or 30 years right so yeah um so it's coming for everyone no no matter what right right so for sure the the you know the foundation foundation roots of aging to actually study and optimize yeah for sure but there is another central premise of my channel besides track and optimize and it's basically self-empowerment like we don't have to wait for rcts and other people we don't have to wait for animal studies that may or may not translate into human longevity we can test ourselves and often you know um i think most take most people take that for granted like so many people are taking supplements and they never actually see like is this a net benefit neutral or detrimental to my actual health so that that's probably you know the third rung of the uh premise essential premise like track test and track you know don't take something based on hope what is the data what is your own data say so exactly and and i i talk about that day in and day out i feel like now there was a key word there that i really liked you said which was you kind of corrected yourself you said track your data track your own data right and i think that's really important and we'll get into exactly what you've been doing which is is great and a amazing proof of concept but even with the epigenetic dna methylation testing a lot of people see oh well there's this clinical trial and there's still very few clinical trials as we know right it's it's very new technology and they'll go to something based on that clinical trial and i'll say well wait a second sure you can use that as a guide but we still don't even know if that works for you so every single clinical trial is still going to be biased in the sense that they're testing a very specific population and you have your own biological makeup yep so i really do encourage people to track all sorts of biomarkers epigenetics not being the only part of the picture just gave that example because of course my platform and what we're talking about today so you know um what i want to know now michael is what are you doing tell me tell me what you're tracking you you know i see age biomarkers i see um all sorts of other biomarker testing but tell me a little bit about what you're doing yeah so i started with the standard chanel um the cbc and uh so i started with that which is a $35 test and most people it's probably the most underrated thing that can be done to quote unquote optimize health because it includes not just glucose and lipids you know metabolic health it's got markers of kidney and liver function immune cells red blood cells i mean all things that changed during aging so um i started with that so i've got basically a quote unquote big picture panel of about 20 to 25 biomarkers that cover all of those organ systems uh and then i added once morgan line published her or dr morgan line published her you know i get so casual everybody to me is just you know the name without the the you know anyway so without the authority part um so then when she published her fena wage i added in high sensitivity c reactor protein but even that i mean they're like i'm sure you know there you know there's like a immune age and it's like a whole panel of immune biomarkers but biomarkers that aren't commercially available though i mean i' i'd happily measure all that too but i so hscrp and then you know it's funny because like epigenetics is not my background it's not my forte like my forte was on this you know all all the basics the standard chemp panel cbc and then uh ryan was gracious enough to ryan smith for those who don't know was gracious enough to say uh hey if you want some epigenetic kits you know i'll send them to you no problem and i i i was like okay but i didn't didn't think anything of it and then they just sat in my you know my apartment for a couple months and i was trying to because you've got to know what you want to measure you've got to understand and epigenetics was so new that i really did and then as i started doing deep dives i was like oh i see i get it i get it now right so yeah so then i i added that in and you guys do tiir testing too so that's a part of the approach um so but then i've expanded it even further to oral microbiome because i've had issues with oral health my whole life probably most of it self-imposed because you i wasn't uh i grew up on a junk food diet i didn't floss um so i've i've optimized that as much as i can now but it it's it's a similar approach to what you see brian doing and uh brian johnson who's popularized it you know um which is basically trying to optimize every organ system that exists and um you know and you know just going back to back to that central premise if you if you know what it looks like in a youthful state at least in terms of biomarkers you can potentially slow it disease maximizing longevity and then hopefully living long enough to live forever if that's within the next 70 years or so absolutely yeah and you know i'm i don't know if i would would consider myself a quote unquote biohacker whatever you' like to call it there's a lot of different terms out there and i know some people don't like the word biohacker um but obviously i care very much about my health i'm i'm tracking it i'm using some of those actual biomarkers to get a baseline do certain n ofone experimentation and then track afterwards as well to see if it's hopefully a positive change maybe a negative change um in terms of what i do i don't think i've ever talked about this before but i have a longevity healthare provider i get my labs done all my hormones everything done probably includes that cbc panel that you mentioned um about every six months i've been a little bit bad and i've waited too long this time but i'm going in the next two weeks over to quest you know fasted in the morning get it over with um so i'm happy to to track those even um and get kind of my values and see my deficient in magnesium take more vitamin d or or maybe certain hormones as well so i think people don't realize how simple it can be too like you mentioned that $ 3550 range somewhere in there for the for the basics yeah so i wish i had been as rigorous earlier like if i could go back and so instead of you know kind of blazing the trail and not knowing what i'm doing and only tracking once a year i wish i was doing it you know seven times a year now but in my 20s and the reason i say that is like i when i see like it's funny because sometimes i'll see someone in their 80s and i'll be like what do they look like when they were young and you know even even like for someone who looks relatively young in their 50s you can still see that there's some and even relatively fit people you can whether it's face structure or maybe it's hormones so and even for myself i mean hair not you know withstanding you know granted shave not not alopecia but um anyway so what i'm trying to get at i think hormones maybe the you know um androgens and estrogen respectively for men and women i i didn't track that at all for a very very long time but i wonder if keeping them at optimal levels from youth 50s and beyond like would retain some of that youthful look at advanced age um because you could have it's i think it's relatively easy to have optimal markers of kidney and liver and immune cells i think that's relatively easy but i don't know that that drives the youth the quote unquote youthful look as much yeah that's that's an interesting take and it'd be great to have that data of course at true diagnostic we usually test people between their 40s and 60s just because that's who our healthcare providers are seeing right and we always encourage people to do this testing in your 20s or 30s just to again get that data profile that um information about oneself set up now i will say the one recommendation we make to those healthcare providers and the one thing that's been proven uh in an interventional trial is just hormone replacement therapy in um women uh who have gone through menopause but again delaying the onset of menopause can have some really great aging effects as well i will say that most of the patients that we treat are probably on some type of hormone replacement therapy and we have a very very healthy population so i do think there's probably some correlation there i don't want to say definitively because it's very very subjective is what i'm saying but we can run a massive analysis and again see which uh products are better correlated with of course better aging or even like age at at onset of menopause like i'm i'm i'm betting that the women who had the you know most delayed onset of menopause probably have like the youngest either horvath or the and pace you know and then i wonder how that translates if they're able to keep it up you know for longevity right so yeah yeah definitively and and we i think we'll learn more about that as as time goes on as well um it's it's weird to me i i um have had someone ask me this question i'm curious to see what you think so of course we know men age quicker than women right and they die younger compared to women because of that sex paradox um so this is kind of the the topic we were talking about yet we know pregnancy really really advances uh women's age and we go through menopause right so why do you think that men still age quicker and die younger when women are going through these really drastic hormonal based changes and still live longer and still live longer purely speculation that obviously you know wasn't on our little agenda or talking points here just kind of going with this conversation do you have any thoughts about that i don't so what do you got not much just that um you know there have been a couple papers by jesse pogan out of um uh harvard uh under vadim gladish chev's lab who did look at different stressors and how biological age is affected and pregnancy is one of those stressors but it can be corrected once the stressor is gone it can be restored essentially the biological age um past even baseline if they're doing things that can better their health health um but yeah i i still don't know i i think that still doesn't account for like the physiological i guess part of pregnancy that we go through right in the healing of the body so i don't know just wondered if you had any other snippets now that i'm thinking about it more just the plate devil's advocate maybe maybe uh men are more likely to have a poor diet and smoke i i don't know that this is the case but uh but then i'm thinking animal studies you know even then do female mice live longer than male mice on a calorie restricted diet or any intervention sometimes some interventions are sex specific but i don't know that like female animal models would necessarily live longer i guess it depends on the intervention but it's a tough human study to do my first thought is just women are women have evolved for longevity and the you know the men are more disposable i guess right so yeah no i i forgot it it was like a curveball and um yeah we really did asked some colleagues and didn't really get anywhere um had a couple thoughts like like you and i are having right now but if anyone listening wants to you know drop a comment or or talk about this and maybe give us some reasons that'd be great um so to follow up so i only mentioned the the blood testing side of it right so the other side of that is i'm not just testing se up to seven times a year it's uh i'm tracking you know diet fitness metrics sleep and then i've looked i so i basically uh have tracked so that hardcore approach of tracking almost literally literally everything the food goes back to 2015 so that's eight years the fitness metrics is about five years and uh so for every blood test i have an average dietary intake that corresponds to that blood test so if you test on day one and you test on day 60 for the 59 day period in between you have an average dietary intake and you can line that up with every with every blood test so i've been doing that since 2015 and and based on how so after every test i've been calculating cor ations and then you know so most people have the idea like just in standard academic studies you have two groups and you give one group an intervention and the goal is to only change literally one thing or in an animal model right but that's almost completely impossible in human studies so and even for someone like me who's highly motivated who tracks their diet who weighs all my food um you know there'll still be little things that'll be off whether it's a vitamin or mineral whatever it may be but so what i'm trying to say is after each test i c recalculate the correlations and then i modify my diet to try to push the net effect of biomarkers in in a given direction so you know it's easy to say all right i want to optimize glucose and lipids and forget about completely everything else for me it's when i'm optimizing uh glucose or lipids it's how does that look like how does that intervention look like in the in the net effect of all the other biomarkers so if it makes glucose lower but makes seven other biomarkers worse that's not going to that's not and that for just as an example like total fat you know um for me for whatever reason a very high fat diet which is when i go above about 40% more blood biomarkers start going in the wrong direction than right so using that approach i've been able to find the fat amount find the protein amount find the vitamin and mineral amounts that are you know associated with uh the most most youthful biomarker profile and i hate to say it but that's kind of the reason why it's only a matter of time before i'm at the top of that rejuvenation leader board and everybody's looking at me trying to because it's completely objective it's not like i take a 100 i don't take 100 supplements nowhere close not to put anybody on blast we know who i'm talking about but i'm a big fan of him i'm not trying to put on blast but um eventually everyone's got to come around to this approach and track literally everything and then look at you know how does this impact that within the full context so um yeah i mean that's phenomenal i mean we need a calculator from you right we need your kind of uh the your type of approach there the weakness though is just going back to that um you know one change at a time one intervention at a time so you know for a given panel of biomarkers i may have you know 20 things in my diet that send the net effect positive and 20 things that send the net effect negative right so i'm not following one thing i'm not following the top thing or the bottom thing you know i'm trying to literally follow them all so in other words if my my correlative score for protein is neg5 i eat below my average intake and that would be expected to have a better effect on biomarkers than if i went higher for protein so okay by so the i have scores for every macro and micronutrient and even for individual foods correlative scores with the blood biomarkers so i try to follow literally them all so it's for me and in working with clients i see that is the best approach because you know uh it isn't one thing you know it's just like genetics where it's to say that one gene even though sometimes one gene can affect you know a whole organism but you know when it comes to longevity it's probably going to be thousands of genes working together if not more so i kind of try to have the same approach all right i'm going to follow all of the positive correlations and follow all you know minimize the foods that are all of the negatives without knowing which one or which group is actually doing it and i'm probably losing some information using that approach but if i was going to take the truly academic approach of this one at a time thing it would take me years just to figure out and who has that time right so i mean literally who has that time right yeah you're gonna be dead die trying right so um no i i still think that's a wonderful approach and again there's going to be some pros and cons with each approach that one's going to take a long time again we don't have the time we have to do what we can with what we have right now so that's that's just amazing i mean it's so hard to change one thing before and after but i encourage people i mean i spend most of my time every single day monday through friday even on the weekend speaking with healthare providers and saying hey i know you have your emr or your certain tracking system but really track everything and it's just so hard i mean they're you know prescribing all sorts of different things at the same time and i'm saying wait a second maybe you're taking way too much maybe you're not at some metabolic homeostatic level and you know we're not able to actually know what's being affected so slow down maybe take some things away i do have an app uh just called way of life where i'm tracking like three little daily habits and i think i meditate you know every day before i go to bed i think i do these things and then i actually track it and i'm like oh crap oh my gosh i haven't meditated in three weeks right or whatnot so when you actually see it too that's at least helped me and and it's more about that that habit building and that repeatability yeah definitely just along the lines of uh you know trying to get uh doctors uh to track like or the medicines for their patients or whatever it may be in the context of a patient's health record so you know statins as you know for lowering uh total cholesterol right so i've worked with people who their cholesterol levels on statins will be very low what you would expect but then other things in the you know like whether it's kidney function markers or liver uh markers will be elevated and so i've gone into the published literature to see all can you know can statins impact these things sure enough there is evidence that stat can negatively affect the liver and negative negatively affect the kidney even muscle to release creatinine into the blood to make it look like a kidney function problem when it could be muscle damag so i wonder how much medicine is actually considering the full context rather than all right you've got high cholesterol we we're to going to give you a statin but we're not going to even measure or look at the other stuff and if the other stuff is even in the high end of the range we don't care because we want to bring your cholesterol down which is i mean it's a terrible approach right so it yeah it's pretty insane just side note on that real quick i'm going to give a shout out to my grandfather actually um he was on a a stat and then started to get yeah some you know muscle atrophy and and some issues and and whatnot so it was so funny to watch him because he does not have a science background but to go down this path and he started googling and he started saying why is this happening to me and you know was asking me all of these questions about his health so i just thought that was super interesting and um funny that you bring that up anyways there's actually one epigenetic methylation marker where if you take a statin it's the abcg1 gene that gene is actually shut off and your type two um diabetes risk skyrockets so if that gene is shut off you're affecting your insulin sensitivity and we see people who take satins have that increase in type two diabetes because that gene is shut off so that's we you get more into the crazy pharmacoepigenetic world in space that'll be its own field in probably the next decade or so but we're starting to find more and more of those correlations and connections as we do deeper l literature dry uh diet just like you mentioned then it becomes like a a modulation of risk kind of thing right because if you actually have you know cardiovascular disease and a aosc orotic plaque then it's obviously the most imperative to reduce your lipid levels because that that's like gold standard i mean you know cbd right but then you know it's if you don't die from heart disease but now you're increasing like you said type two diabetes risk and and whatever else may come with that you know how does that what's that trade-off right you don't die from cvd but now you end up with liver liver cancer right so yeah it's hard so um michael going back to what you're doing a little bit you know i i heard you say uh that you're like measuring your food and you're doing all of these things so with i think too we don't have to get into the specifics of your biomarkers if anyone wants to look into that please please please watch his videos they're absolutely great but um give me your secret sauce tell me what you're doing from you know let's get into diet physical activity sleep body weight and then i would like to talk about those epigenetic meths markers and just where you see your aging going and what actually triggers those too yeah so in terms of diet just to keep it uh easy breezy it the profile that makes my quote unquote biomarkers look the best for now or that's associated with the best profile is about and this includes uh um so fiber is converted into short chain fatty acids so fiber can be considered uh fat you can add that to the fat category so total fats about 40% total carbs or net carbs about 40% and then uh proteins uh about 18% uh so and again i didn't start i didn't haven't settled on that just based on the epidemiological studies that's following the you know uh correlations of biomarkers so body weight i've been trying to get as lean as possible for a very long time i grew up at you know looking at bodybuilding magazines and always trying to be lean and ripped um thinking how could you ever die you know if you're if you're highly lean and highly functional so um i'm slowly trying to get towards 6% i'm probably at about 8 or 9% now um which was higher in the past so about 12% and that may actually be what's driving my d and pace because as you know uh it's the only epigenetic clock in that head-to-head matchup of uh five other epigenetic clocks that showed a epigenetic age reduction right for people on cr for two years so my donan pace has actually been coming down since i started um sequentially almost every test and the only thing that's i haven't made major changes to my diet but i've been purposely reducing my body weight and my body fat percentage over that time so that may be the the the factor that's driving it the most and in support of that you know uh people like seam land and brian johnson who have relatively low scores they're also very lean compared to the average population so i don't know that would be my hypothesis for that i track fitness metrics which helped me um titrate how much exercise how often um even which days i should be training versus not um i see the treadmill in the background too so you have to be doing some some cardio there well for for cardio it it's i haven't done the treadmill so much these days that i do mostly low intensity cardio but this the core of my workouts is an 80-minute workout with uh compound movements you know overhead press pull-ups some deadlifts if if my i have a herniated disc in my lower back from eagle lifting as a kid which you know so i have to be very careful there but um compound movements calisthenic some taekwondo related stuff uh some mobility balance and flexibility all you know so the goal is to be you know so there's also a gate that's associated with uh age right if you look at someone's gate and how they move and even how they're able to move you can see that someone looks old just based on their movement pattern so yeah my workouts are tailored so that i don't or i minimize that as much as possible i don't want to ever look at me and someone's like why you move like an old person right so um so yeah it's like an 80 minute when i started tracking the fitness uh stuff heart rate variability resting heart rate uh i was chronically overtrained i mean i was doing workouts that were way too long these cardiovascular fitness metrics look like someone who was a sedentary which was ridiculous i was walking 15 to 20 miles a week doing three-hour weightlifting workouts once or twice a week i mean i was highly trained so you the fitness metrics to me are essential for uh knowing when to train how much to train how often uh but that even that too was a big a bit of an ego hit because uh yeah i mean i've said it before i like throwing heavy weights around like a gorilla for three hours you know it's what it's i love the challenge but it it's just murder for me in terms of uh my recovery is too slow i feel terrible for a week uh so ret tracking that with whoop or wearable or something like that whoop using whoop but any fit any any wearable i think i think most of them most of them are pretty good where they they give that basic information heart rate varability resting heart rate the average daily heart rate which even knowing it took me a while to figure that out too so um if if it's a workout day my my heart rate for that day would be relatively high and it took took me a while to figure out that i do best in terms of quote unquote recovery for the next workout uh in terms of performance and during that workout if my heart rate the next couple days is purposefully lower now if i wasn't tracking that it's very easy for me or you know i don't know other people but it's very easy for me if my heart rate on that day is is 58 beats per minute on a workout it may be 60 62 and then now i'm not recovering as fast because i'm still chronically stressing myself so seeing the data has really helped me hone it in such that this morning's data it was uh 8141 for heart rate variability resting heart rate i mean that's like almost endurance athletes that are you know elite cyclists it's like 140 and i'm not nowhere near that you know so that i can kind of quotequote biohack my way towards that direction i don't know for me impressive yeah but yeah no that's that's great to hear and and again people are just like what do i do what do i do someone show me the data and first and foremost you need to start tracking these things yourself but um i think we actually see that a lot in more of those horvath related epigenetic age clocks those first generation kind of chronological age ones um again getting closer to chronological age but still trying to measure an epigenetic methylation process and we see in people who are more of the elite athletes or you know olympians that they actually have those faster more intrinsic or horvath related epigenetic ages so i think that's really interesting i think you know kristen mcgrey has a has an interesting algorithm called d methylation fit age um true diagnostic is getting ready to release a version of that soon based on our omic age data set that we've done and that's going to give you your fitness your your biological age based on your fitness levels too so i'd be curious to see how that tracks because we're going to do v2 max f1 g strength and gate speed as well wait wait so you were saying that people who are more active would have older horvath ages or i interpreted that wrong yeah yeah usually we see that trend yeah so people come back and uh it's funny to speak with like their these healthcare providers who oh hey this person was you know an elite psychist or just uh just ran just performed in a triathlon or or whatnot and trained this much and i and why do they have these really bad intrinsic epigenetic ages and well we believe it's due to some or some obvious compounded oxidative stress that may lead to inflammation that may lead to a cascading negative fall of events and and affect those epigenetic methylation patterns so it's just ever so slightly we want to see more of a variety of movements i like to call it rather than you know working exercise uh so so walk lift weights you know good rule with them lift weights at least a couple times a week right as we age we lose that muscle mass um do the do the taekwon do different things like you were saying as well because again your body's not getting used to this one movement you're not putting as much stress on it so what you're saying this is why i like speaking with you what you're saying from the biomarker perspective in all of these wearables is literally matching the data that i know from an epigenetic space nice that that elite athletes or that athletes would have older horvath ages i mean it it could be just overtraining i mean it's maybe it's not the oh yeah correct yeah but it's just funny that you know all of my other so my horvath age right now is right at my chronological age but if i wanted to spin that a different way it's been as high as like 56 so it's like technically i could say over the last three or four tests i've reduced it from 56 to 50 but i don't know that i would yeah make that you know exaggerated claim but um yeah anyway no absolutely that's that's great so um no you went over diet the physical activity um what about your sleep are you're tracking that with the who well yeah yeah yeah sleep sleep is probably the hardest one to track or not track but to optimize and you know so there there are some bas so i should preface by saying my sleep has always been bad going back to maybe teenage years um or sleep quality and duration not been great now sleep hygiene is a real thing maybe i didn't believe it at some point in the past but i believe it now and i've been in that boat of go to sleep at the same time i bought some stuff to black out out most of my uh windows so that i don't get residual light coming in because i'm right on the street in boston so like even though my shade is pull closed if the if the wind blows the shade a little bit i can get a ray of light and i've been awakened by a ray of light hitting my eyes while i'm asleep which is crazy so uh so going i i literally go to sleep at the same time every night i black out the room as much as possible sleep with the earplugs to because it's busy you know and i it wakes me up in the middle of the night if i don't but and then uh i also uh i my my eating window is relatively short and it doesn't necessarily impact my blood biomarkers but stopping the eating window as early as possible for me on a uh at home workday it's around uh 1:00 almost all of my calories on a uh in-person workday it's a little bit later maybe 3 o'clock so my bedtime is around 9 so i've got about a six-h hour window at least where there's no food very little water um so the majority of it is earlier in the day and that uh helps because then i'm not waking up two three four times during the night which that was in the past you know that's how uh it was there were even times that i'd eat one meal a day and fast all day eat from 6:00 to 9: and i mean i was every hour i'd wake up and then the next morning i' feel awful because you know waking up every you know so often but like i said sleep for me is the hardest thing to optimize because even with all of those little tricks of the trade that have helped my sleep im immeasurably uh well i shouldn't say immeasurably but interesting um so i had a sleep study done uh 10ish 12 something years ago where i went for the gold standard uh polysomnography where you actually sleep in a you know climate control room and they gear you up with electrodes at that time only 5% of my total sleep time was in deep sleep deep sleep declines during aging so 5% is something you'd expect to see in like an 80-year old so and that was when i was in my early 30s so now whoop has been compared against uh psg and and uh you know for deep sleep it's been found to be comparable so i'm actually getting a lot more than 5% i'm actually up to 20 to 25% deep good so yeah so it can be improved um now with that said and i mentioned you know it's probably the hardest thing to optimize because how can you stay asleep when you're asleep you know falling asleep i mean it's you know you just got to get into a little meditative zone for me so but like like clockwork i'm up three to five hours after i uh go to sleep and then yeah within the last 2 or 3 hours before uh waking up it's sometimes every hour last night um maybe it was because i was like all right i got to get to into work at a certain time so i got to leave at a certain time to be back here but i was up it was like every 20 minutes from 3: to 5 which wow you're excited for this podcast for sure for sure but there you go it's just but other nights it's like that too where it's uh you know i'm up three or four times right i mean i'm up and conscious and i actually have to like tell i have to calm myself down and like literally have to meditate myself to sleep most nights i can do that but every so often it doesn't work so you know then that gets into uh you know is it a melatonin issue is it so optimizing that i'm still i'm cooking up some biochemical pathways and uh you know see what i can do nice well i'm excited to see what comes i'm gonna send you someone i like for sleep too i'll give a shout out her name is molly mlin i think she just got married it's molly eastman now if you follow her and and whatnot her content is really really good on instagram and to i think i've checked her out i don't know i think that name sounds familiar yeah yeah i'll i'll send it to you afterwards but that's interesting i'm funny enough sleep is actually the easiest thing for me probably when i wear my whoop down it's like 100 hundred 100 and then i i'll look at the metrics too to make sure i'm getting enough and rem deep sleep etc um i probably fall asleep too fast like i can fall asleep in the movie theaters type of thing if i'm tired enough um so that's something you know i probably need to work on but if i could go to bed at you know 6:00 p.m. I'd be in bed so i usually try 8:30 9 wind down put the phone away no screens you know stop eating hours ahead of time um all that good stuff so no i'm really excited to yeah to have heard about what you're doing now um do you prioritize any one of those or any biomark or would you just say sleep because that's the hardest for you right now so uh they're all important you know i don't want to put one above the other but sleep is probably the most important of of them all because if my sleep quality is bad and i'm up a few times it not only can that so there are times when i'm so wide awake at two in the morning and i try to minimize these occurrences as much as possible but i'm so wide awake and then i'm just laying there in bed for like an hour that i'll eat my breakfast at 1:00 am. And then within like an hour or a half an hour boom i'm asleep so it could be some aspect of cr that's impairing my sleep quality at that point but interesting but that kills my my data my heart rate variability resting heart rate and then knowing that i'm ready i i'll have overtrained data because i ate so late or so early i'm not training on that day so if that was a scheduled workout day and i ruined it by my poor sleep quality now i got to push that another day so uh sleep is essential you know even for me like even like a 30 to 60 minute sleep debt over a couple of days it can start to affect my mental and and you know physical performance so um absolutely yeah i know when i wake up in the middle of the night or this this has happened more recently when i'm like traveling because i'm not an anxious flyer i'm i'm fine when i'm in planes or cars are traveling but just the fact that i'm like oh i set my alarm for you know 400 a.m. To head to the airport i'm like you know up and i think anxious and just a little stressed out and i'll wake up and check you know the clock and go back to bed so it's like you kind of just start getting a little bit of a that acute stress where the wheels start turning and then you're up and you know you're thinking about all sorts of things so i can i can definitely work on that so um michael what aren't you tracking is there anything you're you're like i just i why didn't i start tracking that earlier or are you not tracking one thing um that you can think of yeah so i it was hormones i wish i i went back and tracked hormone levels earlier especially like dhea sulfate which declines during aging and i have this in a video where my levels were youthful 15 years ago and i didn't track it at all i just forgot about it it's not under standard chemp panel and then once i started tracking it last summer i have 20 plus tests now and all of them are pretty low and granted it's not reference range low but it's just low relative to my own and then relative to you know what youthful levels look like so how do you you know it's almost like if your if your organ function you know it's like it's if you're bleeding to death and you give someone you know uh uh a transfusion a blood transfusion it's hemorrhagic shock they can they can die anyway you know it's just you hit this point of no return that you can't you can give someone that's hemorrhaging blood and they're going to bleed to death anyway because they just lost they've lost so much blood so right hope that that's not the case for my adrenal glands where you know it's it's they've aged or whatever it is and it's almost like no matter what i do i can't rejuvenate them back using you know uh my standard diet and exercise or whatever else yeah um yeah so so in terms of what am i not doing i mean i i can see a road for the gut microbiome i've done it a few times it's hard not that it's hard i wouldn't say that but uh you know you just you need it's more than just who's there and then it's more than just you know in terms of so 16s is what uh you would get the species that are there if you're using or whole genome sequencing you would get the species if you use something like viome you're going to get what's the active gene expression so i would kind of need both who's there and what's the active gene expression so now i'm getting too much into the weeds you know almost the reason i say that is you know you could have changes in the gut microbiome but you'd expect to see something reflected physiologically at least in the blood right so so if i tweak various levels of of certain species in the gut and don't see any changes on you know in my uh circulating biomarkers whether it's metabolome or or uh proteins or cells sure so so i don't want to get too lost in the details of the microbiome there but that makes sense yeah i mean yeah i would agree with that as well whole whole body mri i mean that that's something that uh you know yeah i'm hearing more and more about that as well and some some like uh health optimization based groups i'm in and that the weight list is like months even um if it's i forget what the company is is called who does it if it's not just like at a healthc care provider or longevity i can dig it up and and send it to you later but yeah you know i think michael what at least to me i think everything you're doing is purely evidence-based right like you said you're looking at these biomarkers and i think that's the the take-home here is hey even if we're looking at your biomarkers could mean something different to someone else so i encourage everyone to to follow along and and really look at um michael's michael's videos and and check out his kind of profile and what he stands for so um getting more toward the end here but uh also want to know what your most surprising find was when tracking biomarkers does anything stick out so there's an idea that some biomarkers are uh they aren't malleable for example lipoprotein a which is thought to be you know you only have to test it once that's not my words that's that like you know health professionals just measure it once or once a year or whatever it is because your levels are genetically determined and they won't change so i thought that for a long time and you know back in the 2008 days when i was testing once a year i thought oh i'll never reduce this right and then i started to look at studies and try various interventions and sure enough it was pretty resistant to to change i couldn't change it but then once i started calculating those correlations with my diet i figured out all right this dietary composition cuts it in half you know i could probably get it even lower but it goes back to that you know the bottom of the u- shape where if i if i if i do the things that bring it down to you know 75% reduction other stuff other stuff goes in the wrong direction so i have to be you know comfortable with that 50% reduction from the peak while not messing up a whole bunch of other biomarkers so um i think all of the biomarkers are malleable and uh it's just a matter of figuring out your own recipe to to uh to fect them with that said you know once once i get the horvath data into the 40s people are going to be like wow you reduced it so much it's only a matter of time but i'm hot on the trail of the like i said the dhea story because even though it's been 20 plus tests if or once i'm able to reverse that trend and get it going in the right direction there's there are no rcts on uh you know usually if someone's got low dhea sulfate you're just given dhea you just take it as a supplement that's like the standard of care but you know i i part of me is arrogant as as arrogant af and i'm like look i'm gonna i'm going to show you right that whether or not i can do it whether or not i can do it maybe to be 50 tests i don't know but with enough data i think i'm gonna discover my own recipe without messing up anything else to figure out how to start pushing that back towards the right direction i actually have another video coming pretty soon on uh potentially impacting dha sulfate so yeah yeah well no i'm excited i'm i'm very very excited so um just the the list of questions i want to ask keeps growing and growing so i have one more as well do you you mentioned at the really you know very beginning of this podcast kind of how you spend your time and um that you do this a little bit on the side do you ever see it becoming a full-time job is that something you've kind of started to look at at all so the answer is yes uh okay i i do work with clients you know on the side and as much free time i have outside of making videos and academic work um yeah i you know it's a scary thing because uh one of the last things that se seam land and i talked about was you know he's completely doing it on his own and uh my channel i don't think is big enough at least from youtube the youtube side in terms of payment to sustain me on my own and i do the the client work does bring in a decent amount of revenue but you know a consistent revenue where i wouldn't have to worry about it not just it's just not yet you know but then uh that could change because um you know i see i see like morgan morg dr morgan lavine wrote a book and addie has got a book and everybody's got a book you know fontana luigi fontana there's at least one book in this whole approach you know doc progress you know even just on a uh blood biomarker quote unquote bible for what's optimal for health and longevity without my own individual data put in there is like a book right so um then all right then the question is can book sales be enough to sustain me right yeah can i get a book deal and the uh advance will sustain me for a few months long enough to write the book is that i don't even know how that process works i don't i don't even know that's possible so it's a little bit scary you know it is it's all about just you know security and again knowing kind of what's what's going to be there i think is is the hard part and it's it's hard to create content sometimes right like i'm sure maybe you you have a bigger passion for it than i do but you know i'm um with that english back ground of yours too sometimes it's i do think it takes one of the best skills is taking you know something that's a very very very complex subject and breaking it down for the lay person and again you do a really good job at that so you know maybe it's not if it becomes a full-time job but when or if you really want that to happen no i definitely do i definitely do and in terms of content i see that all over youtube too where people are you you can tell when someone's dying for some content uh it i i have no shortage of that like i i have i have so many tabs that are open that like that i'm you know the but i just don't have the time i have to you know uh it's you know i have it's limited time right but then the other side of that is if i'm out of academia some of those pap papers that i have access to how am i going to have access you know so uh there's that side of it too but there you know i'm even thinking about so the conquer aging or die trying brand doesn't just apply to health optimization there are whole other sides which maybe gets into weird fringe but um i i have visions of expanding beyond just the health stuff which could help because there's a broader interest you know there'll be people in the channel that are here for health there are people here that are here for other stuff and i don't know if i want to say it yet i don't know you you know maybe i'll get judged but i don't care it's other stuff i'm passionate about and really really cool stuff well i think as people follow you along um i mean you'll see this with a lot of like celebrities famous actors singers what not as people follow along you'll realize that it's yes sure maybe initially they got interested because of the subject but they're going to stay because they like you right and they want to know your opinion so um i think that's huge i mean uh you know you can say it with like taylor swift for example right you have these swifties and they're just like they probably don't like all of her music but they love her and that's why she's like had5 billion dollar to the country with her tour and whatnot so um you know that's kind of a a wild example but yeah i'm excited to follow along and see what you come up with because you know i'm i'm here for for you and and what you're doing but obviously became interested because of the scientific respect of that you're taking an approach it kind of goes to the idea of diversification like imagine if true diagnostic only focused on forv hanam and don face like you guys have you know like we've talked about like you've told told me and i won't say anything about what may be coming but you haven't released yet but like you guys are on that cutting edge and i know that that's cutting edge because some of the same stuff we were talking about i'm studying in my own stuff academically right soo broadening the horizon so now it attracts the wider like if you only focus on epigenetics there may be a very small window of people who are interested in that now you branch it out into these other metrics too and now you're engaging a wider audience so it's kind of it's kind of like that too like uh for ex i'll give you exactly i'll give you an example so uh and this there are going to be people who are like man you've lost it you know you're too old you're talking about crazy stuff when i no i wouldn't hear it when i see houses like you know i'm thinking about buying a house boston's crazy expensive it's ridiculous but anyway you look at these houses and they last maybe 100 years like a really good well- constructed house if you're lucky 100 years some of the houses that i've seen they're like sheds you know the a hard wind comes and it looks like it'll blow the house down right so you know if you go back far and i i can't say when these things were constructed but if you looked at like temples and i i'm not even talking about egypt but like uh in india and all these these you know uh the kind of crazy stuff that graham hancock is on about you know these megalithic structures that are carved out of the rock out of the mountain this to me is a longevity mindset like whoever did that stuff whether it was people a thousand years ago or way older than that that mindset was we're going to construct something that that exists for a very long time that's the conquer aging or die trying mindset so uh i have ideas to make start interviewing people who are who are uh looking into those kinds of things you know um i i probably sooner than later yeah and i'd be interested i'm just saying if my opinion matters at all um but no that's that's great so everyone who's listening you know check out dr michael lustgarten he has his youtube channel um and a lot of other ways that you can connect with him as well you know all these social media platforms on conquer aging or or die trying um the one question i asked everyone at the end michael is if you could be any animal in the world what would you be and why man uh so my favorite i have two favorite animals the monkey an elephant and well three octopus um okay man i don't know if i could be an animal i mean how about how about uh so technically we're all animals right i mean all of us yes it should be if you could be another animal so i mean it's all perspective right so if you take so you know michael rose you've got the fruit flies stock and you selectively allow the longer live ones to breed with each other and the shor live ones breed with each other and before you know it 2,000 generations later you've got the long live flies and shli flies but they started from the same founder stock so if i could be any animal i'd be the you know 2,000 generations from now version of whatever humanity is relative to this version of me now wow i love it no one's answered that that's a great way to put it and bring it back to your platform no that's that's awesome i love that that answer um and then about you you know where can people find you if you just want to reiterate that again yeah all over the interwebs uh conquer aging or die trying um facebook twitter instagram youtube patreon uh linkedin yes everywhere i'm everywhere i even respond i'm responding to comments everywhere too because you know unlike i don't want to put other people on blast but i'm a man of the people i'm here to serve on a you know every every video i make i'm respons the comments even seam seam lands video that we did on his channel yeah i went to his channel and he didn't respond to any of them yet i was responding to people asking questions so uh yeah i'm everywhere i'm no that's great and and i feel like i get told this and i do this but you know i respond to emails fairly quickly i think you respond to emails very quickly as well and i'm like yes um you know and you know i know you're you're busy but you really do prioritize the relationships and your your interactions with people as well so i i definitely appreciate that just real quick there there are scientists who are terrible at emails and i'm sure you know i i i'll never be like that even with like papers you know you get like a paper and you have two weeks to review it i try to review it as fast as possible because i don't want to be the person that keeps it holding it up for two weeks so somebody's got to set the good example so that's i mean i say it humbly i'm just you know trying to lead a good example so absolutely well thank you so much michael we've come to the end of this amazing podcast remember for those listening who want to connect you can out google his name and again thank you for joining us here at everything epigenetics remember you have control over your epigenetics so tune in next time to learn more thanks everyone thanks
