Is relying solely on data from published studies a sub-optimal strategy for optimal health to illustrate what i mean by that let's have a look at red blood cells in particular the reference range as defined by lab corp which is 4.14 to 5.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood so with the goal of optimizing health and longevity should red blood cells be low mid-range or high let's have a look at how red blood cells change during aging to try to answer that question so starting in youth we can see that the data for men in green and for women in blue that red blood cells decline during aging for both men and women so starting with the data from men we can see that clear decline with the green line and then for the women the data is a little bit more variable with the decline in red blood red blood cells and then an increase up until about 55 years old after which red blood cells consistently decline up until 95 years old so when considering these data this suggests that having relatively higher levels of red blood cells is youthful so with that in mind is the higher end of the reference range for red blood cells optimal for health and longevity so to try to answer that question let's have a look at my own red blood cell data since 2008 and i've blood tested 36 times over that time span so the last 13 years and from 2008 to 2013 i was measuring about once a year so uh annually at my yearly physical and i wasn't tracking my diet at all and my average red blood cell level during those six measurements was 4.96 so when then going back to the data on the left we can see that i'm higher than the than the green line which uh based based on having relatively high levels of red blood cells in youth one would expect that that should be okay or or good and then in 2015 i started tracking my diet including weighing all my food uh entering that data into chronometer and then putting all that data into an excel file so i could start so that i could start to look at correlations between my diet with these biomarkers and during that four year span from 2015 to 2019 i blood tested 17 times and my average red blood cell level during that those 17 tests was 4.62 so then when going back to the curve or actually before we go back to the curve so note that these two groups of data from 2008 to 2013 versus the 17 blood test from 2015 to 2019 are significantly different when using a two-sample t-test so now going over to the curve back on the left now we can see i'm on the aging curve which is bad news i'm not trying to be have red blood cell levels that are characteristic of my chronological age i want to have red blood cell levels that are characteristic of youth and to keep them there for as long as i as i can so because i track my diet i can make it do interventions changing various things in my diet to try to improve these biomarkers and i had success with that as we can see over the last 13 measurements from later in 2019 to my last blood test in november of 2021 we can see that my average red blood cell count is 5.1 so now going back to the curve on the left we can see that uh i'm back higher than the curve and when compared with my data from 2008 to 2013 uh the recent data 5.1 is actually significantly higher when compared with the 4.96 for my first six six six measurements and also note that from the 2015 to 2019 data those 17 blood tests when compared with my last 13 blood tests i was able to significantly increase those red blood cells when using a two sample two sample t test to evaluate statistical significance so the assumption is that having relatively high red blood cells is optimal as they decline during aging but is that true is my 5.1 value for red blood cells too high so to help answer that question evaluating correlations for red blood cells with other systemic biomarkers can help discern what's optimal so what are these systemic biomarkers which i i've referred to in recent videos as these bit the big picture biomarkers and that's what's shown here there are 23 of them usually there are 24 including red blood cells but because i'm gonna uh look for correlations between red blood cells with these biomarkers obviously red blood cells you can't correlate them with themselves so just running through this real quick as i've presented them in other videos what do these big picture biomarkers include they include glucose and homocysteine and then three markers of kidney function four markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins all of the major immune cells and platelets red blood cell related metrics like the mean corpuscular volume so the average volume in a red blood cell uh the red blood cell distribution width rdw a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c-reactive protein and then the overall biological age score as indicated by morgan levine's phenoage and the aging.ai so also note that the little n next to each biomarker is how many blood tests that i have for each each biomarker and then r is little r on the top left column is the correlation coefficient and then the p-value is the measure for evaluating statistical significance which in this case is a p-value less than 0.05 and note that this is blood test data from august of 2015 through my last blood test in november so when comparing correlations for red blood cells with all these biomarkers 11 of them have a p-value less than 0.05 so 11 significant correlations so then the next question becomes are these significant correlations going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and all-cause mortality risk and then that approach can help to identify what red blood cell amount may be optimal for me rather than relying solely on the published studies and the reference range now there are three scenarios that are possible here so if red blood cells are significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong this would suggest that red blood cells higher than my 13 year average 4.85 may be optimal conversely if red blood cells are significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right this would suggest that red blood cell levels lower than my 13 year average may be optimal and last if red blood cells are significantly correlated with the same amount of biomarkers going in the right direction as wrong this would suggest that my average my 13 year average red blood cell value may be optimal so let's see how that how that goes so let's start at the top of the list with glucose and this should be relatively straightforward and i'm going to try to go through each of these relatively quickly as i've presented this data in many other videos so glucose levels increase during aging as shown here and i'm only going to focus on the data for men as that specifically applies to me so the as you can see by the black line glucose levels increase during aging and then in terms of all-cause mortality risk which is shown there on the right we can see that relatively higher levels of glucose are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering that red blood cells higher red blood cells are correlated with higher glucose that's a significant correlation in my data that uh black arrow can be changed to a red arrow indicative of going in the wrong direction all right so next up on the list is blood urea nitrogen bun so blood urea nitrogen increases during aging as shown there by the green line and then relatively higher levels of blood urine nitrogen are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and i presented this data in my last video so if you missed that check it out so when considering those data and the positive correlation for red blood cells being significantly correlated with higher blood urination this is also going in the wrong direction so we'll put another red arrow there all right so next on the list is albumin so uh albumin levels uh for men and women decline during aging they're relatively high in youth and then decline during aging and then in terms of all-cause mortality risk we're looking at data here on the right for 85 to 99 year olds 100 to 104 year olds and older than 105. And then the hr is the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality the 95 confidence interval gives you the range where the uh risk uh risk values uh are present and what we can see is that for relatively high levels of albumin significantly lower all-cause mortality risk was identified for each of these three age groups and also interestingly note that for the other biomarkers that are in these on this on the list hdl ldl hba1c creatinine uh kidney function by egfr but using creatinine and c-reactive protein uh albumin is the only one or album the the magnitude of the uh all-cause mortality risk reduction is greatest for albumin when compared with these other biomarkers so when considering the data for albumin we can then uh and when considering that higher red blood cells are correlated with higher albumin which is going in the right direction we can change that black arrow to now a green arrow so we've got one going in the right direction for the correlation for red blood cells with albumin all right so i'm going to skip past the ast and alt and ldl for now we'll come back to that in a second uh so what about neutrophils higher red blood cells are correlated with higher neutrophils is that going the right direction or wrong so neutrophils increase during aging so the green line is the data for men and we can see that there they increase uh during aging and in terms of all-cause mortality risk that's what's shown here on the right so when starting with the referent which was two to three thousand neutrophils per microliter of blood which is where most of my data usually lies we can see that higher levels of neutrophils going from uh 3000 past 7000 neutrophils per microliter is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so we don't want to have more neutrophils uh that's as they increase during aging and are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when considering its correlation with red blood cells higher neutrophils correlated with higher red blood cells that also is going in the wrong direction so another red arrow all right monocytes have a similar story monocytes increase during aging and then when looking at the all-cause mortality data split into cardiovascular disease mortality cbd mortality and non-cardiovascular disease mortality when compared with monocytes of about 400 per microliter relatively higher monocytes are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk as shown there so this too is going in the wrong direction so another red arrow how about the percentage of lymphocytes so here in this case we see a negative correlation which means higher red blood cells are correlated with a lower percentage of lymphocytes so lymph that lymphocyte percentage declines during aging which is shown here so you can see that in youth there's a relatively higher lymphocyte percentage and then relatively lower lymphocyte percentages in advanced age now there isn't any all-cause mortality data i've yet to come across a study that looked at the percentage of lymphocytes and its association with all-cause mortality risk so if anybody's come across that data please leave a comment and and share so when considering that lymphocyte percentage of lymphocytes declines during aging this too is going in the wrong direction as higher red blood cells are correlated with lower a lower lymphocyte percentage all right so in my last video using a similar analysis of biomarkers versus biomarkers i presented these correlations for platelets showing that having relatively higher platelets within my 200 to 300 range is correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i don't want to have relatively higher levels of platelets based on that data so when considering that higher red blood cells are correlated with higher platelets that red arrow is there because it's going in the wrong direction similarly in an earlier study i used uh the same analysis to evaluate ldl and i'll link to that in the right corner if you're interested in that data but for me ldl at the lower end of my range is correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong so because of the positive correlation for red blood cells meaning higher red blood cells is correlated with higher ldl that too is going in the wrong direction so without looking at the last three biomarkers of the 11 significant biomarkers that were correlated with red blood cells mcv and then ast and alt higher red blood cells are significantly correlated with seven of the 11 biomarkers going in the wrong direction so if you remember the scenario the three scenarios this suggests that red blood cells toward the towards the high end of my range 5.1 may not be optimal now going forward i'll modify my diet and what exactly that i'll modify is will be the topic of another future video and i can't say when because i want to collect more data and uh get the data there first before presenting how i did it but going forward i'll modify my diet with the goal of reducing my red blood cells from their current about 5.1 average to within the 4.6 to 4.85 range so a little bit below my average over the past 13 years now based on the aging data for red blood cells i could have assumed that my recent red blood cell data was optimal and i would have missed that the biomarker versus other biomarker approach suggests that they're too high and i i expect that this approach can provide greater specificity for what's optimal for blood biomarkers rather than solely relying on public studies and the reference range all right if you have questions and comments uh i'm going to do something different on this channel and let's have an uh ask me anything ama so tomorrow at 12 p.m uh sunday december 12 2021. Uh if you're interested uh come to my channel and uh let's run through all this and any other questions that uh you might have if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging come join us on patreon patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
