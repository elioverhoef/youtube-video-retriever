# A High Calcium Diet Reduces Oxalate Absorption

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

There's a lot of talk about oxalates and that's because elevated plasma oxalate negatively impacts many tissues and or organs and that's what we'll see here so a high oxalate diet on its own will lead to a buildup of oxalate in the intestine which will then be absorbed into the bloodstream thereby increasing plasma oxalate elevated plasma oxalate can then negatively impact tissues including kidney function where it induces tubular toxicity obstruction and a buildup of calcium inside the kidney which is known as nephrocalcinosis in addition elevated plasma oxalate is associated with vascular calcification and poor cardiovascular health related outcomes including coronary artery disease sudden cardiac death and congestive heart failure to make matters worse elevated plasma oxalate can lead to a buildup of oxalate in tissues including bone but also the thyroid gland lung and spleen but besides dietary intake there are other ways that plasma oxalate levels can inc increase one way is with poor kidney function and note that kidney function declines during aging which would limit the ability of the kidneys to remove oxalate from the blood thereby leading to its accumulation and increasing plasma levels in addition the liver produces it and there are specific gut bacterial species that can degrade it so besides dietary intake there are other mechanisms that can impact plasma levels of oxalate for the purpose of this video i'm only going to focus on dietary intake i may focus on the other others in an upcoming video now the good news is that less oxalate is systemically absorbed when it binds to calcium and then it's just pooped out and we can see that mechanistically in this diagram so i dietary oxalate intake increases intestinal levels of oxalate as i mentioned earlier you can see the oxalate anion ox2 minus and then in the presence of calcium ions which would be there because of a high dietary calcium intake calcium binds to oxalate one one which then we excrete it we poop it out thereby limiting how much oxalate is absorbed and less oxalate absorption into the bloodstream means that there is a lower plasma oxalate concentration where it can then potentially limit accumulation and structural damage to tissues and organs now with that in mind how much dietary calcium is needed to minimize oxalate absorption so for that we're going to take a look at this paper which was a randomized control trial people were fed oxalate and they also fed varying amounts of calcium and then oxalate absorption was evaluated from from the intestine into the blood so on the y- axxis we've got oxalate absorption so how much of the uh initial amount was absorbed plotted against the calcium intake in milligrams per day so we can see that at very low calcium intakes oxalate absorption is relatively high so for a 200 mg calcium intake per day there's about a 177% oxalate absorption in other words to put put this into perspective 300 mig of oxalates is considered a high oxalate containing diet so for someone who's only eating 200 migs of calcium per day 51 of those milligrams of oxalate would be absorbed potentially increasing the plasma oxalate uh concentration but as the calcium uh levels increase as calcium intake increases from 200 to 1200 milligrams per day there's an almost perfectly inverse linear correlation between calcium intake with how much oxalate is then found in the blood and you can see the correlation coefficient is 9997 a perfectly linear correlation in this case would be- 1.0 so within that 200 to 1200 milligram range for calcium intake it's almost perfectly linear linearly inversely correlated with how much oxalate is absorbed all right so to put that into numbers for someone who is eating 12200 milligrams of calcium per day there's only 2.6% oxalate absorption so for for that person who's eating 300 mig of oxalate that means now only 8 mig of oxalate in contrast with the 51 for a 200 milligram calcium intake 200 milligram per day for someone taking in 1200 mig of calcium per day now only 8 mig of that 300 would be absorbed and potentially impacting the plasma levels of oxalate all right but what about at higher further further increasing the calcium uh intake so from 1,200 to 18800 mill of calcium per day we can see that the correlation isn't as strong from 200 to 1200 but oxalate absorption still decreases as the calcium increase uh dietary calcium intake increases from 1 1200 to 1,800 for example for someone eating, 1500 milligrams of calcium per day only 2% of oxalates will be absorbed so to put that into numbers for that 300 mg of oxalate only 6 mig of it would be absorbed and then potentially impacting plasma levels so if the goal is to minimize oxalate absorption we can eat a high calcium containing diet now that doesn't have to mean we're all eating dairy for example in my case i eat a lot of collared greens which do have a very small amount of oxalate relative to other greens like spinach they have 9 mig of oxalate per 100 gr of collard greens but you can see they also have 141 migs of calcium so i'm eating about a pound of collig greens a day which gives me about 600 mg of calcium with only about 40 mg of oxalate so a net 560 for calcium relative to how much oxalate is there but for those who want a more specific approach uh one way would be to measure plasma levels of oxalate to assess whether dietary intake may be too much but also note that plasma levels of oxalate is going to be an integrated measure of kidney function how much the liver is producing and if you have gut bacteria that can degrade it but there may be a more specific measure than just me measuring plasma oxalate and that's by looking at kidney function markers when considering that elevated plasma levels of oxalate can impair kidney function if we measure markers of kidney function including creatinine but then also as a better potential measure syat and c if those data are youthful then one's uh oxalate intake whatever it may be uh may be okay and not potentially damaging to the kidney all right that's all for now if you're interested in more my attempts to biack aging check us out
