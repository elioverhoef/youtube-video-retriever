# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #5 in 2020

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

My latest blood test results are in so what's my biological age so each of the variables for levine's phenotypic age otherwise known as biological age calculator are on the screen and we can see that my uh biological age is 34.54 years which compared to my chronological age 47 is 12 and a half years younger than my chronological age so uh in comparison uh the for the first four blood tests in 2020 i had values of 34 and a half 33.4 35.7 and on my last blood test which was the worst uh reading that i've had to date um 39.3 so on this latest blood test i was able to reduce my biological age by five years now also when taking the average of the five values for my biological age it's 35 and a half years now we can compare that to my 2019 value over two blood tests of 35.2 years to suggest that i've aged biologically by 0.3 years even though one full year on on the calendar has passed now i'm confident that i can further reduce my 34.54 to somewhere around 33 again um so stay tuned and also if i'm able to do that that may reduce that would likely reduce my average biological age potentially to somewhere around 35.2 35.2 which would be great because then it would suggest that i haven't aged biologically even though one full year has passed so stay tuned for that data so what's driving the five-year approximately five year uh reduction age reduction in biological age from test number four to test number five so here are a few of those variables and what we're looking at is the uh period uh that corresponds to this blood test is from july 28th through october 27th uh so that's the period that corresponds to blood test number five and for blood test number four it was a shorter period from june 24th through july uh 27th of 2020 so first my calorie intake between those two periods wasn't significantly different but it was 100 calories higher in this latest um period that corresponds to blood test number five now that even though those the calorie values weren't different between the two um different periods that extra 100 calories a day was sufficient to increase my body weight my average body weight i weigh myself daily too in addition to all the other things that i track my average body weight went up by two pounds so 100 calories a day is enough to raise your body weight i didn't exercise more frequently in this period when compared with the blood test number four measurement so i've coded um days that i exercised whether it was strength strength training um running or biking i don't include walking as an exercise day it's very low intensity so if i did any of those three things i coded it as one whereas if i didn't it was a zero so the frequency of my exercise um uh wasn't different between those two periods uh so cardiovascular metrics heart rate variability hrv and resting heart rate rhr i improved my fitness well at least for heart rate variability i uh significantly improved that by a small amount uh and my wrestling heart rate even though it was improved wasn't significantly different between the two uh periods but i'd argue that you know a small increase in hr uh wouldn't be enough to explain a five-year reduction in in biological age i find that hard to believe so i think it's more likely that there are components of my diet which i purposely changed for this dietary period compared to the last that may be impacting my biological age so what was different in my diet so a big data slide this is my average dietary intake uh for the period that corresponds to blood test number five versus the period that corresponds to blood test number four now i'm not going to go through all these data and the t-test indicates the p-values that you know indicates significant differences differences between the groups but for those who are interested in knowing what my diet is to have a younger or way younger by a biological age and my chronological age i wanted to include all the data so people who are interested in that can look at it i'm only going to focus on a few key points of dietary changes on the list so first compared to the period for blood test number four versus number five i purposely increased my uh vegetable intake by about 360 grams as you can see there so which vegetables did i increase well i increased my broccoli cauliflower those are the two major ones but i also increased the peas and i didn't highlight it but corn too i increased that by a little bit um so not just the vegetable intake that i change i also changed my yogurt intake how much yogurt uh full fat plain yogurt that i mix with berries that i was eating every day so what we can see is for blood test number five i cut it by about half compared with blood test number four so about 439 grams in for the previous period versus 234 grams for this period so why did i make those dietary changes prior to this blood test well a higher vegetable intake and this was data based on up to my previous blood test uh for for that data a higher vegetable intake was correlated with lower glucose and creatinine and a higher lymphocyte percentage now these are uh going in those directions are favorable for biological age and for more info on that i'll link uh to a video in the right corner where i discuss how each of these variables on the biological age calculator change during aging and disease risk so click that if you're interested all right so let's look at have a look at the data so first we're looking at um average my at my glucose levels versus my average daily vegetable intake and again this is data based on previous to this blood test that led me to change it for this blood test so what we can see is a negative correlation meaning the higher my average daily vegetable intake the lower my glucose levels and notice these aren't small relatively small amounts of vegetables this is you know in some cases 1700 grams a day which would be about 22 servings with 80 grams around 80 grams being considered a serving so higher average daily vegetable intake lower correlated with lower glucose similarly higher vegetable intake is also correlated with lower creatinine which is going in the right direction creatinine increases with age and higher levels of creatinine are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk now conversely having a higher average daily vegetable intake was cor is correlated or was correlated with a higher percentage of lymphocytes and we can see that correlation there it's very strong 0.81 and all of these correlations are statistically significant so the correlations for higher vegetable intake with the nine biomarkers on levine's biological age calculator weren't all going in the right direction one of them alkaline phosphatase aop so higher vegetables higher alp which is going in the wrong direction uh higher aop aop increases during aging and higher levels levels higher than 50 are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so the way i looked at it is improve three variables maybe one gets worse i see that as a net positive so um and also i didn't see significant associations for vegetable intake with albumin uh white blood cells mcv rdw or crp the other variable variables on the biological age calculator so i for this blood test blood test number five i increased my vegetable intake uh now whether the increased vegetable intake for this blood test caused improvements for glucose creatinine or the lymphocyte percentage is unknown but each of them went in the right direction all right so i also mentioned that i cut my yogurt intake in half why did i do that and i've talked about this a little bit in in another video so i'm not going to go too in depth but briefly so my glucose levels i've listed them here without yogurt and then with yogurt i went for a long time not eating yogurt in my diet and a shorter time obviously here having yogurt in my diet and what we can see is that my glucose levels including yogurt are significantly higher compared to when i don't have yogurt in my diet the same trend is true for creatinine with yogurt in my diet higher creatinine without yoga in my diet lower creatinine so um and these two groups of data are statistic they're different based on uh t-test p-values with the t-test so this would suggest that i should reduce or eliminate yogurt if i want to have lower glucose and creatinine now i'm not excited to cut yogurt completely out and one reason for that is because they seem to impact my red blood cell levels so this is what we're looking at red blood cell on the y axis versus yogurt intake and um when i didn't eat yogurt uh my red blood cell range and this is over the past five years from 2015 to 2020 correlations for again red blood cells versus yogurt intake average daily yogurt intake so we can see that without yogurt my red blood cell range was around 4.4 to 4.8 so why is that important well uh this is how red blood cells levels of red blood cells change during aging in both men and women with values in men around 4.8 being found in biological youth and red blood cell counts decrease during aging uh that's a bad thing because red blood cells carry oxygen if you don't have enough oxygen your cells can't use that oxygen to make it you know energy uh uh by mitochondria so you don't want your red blood cells to to be lower so um for whatever reason yogurt seems to impact them and my red blood cells increase and we can see that here so with more than 400 grams of yogurt a day my i was able to achieve red blood cell levels for the first time in years uh higher than five now i had one previous blood test uh where i had uh yogurt intakes of about 250 grams a day um and that still was able to keep my um red blood cell counts above five so with that in mind i decided again to shoot for around 250 grams of yogurt a day thinking that it would increase my red blood cells above 4.8 which would be indicative of biological youth but not too high where now it's negatively impacting my creatinine and glucose levels and maybe other stuff and sure enough that's exactly what i got so that dot that just popped up is where uh my red blood cell levels were uh that correspond to this blood test 4.97 so and along those lines my red blood cells red blood cells stayed relatively high i was able to reduce my creatinine levels to their lowest level in 2020 0.93 milligrams per deciliter which is good and then my glucose levels improve from 99 to 96 compared to the last blood test but that's not low enough for glucose values between 80 to 94 are optimal i've made other videos talking about that so i need to identify other factors that are impacting my glucose levels so what foods may impact them so um interestingly about a year ago i changed my diet from my a pound or more of carrots per day to get enough beta-carotene to potentially optimize my abdomen levels to us orange sweet potatoes and with an equivalent amount of orange sweet potatoes to get around 55 milligrams or 55 000 micrograms of beta-carote beta-carotene per day so i did that thinking that carrots have a lot of sugar a lot of sucrose and that would likely be bad for health so interestingly though and again this is data prior to this blood test so having a higher average daily sweet potato intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose levels i don't know why that is but this is what the data it you know it is what it is interestingly too having a higher carrot intake is negatively correlated with my glucose levels so in other words having a higher carrot intake is correlated with lower glucose levels so based on this data for my next blood test i'm gonna uh make sure i'm eating a ton of carrots a day back to a pound or more a day and i'm gonna reduce the frequency that i eat uh orange sweet potatoes now that that that isn't going to be the only dietary change that i make for my next blood test i'm also going to add beets back into my diet so i used to eat beets raw beets in smoothies uh often and i basically stopped doing that um you know i had some abdominal pain maybe i was eating too many beets you know 10 to 12 ounces at a time so for whatever reason that was causing you know some bloating and abdominal pain so i cut them completely out uh and interestingly we can see with the with the uh graph here with the chart um so when i don't have beets in my diet or didn't or have very little amounts of them we can see glucose levels always higher than 90. But when i i've had beets in my diet my average glucose levels were almost always less than 90. So with that in mind i'm going to add beets back in around four to five ounces around you know 120 to 150 grams of beets per day in my smoothie and um we'll see how that impacts my glucose levels going forward so crp is another way i can improve uh it's it's another place where i can prove improving on my blood test this current blood test uh 0.84 is still about double where it usually is for me and it jumped up in the last couple measure in the last couple measurements so it's imperative i get that down since it increases during aging and higher levels levels higher than 0.3 around 0.3 are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in many studies and again i've covered that in in other videos that i'll link that to in the right corner for for more info so which foods are significantly correlated with crp so first um and this is again shocking to me but uh we what we can see here is that uh for uh my average daily flaxseed intake as that increases crp also increases and that's a strong correlation of 0.71 it's and it's significant with a p-value of 0.02 so that's shocking to me i didn't expect to see a correlation for higher flaxseeds with a higher crp and i should mention i looked for correlations between all of my food intake with crp and this was the strongest correlation that i identified so with this in mind just that should be simple i'm not eating a ton of flaxseed this at most is you know maybe 12 grams per day on average just reduce flaxseed intake and maybe that's enough to lower crp well uh you know improve one bar biomarker maybe make another worse and the reason i say that is because higher flaxseed is correlated with lower creatinine for whatever reason my creatinine has been increasing over the past year or so so i'm trying to keep that uh you know from uh going in the age-related increase which you know that's it's hard to beat nature right so but i'm trying my best through diet to try to optimize all my biomarkers so i can resist age-related increase so based on the flaxseed creatinine data that was just keeping it in so uh i should mention no other foods reached uh statistical significance for the correlation with crp but coconut butter was close so higher levels of coconut butter and again not coconut oil but the coconut butter which is a mix of the coconut meat and the coconut milk and it's blended and it basically looks like peanut butter i mean you scoop it out of a jar so um higher levels of that was correlated were correlated with lower levels of crp but that was close to significance with the p-value of 0.08 now that will become more important in a second so i i then went past the foods that were associated with crp and i looked at for more insight potentially more insight which uh of the other biomarkers that are found on the chem panel standard chem panel and cbc are correlated with crp and the strong strongest correlation there was for crp with total cholesterol uh so in this case higher levels of total cholesterol for me are correlated with lower levels of crp so then the obvious question is well what can i do to increase my total cholesterol keep it high for this measurement even though total cholesterol isn't on this blood test the you know for the phenotypic age calculator my blood my total cholesterol was 133 so i have room to improve it so which foods are correlated with total cholesterol which what can i eat to to keep it high uh and i just heard all the meat eaters say just eat more meat cheese and eggs but uh that may have some negative consequences on my on my diet i've covered that in other videos so interestingly again coconut butter higher levels of coconut butter are correlated with higher levels of total cholesterol for me so when considering that i also saw correlation even though it wasn't statistic significant but close to significance for coconut butter with crp these data collectively would suggest that higher coconut butter higher total cholesterol and however total cholesterol seems to be impacting my crp potentially lower crp so i'm gonna also for the next blood test increase my coconut butter intake uh from about 20 ish grams you know 20 ish grams per day to more than 30 somewhere in the 35 to 40 grams gram range and see how it impacts the blood test hopefully it doesn't mess up the other stuff and it just um reduces the crp all right that's all i've got for now um have a great day
