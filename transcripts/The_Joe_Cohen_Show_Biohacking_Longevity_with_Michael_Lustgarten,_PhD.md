# The Joe Cohen Show: Biohacking Longevity with Michael Lustgarten, PhD

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Welcome to the joe cohen show join me as i share my experience with biohacking and invite top health experts to explore the latest technology supplements research and resources for optimizing your body and [music] brain hey everyone i'm here with dr michael lgarden he is a scientist and the person behind the youtube channel conquer aging or die trying where he details his biohacking journey to try to live longer than everyone that has ever lived so this is the second time he's on the podcast he's written a number of papers i actually invited him on the podcast because i saw an interesting paper on the gut microbiome and sceletal muscle mass and physical function that he published in it was a review paper i think in 2019 but in any case he knows a lot about lab tests and i wanted to the last time i had him on we spoke about la test i want to pick his brain about new insights he has what he does to live longer or die trying and uh yeah what kind of testing he does what kind of markers he's looking at what kind of uh things he does to get in the optimal range so let's just you know let's make this a little casual i want to shoot some questions see where we're going to go with it and and then we'll go down some kind of rabbit hole but essentially i think overall we're going to talk about markers lab markers and how to measure what you're doing is working right because i think that's extremely important especially if your goal is longevity you have to use objective markers you can't just be like i feel good and then somebody else may feel good and you might die in a heart from a heart attack or from something that you could measure so there's all kinds of tests that you could measure and one of the things i really love about lab testing and something i've realized over time is that for every marker you have an optimal range right and and i think you agree with that is that correct yeah yeah so you have an optimal range and that optimal range is the ideal range for the lowest risk of mortality and the lowest risk of dying and sometimes it's just an association in which case it's still valuable right because if it's just an association you could still see if you have that association right and sometimes it's causal as well which is even more valuable because then actually changing the marker will change the result you want to but the idea is that you want to try to get as many markers as you can in the optimal range and sometimes if there's if you have a genetic predisposition for something just being a little higher whatever that's also fine and that's why it's also good to know some your genetic predispositions especially for markers that are not causal and yeah and then doing as much testing is possible to see where you're at so let's get into it how many let's can we start with how many supp supps you take a day i have no idea wait so first hey joe thanks for having me on so i i supplement based on demonstrated need and not just demonstrated need on it's demonstrated need after i've attempted to tweak everything by diet exercise sleep etc and then when i can't make a dent there then i do supplements so for example vitamin d i take that probably eight or nine months in the year because i'm in boston i'm not on the beach in miami year round if i was i wouldn't be taking vitamin d at all but then i also my nad blood levels of nad are relatively low for my chronological age so i've been tinkering around with all the ned precursors and trying to get that up higher but even there i've trying to tweak the diet so basically if when a a given biomarker is quote unquote out of range or not youthful i'm trying to make little tweaks in the diet to get them into that quote unquote optimal range without messing up all the others that are already pretty close to the youthful or optimal range so in terms of supplements right now methyl b12 vitamin d that's it nothing else oh wow okay we have a very different approach with that i i go more of the brian johnson approach but i i'm very curious to see what kind of results you have with that approach because so wait so the the worry that i have with the supplements is tolerance potential tolerance over time like now it would tolerance be a real thing i don't know that's one factor but the other side of that is if i can't do everything i can just by the foods that i'm eating and and it doesn't have to be food i'm open to the supplements like i said but demonstrated need if i can't do everything by food what's going to happen when i really need that supplement right and if i take the supplement only when i really need it i think that would be the most efficacious that should be when it works the most but if i've been taking that suppl for 30 years and all of a sudden i'm taking metformin for glucose and then it stops working what am i going to do right so i don't want to be in that in that boat interesting that's a interesting that's an interesting perspective that i i hadn't heard of before meaning like you're saying that if you take it now if you really need it it's not going to be as effective maybe it might not be i just don't know what the tolerance effects would be over time but that definitely is a possibility for example type two diabetics that are insulin dependent eventually it it it just doesn't work as well as it used to and then what do you do and then conventional medicine their approaches will just give you more insulin which is a disaster physiologically yeah i i do everything i can like i'll give you an example blood glucose increases during aging i started to see that but i was playing with my diet because of this heavy pop culture focus on go high fat if you go high fat you shouldn't have high glucose right okay let's see so i went up to 120 grams of fat on i don't know whatever it was that for me that right now that's high 120 grams of fat per day and in conjunction with that increasing glucose and i should say too that for every blood test glucose went up when you increased the fat that you ate yep and not just fat this wasn't seed oils this is from whole food i don't just have blood test data for every blood test i track my diet every day weigh everything i eat literally everything i don't eat out if i do eat out it's a rare thing every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake if there's 60 days in between tests the 60-day average corresponds to that test and because i've got almost 50 blood tests now going back to 2015 i can look at correlations in my data like statistical correlations not just one test or two tests so i could see with the the total fat with glucose the positive correlation and so i cut the fat intake and sure enough glucose came down it was like something like 18 consecutive blood tests in the 90s for blood glucose and as soon as i cut fat and i'm not talking about fat like cutting it to 50 grams no it was just from like 115 120 to 80 grams per day which is where my data currently is and that's still 40% of my calories coming from fat so interesting but even have you looked at like it could be like genetically related genx thing there so the reason i don't think that's true is because 2015 blood glucose was consistently in the low to mid 80s and then all of the sudden it started increase and so what it's got to be something that caused that or quote unquote age right you're talking about fasting glucose or you're talking about fasting glucose fasting okay what about the hba1c did that go up as well so i've only started to measure that recently and on my last test in october it was 5.1% % which is super super good right okay but the fasting glucose doesn't really mean that much if the hba1c and you also have a now i i'll give you an example like for me my fasting glucose does go up probably with a higher fast higher fat diet however my hba1c does not and i've been measuring hb1 a1c for a while and also i used a continuous glucose monitor for two weeks and my glucose was quite stable throughout time sometimes you could have some kind of messed up number from hba1c or whatever that's not accurate for whatever reason but it coincided with my continuous glucose monitor and so the fact that my cortisol was high in the morning i think just means that i had a spike in cortisol in the morning when i wake up and if it's higher by a couple points i don't what does that really mean is that a bad is that bad you think ifer glucose is bad so hb1c is just one measure of glycation or yeah glycation right so lots of other proteins in the blood can be glycated i'm not saying that hb1c is a bad measure i'm not saying that at all but i'm thinking about doing my glycin age to see the at least for the imunoglobulin to see what's the full spectrum but to properly control that experiment with the glucose being relatively higher in the 90s i didn't track hba1c for all of those tests i only have it after shifting my fat intake back down into the 80s and i should say too that it it's not just higher fat in my case being significantly correlated with higher glucose because i'm looking at like a panel of 25 or so different biomarkers there were a ton of biomarkers going in the wrong direction versus right so it was an easy cut i should say to went in the wrong direction oh boy off the top of my head i've gota i've got to open up my data and look at all the all the correlations but pri rdw crp but this i'd have to go back and actually look at the data crp went up with more fat yeah actually my crp has been less than the limit of detection for 14 or 15 consecutive tests in a row yeah it was you're not testing the hs crp right hs hs crp yeah it's below the limit of detection the hsp which is one back then it was 6 to one consistently milligram per liter but there could be could what was the limit of detection you said it below point oh the quest lab here is.3 milligrams per liter i've had i see yeah but i i'd have to look at the correlations my list of all the data actually red blood cells which is interesting because they declined during aging i quote unquote revers that but then when i looked at the correlations higher red blood cells in my case above five higher was significantly correlated with higher glucose so those are two of the fat was significantly correlated with so there is data for example hemoglobin which declines during aging you'd expect that higher levels of hemoglobin should be good knowing that it declines during aging but even too high going above 16 grams uh milligrams per deciliter increased all cause mortality risk so for whatever reason going higher fat in my case higher red blood cells higher hemoglobin higher glucose it's probably without measuring it probably increased blood viscosity too with a higher red blood cells so what is your red blood cell number right now it's 47 47 okay and hemoglobin 15.1 which is exactly where i wanted those are as close to youthful as you can get but there isn't there's a higher range basically it's not just red blood cells in hemoglobin decline during aging in my case there seems to be the opposite extreme where if i go too higher for red blood cells that ends up being too high for hemoglobin too higher for glucose stuff's going in the wrong directions okay so you're saying if you have too much if you have too much fat your hemoglobin and red blood cells go up too much in my case yep okay interesting so it goes up beyond let's say 16 for hemoglobin and what do you want to keep your red blood cells under so 47 48 or in the 46 to four 46 to 48 range for me i i want to keep it there and not just that i want to avoid any age related decline but it's easily malleable i i find that it's easily malleable by diet and i have the correlations with what there's stuff in my diet like flax seeds which are inversely correlated with red blood cells meaning lower red blood cells with higher flax seed so i have to be careful not to go too high for that to try to make sure i don't so it's all about finding what's the optimal dose for the even what is the highest mort like when does mortality start to go up with he with red blood cells is that beyond 4.8 so red blood cells there are very few studies that where that's been looked at but hemoglobin is extensively studied on all cause mortality risk and hemoglobin's in inside red blood cells so in most studies unfortunately they're only looking at like anemia when red blood cells get to the point of anemia or hemoglobin getting below i think 12 milligrams per deciliter but i think in men it's less than four increas i'd have to look at the data i don't remember it off the top of my head but yeah we have let's see what do we have is the optimal range here we have up to 16 for men for hemoglobin and again i mean there might be some increased mortality but i can imagine we put a little higher female globin because there's also benefits yeah the risk there i think well yeah i think over 16 in the study i have in mind there was like 300,000 people men and women over 16 increased all cause mortality risk it could just be men i've got to pull up the data though to refresh that's over 16 so then under six so up to 16 is fine you also don't want to have under 14 14 to 16 yeah that sounds about i may have helped design that range which is crazy that sounds like my range 14 to 16 for men could be we did review all the ranges somewhat recently to see what the new papers like could be that stayed consistent for a while yeah it's not just uh 14 to 16 maybe the optimal range in men it's then avoiding the age related decline so maybe you start out at 15.8 153 148 age related trends something it's going in the wrong direction so i look at it as both you need both of that is that because the testosterone is important for red blood cells and hemoglobin right could be it could be one factor for sure yep kidney function makes epo so it could be testosterone kidney function red blood side it could be yeah okay that makes sense that's i find that really interesting that you don't take any supplements that's like very unique in this field right because you're really into anti-aging you got your conquer aging s shirt or di or di okay yeah and that's and you don't take any supplements because what i find is that if i don't take any supplements my i have a bunch of lab markers that are not in the optimal range and there's certain i need to okay do you believe in the true diagnostic test at all for example you were on that board i take that oh leader board yeah what was your number let's see rejuven do you remember yeah so i they have two different leaderboards one is most improved and then the other is the absolute six-month three test average i should be on i'm more interested in the absolute three test average over six months i should be on that leaderboard but they brian johnson and and uh his doctor olie zman they have some screwy rules about if i had three tests in five months i don't get on the leaderboard if i had six tests in five months like how do you take the most recent three tests how how so one second so what is what's your number here most recent test is you got a 76 and your oldest two averag is 0855 so that's because so here's the interesting story which goes to supplementation you know i said i mentioned my ned levels are low or relatively low so i was taking 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day to try to boost nad i tripled my ned levels but my denum paste 16 wait 600 milligrams of what were you taking nicotinic acid yeah so it i have 10 tests for true diagnostics since 2022 eight of those tests are 082 or lower 098 on the day same day as the test 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid which suggests nicotinic acid increases your rate of aging very high dose because then i repeated the test with uh 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid it raised nad to 39 micromolar not as high and the epigenetic age on that day was like denan pce was like 08 or something reasonable in my normal range okay it's just very high dose now the question is it a high nicotinic acid dose or is a high nad dose so i did that experiment i took grams of nmn per day nad 60 micromolar just like with highd dose nicotinic acid i don't have those results yet back from true diagnostic but if they're 0.9 something again ridiculous which is an outlier in my data the very high nad could be bad for epigenetic aging okay that's very interesting so you why did you decide on 600 milligrams is that because you were is it because you were checking your nad levels and that's where it got optimized so there there's a paper that shows that it's called nasin cure systemic nad deficiency rct in people i think they used a higher dose it was like a th000 milligrams of nicotinic acid and i've actually used up to three grams in the past for lipoprotein a so i was like all right 600 i don't know i'll just let's just see and then once i saw the t needum pace and it didn't affect glucose which it's been shown to do in my case for that one test but yeah i cut the dose down no flush the flush on 600 milligrams per day is outrageous for me so i'm happy to make that change but now i'm actually trying to i took n nicenic acid out and i'm actually trying to increase nad without messing up d paste by using by increasing trigonelline in my diet increasing dietary intake of that i don't know if you've heard of trigonelline one second trigonelline i heard of it yeah no um it's on my radar but i don't know it's a metabolite right how you also supplement with it no diet first diet okay what do with your diet to increase trigel you're trying to increase trigonelline yep so trigonelline is methyl nicotinic acid it's just a methyl group added to to anin right so chickpeas coffee is a great source but i'm not a coffee drinker i have green tea every day i i just don't have the hydration space for more fluid and i hate the idea of coffee breath but chickpeas are a pretty good source of trigonelline so i didn't have any people have been on me for a long time why don't you have legumes in your diet it's a proong longevity blue zones all this and i'm like look at my data what's it going to it hasn't i don't have any room so i took out barley and oats which isn't a only like six 60 grams per day total it's not a lot but in making that shift i can get about 20 milligrams of trigonelline per day from chickpeas which doesn't seem like a lot but consider that 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day increases nad this is really interesting so i took the dun dunadan pace test twice yep and the first time i took it i was on high do nin high do and i was also trying i was doing it to get my lpa down and it didn't work so i just stopped it and it also messed up other labs like hba1c it messed up it increased my liver enzymes a little bit things that are actually shown in the research and it also lowered my thyroid hormone so it was an experiment and the reason i did the experiment is because i realized that i did a couple tests that indicated that i needed more nyin and and then i took nys i felt really great on it and that was like 100 200 milligrams basically up to 500 milligrams i feel really great on it more than that at at some point i don't know exactly what that point is yet so that's what i have to figure out where is the turning point is it 200 milligrams is it 300 400 my rule of thumb now is to keep it under 500 milligrams and yeah and but i was taking at that point the first test i was taking about 1300 milligrams my dunid in paste was wait for 0.72 i was taking i i i was probably taking taking about 250 milligrams of nyin and my second result i'm going to take the test again in february but my second result came out as 0.63 nice all right wait you don't was so you had nicotinic acid for both right yeah but one was higher dose nice and and then i realized i actually didn't realize what it was doing to my pace of aging right i wasn't taking it off i was mainly doing it because there was certain labs that i saw were that i knew were actually this is a side effect of nin and the benefits weren't as large as i had expected meaning there is a very big there's a significant dose response curve the more you take you take a little bit all of a sudden you get a really good effect and then you take too much it just keeps going down from there and that's just something i measured which is why i do the pretty extensive lab testing and it also go based on how i feel plus the la la testing and i'm at a place now where i'm pretty sure 200 milligrams is completely fine for me even if my methylation even if my pace of aging goes up because i feel like meaning like i don't trust it to the point where i'm going to be like oh it goes up a little because of this i'm not going to do this because there's a lot of other factors i look at and i feel like 200 milligrams a day is for me then the question is it 300 is it 400 more than 500 i start to realize it's probably not good so it's i'm still trying to see what is the optimal dose for me and that's something i got to figure out but essentially i also took it for other reasons to counteract food sensitivities it actually nice and deficiency and the lack of i i've always had a nice and deficiency and i think that was in part causing a lot of food sensitivities and so i was trying to reverse the food sensitivities with that but yeah it caused side effects and when i think when i was the it seems from my notes that the 0.63 was i was taking about 200 milligrams a day maybe a little more 250 so 250 for that l latest test for the first test was 1300 worse done and pace better done and pace with the lower dose nicotin there may be something i i made other changes though i made other changes yeah so it's with the dunad in pace it's a little hard because i'm making a bunch of changes and i'm making changes based on how i feel what's going on in my body based on my lab markers so i look at specific lab markers and see okay my what would you say my approach was do the kitchen sink go push as hard as you can and see what happens right you see things worsening or getting better what are the most supplements that i can take until things start to get worse that's essentially what i did just all right let me keep oh i'm taking so i went up from i think when we spoke last in 2018 i was probably taking 25 a day and then and it was consistent that's been like pretty consistent for number of years and then a year and a half ago i said okay that's it i'm gonna i think i no it was like two years ago or two and a half years ago i think i went up to 40 already a day and then it went to 50 and then all of a a year and a half ago i said okay what's the limit here i'm going to do everything that i can to like optimize every buy marker and then so i just went i i went at it hard and so then i remember i had this video that went viral i said i was taking 70 supplements a day right and that that was about a year ago and then it went to 80 and then 90 and then 100 and then at my max it's about 150 and then i started to see that hey there are some side effects so the side effects that i was getting number one was my thyroid hormones went down so i had to look at every single supplement that i took and saw which ones lowered thyroid hormones and it was some random ashes some of them i already knew like nasin and in carnitine and so those were just like okay i know this is i got to there were a lot of other reasons why i was taking those so it was a little it was a little tricky but i just said okay i'm taking these out whatever and so that that helped my thyroid hormones and then there were some of them that were just like i didn't realize and it was like i would have never known like propolis who knows who would know that propolis lowers thyroid you took out thyroid thyroid went i took out everything that was about 10 things i took out that hurt thyroid hormones i was like okay out it goes and and then i looked at my test again and number not only did my i also took okay so then basically i've been pushing my body also more than ever in my life by far so i used to never work out what i did always was probably like one push-up a day i would walk a lot no like one set and then and i would walk a lot that was that would be my exercise so i'd get like a little bit of a and then maybe once in a while i would jog or once in the blue moon i used to bike or whatever i i always tried to be active in the sense of like i had a treadmill desk and so that was my exercise just walk as much as i can and it would usually be one two hours a day maybe three sometimes but essentially try to get two hours in and then try to get at least one set of push-ups in or something like that different time periods of my life but try to get a little bit of strength or with a little bit of cardio or whatever it is is and then a year and a half ago i basically said okay i'm i have all this knowledge about all these lab markers and all these supplements i'm like i'm not even using h most of the knowledge i have on myself let me use myself as a skinny pig where i'm just going to go full hog supplements diet everything boom and the other thing is i also have these limitations where it's okay i there's certain things i do that i know are not good i go to sleep late i screw up my circadian rhythm which which is pretty basic but it's just like there's there's a trade-off so the question is what would happen if you took out all the supplements would your donan pace be 6 would it be point would it be worse no i'm pretty sure it would be worse i don't know sure i can't know until i do the test but when i take out the supplements i notice things are worse in for example dud d dunit in pace has to do with how stressed you are there's 10 supplements i take to reduce psychosocial stress and and when i take them i'm not stressed so i think that for example just helps me not be stressed whereas if i don't take them i will be very stressed i'll be more of a more of a nervous kind of guy and now i'm just like pretty chill like i don't get stressed it's very hard to stress me out yeah so that's one thing that that and and that's like the number one thing they have like these things that that help the most and stress is like number one yeah right you can quantif that's why i'm saying i do know you can quantify granted emotional stress is going to be different from the actual physiological stress but you can quant d track heart rate variability and resting heart rate i've had work days where just crazy emotional work stress it looks like i ran for two hour 2our half marathon the next day so for me i i get it stress is a big deal it can be i mean it only it might only hurt my hrv if it hurts my sleep so it doesn't it's not really measuring stress in the day for me so i could be stressed and then as long as it doesn't hurt my sleep which it does often so in which case it will hurt my hrv but otherwise no but i also think they they have some data about things that help reduce the biological agent there's a lot of supplements on their list yeah so my latest test was like i don't know 0 75 so not too far off but the other variable here is chronological age it increases donan pace increases with chronological age so i think so someone who's 880 has an average dead ean pace of one versus someone like seam land who's in his 20s averages like seven just without doing anything so you how old are you 30 36 all right so i'm a little 14 i got 14 years chronological age now i'm not playing that game we no let's play that game if we no i think it's leg game to play yeah yeah i want to be any let's convert d so i actually asked ryan this what would be the what's the coefficient every year to to keep it to standardized it across age yeah because like you say if if somebody who's 100 has doing it in pace of that's going to be way better than yeah someone who's in their 20s and had the person on the leaderboard is 15 years old some dude who's a private participant that oh that's probably brian johnson's son there's a woman on there she's 55 i i think her donan pace is like it's really low 6 something right i saw that 65 yeah the other side of the equation isn't just that donan pace increases during aging women live longer than men right so wouldn't you expect that women should have a lower d pace so automatically the test is i don't want to say biased but the youth young the younger you are chronologically and if you're a woman you should have great data it's going to be harder for let's try to standardize it you're saying if somebody's 80 they they would have a one something like that yeah i'd have to pull up the pl how does that even make sense though because you're saying if they assuming they were like really good they'd have won average the aver so if you look at average okay yeah it's in their it's in their report right so if you pull up their report at some point you can't see it exactly for each one it's see the line you see the line you see the data point yeah you see the slope with all the data points and then chronological age so you could just extrapolate 80y old it's approximately one and then six 20 year old it's whatever the number is i don't want mine to increase during aging but i'm just saying let's say we we standardize it and you're 14 years older oh right that would give that means that if we standardize it you should be let's say four four and a half points it should be four four and a half years0 four five wait that might be very high it might be a 100th 01 per year right to go from 20.7 around 20 years old to 1.0 at 80 you have3 units over 60 years so you just divide that right what you get 02 02 022 i meant yeah yeah no yeah 0.02 per year something like that yeah something like that yeah because i think it's important to make that equivalent because then we could really see who's also there's a lot of genetics to this as well yeah and you could say well you have great genetics or whatever right so that's where you started so yeah if you have longevity dna in your family if your parents liv to 100 or older and then my parents were dead or grandparents were dead at 65 and my done eating paces whatever lower at the same chronological age versus longevity genes but so i i try not to compete against others in this for me it's what's the lowest that i can get to and then keeping it there indefinitely i'm not opposed to the supplements that that may be a part of the appro eventually where just everything i'm doing doesn't work so that like i said no so it's not if it works or not the question is can you get better results with supplements yeah so it's not so then it's not just like one bi marker improves it's got to be the net effect for me so correct my most recent it's 78 that's from oh okay november that's old data that's another thing they how many of these tests did you take so i tested seven times in 2023 think about it like how many how many tests do you need on a yearly basis to get a true representation of where your data is for year-to-year change and i care about year-to-year change i want to make sure i'm keeping stuff youthful so i need a lot of blood test data right the thing is is that i'm still unclear on exactly meaning when you look at the data they say you can look if somebody has a higher dunit in pace or whatever your mortality is 1.6 something okay if you look at things like v2 max it's going to be much more significant than that ryan says that this stuff is all included but i don't see how the numbers add up right i look at mortality rates for a bunch of lab markers and there's a lot of lab markers that if they're out of the range your mortality is going to be 1.6 something or whatever right somewhere in that between above 1.5 now some of them are a little lower it depends on the lab so i looking at it like it's really like people on the cutting edge who are really cuz if you're not just get a freaking cbc get your cbc cmp right unless you really have all those lab results dialed in you're not gonna you're not gonna get the max benefit from these more advanced tests but that's a good point about vo2 max the prediction would be someone with the highest v2 max should have the lowest the need and pace right but then there's probably some nuance there where does where's that upper limit right is an ultra endurance athlete who's doing like a 72-hour run is there den and p going to be 6 or is it going to be like 1.3 something outrageous right so the thing is that's why the problem whether it's dunit in pace or any single lab test or v2 max there's limitations on the test and so you want to go for the most i think there's certain tests basic tests that you want to that are most important for every individual we actually have a suggested labs feature i don't know i don't know if you're on selfy code but we have a suggested laps feature where we look at your genetic risk and we tell you which labs are most important to check for so i i the way and i think it's a pretty cool tool because it actually like the stuff that comes up for me is yeah these are actually stuff that are out of the optimal range that i had to get in the optimal range and so it's a cool test if you're not going to do every lab test like me or i don't know you do 50 but like i do 300 at a time if you're not going to do that number and doing it in pace and this that like i'm i plan on doing every test out out there and doing them multiple times like i haven't gotten to every test yet but i'm going actually save the organic aets test to later because i the my theory was the way i looked at it is let me do all the let me dial in all the tests that have the most research behind them and the organic acids is like it doesn't it just doesn't have the research so it's you have to work based on theories and biochemical knowledge and i feel like that's people are taking that test first i'm like no that's the last test you take you know what i'm saying agre so wait metabolomics which goes to the organic acids point so that is a part of the approach too so it's not it's the cbc which has about 25 biomarkers immune cells metabolic health kidney function liver function inflammation that's a standard that's the foundation but then i've added donan pace horvath tiir length which may not be as important as a biological predictor as some other test but it's still it's a hallmark of aging but then the metabolomics which has 600 blood test blood biomarkers right so it's like you said there's so much data what's the most uh what has the most research so i've been focusing on things like the kine at tryptophan ratio which is in integrated measure of many pro and anti-inflammatory inputs epa and d how are you measuring that so it's in the metabolomic it's a there's a kit i use iolo's kit yeah but so then that's there's a ton of research behind it it's just not popularized epa and dha fish oil fatty acids which okay the superficially is eat more fish i have five blood tests and i can calculate correlations and fish intake and and and i eat fish every day and even fish oil i supplemented with fish oil not significantly correlated with epa or dha so making sure that doesn't decline during aging because that's associated with all cause mortality risk so then also i'm tracking so there are ureic uh metabolites which means that these are metabolites that are well known to increase in the presence of like chronic ky disease so creatinine is good catin c is good blood u nitrogen is a marker because it increases with poor kidney function uric acid okay but then there there are these other quote unquote ureic metabolites there's like hundreds of them that are known to increase during poor kidney function which maybe like a first signal you know before creatinine goes up or blood urine so i'm actually tracking that too which one sad c besides the stattin c so it's indoxyl sulfate these are gut bacteria derived yeah yeah these are ureic toxins okay yep parresol sulfate indoxyl sulfate tmao which could be coming from fish to so i don't know but so that too is on my radar but then you could even take are these elevated when you tested them no none of them are elevated but knowing that they increase during aging they increase poor kidney function i'm trying to keep that figure out the recipe to keep them as low as i have a range but it's still on the low side and you're trying to do this all with diet lifestyle just diet and lifestyle you got it y for now and i try to all do it with supplements it works though you want to hear about the one health hack that is sure to change your life okay here it is subscribing to this podcast 67%

your health journey all while helping keep us ad free like i used to be like a a like a little bit of loner in california whereas i didn't really have friends and i didn't go anywhere it was just wasn't exposed to germs if i i played volleyball and but that's outside you're not really going to get sick and then all of a sudden i moved to israel and i'm exposed to i'm going out whatever indoors gym this that yoga studio everything's indoors here and i'm just but i i don't care i'm just getting exposed to everything i'm traveling more and i'm just like all right that's it got to expose myself and build up my immune system so that my immune system can handle all this stuff and then at the same time because my immune system was a breaking point right like it was pretty weak in the past where i like i i get exposed boom i get sick so i'm on a roll now where i felt that my body fought off an infection four times now and i didn't get sick which is which is definitely a record for me by far there there's so all it's all the fun stuff is good right i did that i did that a couple times already and i just didn't get sick yeah so there is so cumulative burden i get the build the immune system part of it but then cumulative so there are viruses that could lay latent for decades until the there's like some mild transient immunosuppression and then those viruses reactivate like epstein bar virus is a great example of that where you can be infected when all right so that's not an issue for you but i'm just the general idea of cumulative burden of infection can lead to problems later in life so i get to build the immune system part but i don't know i try to be cautious so you got the found the foundation though so sleep right i'm sure you got leaner which means you probably lost a little bit of improved body composition lost some body fat right and regular exercise so that's like the foundation how much everything else is adding on top you've got a lot of that dialed in but wait so my 14-year-old had covid in i don't know may april something like that so she tested tested positive like 9 days in a row i'm in a two-bedroom apartment and so i'm like i'm definitely going to get it didn't get it didn't get it she tested positive nine days in a row i didn't get it so i don't know if that's my immune system i don't know somehow i was just able to stay away from it but different approach but still same results staying away from getting infected i was going to say two concerns right so liver enzymes what are your liver enzymes with all the supplements because brian's he posts like single data points he doesn't post i know i i don't like it i don't like that i agree so i i'll show you the full data yeah here's the here's the full data points and you could see what i'm talking about so you tell me a marker and i'll i'll give you my full data points let me bring it up lt okay let's see i started taking them here it october this is where i i went pretty hard on i started going hard on supplements can it's a little small for me i don't know if oh too big all right so you want it to be less than 30 that's for sure somewhere in the low 20s lowest all cause mortality risk i looked at the all cause mortality though um it depends i actually i only found 40 is mortality risk going up now some of the times i do take it it it does like here it's 25 25 that's i'm not worried about that 30s the ones that are 35 34 39 and then it's i i would take the average year to year and then compare that um oh you tested a lot gez november 4th november 9th i can send you that p it's 14 million people all cause mortality it's the biggest study i know alt so low 20s was lowest risk but that could be for other reasons as well it's not because it's generally it's a test for like fatty liver which i have very low fat right but if the liver enzymes are in the blood there's an increased turnover of liver cells meaning that there's an increased degradation which suggests more liver damage at a 30s versus the lower 20s what's the mortality risk increase from example for having let's see so if we look at i'm just yeah you tell us what the i think it's inre risk 30% i think it's 30% for higher than around 30 and then the lowest risk it was like 18 to 22 median values all right so i just looked it up by the way and again i'm just i looked at the first study that came up so this one it says lowest was 16 to 25 ah sample size you the sample size 49,000 i've got a study of like 14 million that i could pull up hang on uh i gotta go to my notes it's crazy but it's saying let's see it's higher than 56 a s a significant association of higher mortality risk was noted highest mortality rates were also revealed at serum alt levels more than 56 yeah but you want to go with the largest sample size you could find 50,000 is good but 14 million people it's a huge low alt also predicts all cause mortality yep that's true we consider low as here low normal is less than 17 they yeah yeah yep and that's actually very significant 1.6 which is like that dunit in pace we suggest that low normal may serve as an independent predictor for increased long-term mentality i wonder yeah i'd have to see what their chart says their graph but so we see under 17 is not good yeah that's why i think that's probably why we have 17 here could make sense there's probably more studies but 17 you don't want to have under 17 and then what do we have yeah what is your i'm looking at there we go all right so what is a choice it's actually 16.6 million people a median value 20 so lowest so the reference was 20 and then 21 to 23 lowest all cause mortality risk for a and then the you have to look at what the rate of incre like what is the mortality rate of having higher a little bit higher level so let's my for for a 27 an as of median value 27 30% higher risk compared to a 20 similar data for alt i got i'll send you the study here by the way this was higher when i was taking nice and that was one of the reasons why it does fluctuate let's see yeah there there might be a few supplements that that are increasing a little bit but i don't think anything it's not too significant like my normal baseline without much supplements is like 23 or let's say without would be good once it gets 27 29 in the 30s yeah it's going in the wrong direction now would something in the 30s consistently be 30% okay how many decades do you need it to be 30 something versus 20 low 20s to make a dent on mortality risk i don't know but yeah i try to get it for me i try to get it out of the 30s my data actually was in the 30s from too much omega 6 just from eating like too many walnuts or i don't know what was correlated actually too much fruit fructose too i used to eat a lot more fruit once i start once i saw the the correlations i was like all right i'll cut the fruit down in half cut the walnuts down and now dat is consistently low 20s but i don't have supplements i don't have 100 supplements to and brian's got that same he's got his al was like 34 and then i comment commented that on twitter under his post when he posted that and somebody was like yeah he probably did a workout the day before and i'm like how are you gon to measure your blood test the day after you do a hard workout that's just stupid like you're confounding your results okay so you're saying what is the risk goes up 30% of having a uh over 30 so it's for an a a median as of 27 versus a 20 30% higher risk i i'll send you the paper this is uh 16.6 million people it's uh table one or two table two maybe me open it up as far as i know this is the largest epidemiological study ever done for this okay implic a nationwide populationbased cohort study 22 it's pretty narrow 20 to 43 those are the median values though and you can see the 95% confidence 29 is the median value yeah yep for q4 but you can see the confidence interval then it's 20 to 43 but look at the ggt though yeah you're good ggt is is i'm saying like it's let's see meaning as what i'm saying is as the alt goes up to let's say 29 ggt is skyrocketing it seems it seems like g ggt is a way more sensitive marker but let's see what the table says okay so let's see ir death here we go yep death hr q2 q2 q4 no but look at this the risk of death goes down yeah for q2 and q3 but q4 q4 goes up that's right and that was the one where it was 29 for a and i think what 27 for alt so let's see q2 and q q3 have the lowest death that means q2 is 18 to 22 okay so the lower okay so the lower portion is good the lower number that we have the lower optimal range we have 17 which i guess makes sense and then same thing for a yep q gt dose response lowest is best this is it's dose response for ggt yep whereas a and alt are u-shaped curv yep or more like j-shaped yeah i guess it's we're not seeing people who are significantly low it's it's it's a u-shaped curve they must be filtering out people who are on the ends adjusted it's got the adjusted for age sex bmi smoking alcohol it's a lot of conditions no i'm just saying that if they're taking they have to have been filtering out people who had higher levels than 40 which is going to be quite a significant number of people and lower levels of than 17 so the 15 so in the quart tiles it gives you the the 12 to 20 the interquartile range which tells you that where is it let me go to it so you can address that right 24 for a so 25% of the population had higher levels than 35 and 25% had higher than 43 for al so that's 4 million people or or in that group so it's like 1 million people had a or alt greater than 35 and 43 for a and alt okay because you got ggt is interesting so my ggt would be in q1 that's good and and i actually find it yeah i find it to be a pretty sensitive marker the alt and as yeah it could be some supplement or bring it up by by 10 points or something yeah or something in my diet yeah it could be anything right i don't know what it would but i see that same pattern in brian's data too in the low 30s and it's i i don't know which supplements or it's the cumulative because your liver the liver is going to detoxify right so and for me it's if the is the supplement making liver markers worse but eight other biomarkers better that's i'll take that gamble right win eight and lose one i'll take that risk it's so it's just 16 million people hard to argue with that data yeah so based on this like you mentioned so the lowest is going to be q2 and q3 for both of this for alt and a and that means that the number is going to be what was that number again 18 it was 18 to 18 to 22 median values for alt and then 21 to 23 for a so those would be the targets right but where it gets a little bit tricky is when you look at the iqr right the interquartile range so for q4 for as you can see it's from 22 to 35 with the median value of 27 so technically you could be in q4 with a 22 right and that 22 could also put you in q3 it could also put you in the iqr so the it's so that's the interquartile range right so that means that 25% of that of the q4 had values below 20 and then 20 25% of q4 so 1 million people basically wouldn't they but then wouldn't they be in q1 if they had below 20 so the lowest end of the iqr for q1 q2 q3 q4 you can see it goes from alt the lowest end is 12 then it's 14 then it's 16 then it's 20 so the you can see that the range shifts so each of these quartiles has a range right the median being so alt the median being 15 but then you have the inter quart range you can break it down for so like q1 for the lower end of that range 20 of 12 1 million people had alt less than 12 1 million people had 12 to 15 and then 15 to 20 one million people and then 1 million people had 20 or 15 to 20 so you can use that same but where it gets tricky is there is some overlap between the quartiles so that's why i was saying the median target like shooting for the median i think is the reasonable approach why i don't understand they generally don't do this they usually do it where each quartile is a discrete segment should be yeah i don't know why it's a little confusing it's weird how they're doing this is because you could if you're let's say number 20 you could be anywhere from the q1 or q4 depending on yeah you can see that in q4 there's a range of 20 to 43 and then q1 there a range of 12 to 20 i don't understand but from their though with the q1 to q4 bas you can see that the iqrs increase right the r the the it's not just 15 to 18 to 22 to 29 you can see it goes from 12 to 20 to 14 to 24 it's increasing with so it basically shows that when you get to q4 if your alt or a is increasing over time you're going in the wrong direction right so but i that's a fair point some of the data does overlap so it makes it a little bit confusing in terms of interpretation if you only have one test yeah but you've got a mix you've got a mix of data where a little bit in the 30s and a little bit in the 20s all i'm saying is the target should probably be lower i haven't measured my sperm count total testosterone last test was 896 okay i don't think that'll be an issue for me 896 that's pretty good and that's naturally like that natural no trt all just all natural and what's your workout regimen whole body compound movements a mix of calisthenics weightlifting mobility flexibity you're on like you're on the peter aa train in that regard no definitely not he trains way more than me he's got these arbitrary standards of zone two for everything and if you can't do a farmers walk carrying whatever it's nonsense it's other the other thing too i guess i'll put put him on blast his book is basically eat real food and exercise but i won't tell you which diet is best take a statin that's basically what it is eat real food exercise and take a statin that's also that's not an advancement to me so right my approach is the precision nutrition how can we use the biomarkers to guide what what's the best diet at the individual levels okay what and your cholesterol is what total cholesterol is about 150 generally i can tell you the averages but it's probably around 80 to 85 average and did it ever go up what was the highest so when i was eating the high higher saturated fats fat it was a lot of coconut butter i got it up to0 i could it's it's very malleable was 180 oh sorry total cholesterol so ldl was like 120ish somewhere in that range so my highest was like two 230 ldl ah so where it differentiates is that high fiber diets have been shown to reduce ldl so i'm eating 85 grams of fiber per day right now which most people probably don't do i'm guessing you don't get no so i went i did an experiment where i ate tons of fiber like tons five grams no other no no other ones oh that including resistant starch whole foods everything salads supplemental fibers that are supposed to reduce your cholesterol like glucomin all fibers really celium husk resistant starch helps a little bit like they all help a little bit no like it it maybe help 10% but i also think that was one of the doors lowering thyroid hormones i was taking one for example glucomin and that lowers thyroid hormones and glucomin propolis carnitine and and nys i had to either get rid of or the nys i i reduced it oh one other thing i got so bloated eating so much fiber like i it was nuts so that it depends on which vegetables too because i was eating at one point a th000 grams of broccoli per day and i had that problem but so i don't do 1,000 grams of broccoli anymore but i have titrated the fiber down because there is an upper limit in my case but in terms of bloating i don't have that problem generally but in terms of fullness nothing else i'm a volume eater i've got like competitive eater dna so if i'm not eating big volumes of food it's hard to be satiated okay so you're you don't get gas from eating tons of fiber generally not nope which i don't know there is some data linking like gas with short chain fatty acid production which i want to have a lot of the short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate so i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing my soluble fiber levels are like are intake is like 5x the standard american diet so i can't imagine it would be bad mine was all mine was like really i was trying to really loaded on for to reduce my ldl cholesterol for shore shain fatty acids for a bunch of reasons to reduce the actually indox sulfate one of the things you mentioned um and and just other kidney ureic toxins and just bunch of different stuff i also try to get my ua down because my ua is always high i think i may have figured out why and so i'm doing more experiments now but wait what so what's your hypothesis because i i can tell you probably exactly what it is but let's see there's a very clear reason eating too much protein is gonna increase uo assuming assuming normal kidney function because kidney function is if kidney function is getting worse during aging even with this uh the same amount of protein ura will increase so here's an interesting thing did you see that new study with the biological aging using the uk biobank that was more predictive than the feno age do you meaned than le wait do you mean wait which let me find that study you know the l study with the pheno ag right yeah of i use it i use it every blood test this is a new one by the way october 26 2023 if you haven't seen it not but it says they they compared it to feno agage model and they have a 11% increase in predictive value all wait i think i did see this so if you look at the c index or the area under the curve it's very close to feno ag not that i'm saying feno wage is the best but it's not like a 20% better they say 11% better so wait so so biological age clocks are indeed a part of my approach but that that too is like the quick and dirty and that's like the cutesy number but they have blind spots like for example pheno doesn't include blood pressure increases during ages every test has blind spots right there's no question about it that's why i was saying before i agree with you by the way there we don't have to go through every blind spot of the feno age because obviously they're not testing blood pressure they're not testing a million other things right it's actually just like simple cbc with a crp or something right yeah yep i'm curious what markers that they've uh their yeah so that's what i want to show you some of the markers that are interesting and because it's actually relevant to what we're discussing now here it is so we're actually going to integrate a biological aging test and because this is more predictive we were going to go with this one instead of the pheno age aha but it's basically just going to take all of your mark if you have them tested already would just give you your biological age and if you don't you could get the tests buy the test or whatever but you could see which ones are bad so statin means it's increasing your risk the higher it is okay yep and one of the reasons why i'm not worried about my kidney function is because my sytin when i take supplements my statin c actually goes down and when i don't it goes up meaning like when i'm taking less supplements it actually goes up i i think that i know which supplements i think like the stuff that's good for kidney function i think makes it go down but a quick point so stat and see was that besides age and sex was the the highest predictor of biological one the one yeah that's what it showed right we'll go back to that in a second i just want to show you my catin c here yeah okay you could see there was 0.69 this is without with less supplements and you could see it's going down and then it went down to 0.6 0.61 wait so what happened for that one milligram per liter oh i this is when i this is the last time i got sick this is an infection yeah i was on the red eye ah so actually this was before the red eye um this was i actually got good night's sleep this night but my body was fighting infection i didn't know it so i think what would have happened normally is if i was living a good lifestyle not and i slept that night i probably would have fought it off and what happened is because i didn't go to sleep that night and my body was already fighting the infection i got sick and so there was a lot of markers that came back weird after this one that would indicate that i was sick do you track i see a lot of data but do you track it do you take the average for your year you know for s staty and everything else and then track that over time because the staty increases during aging so you want to make sure not just that it's low 6.7 but you want to make sure it doesn't go from 6 65 75 i haven't been tracking it for too long so the first time i took the test was 0.69 and that was five years ago around almost and i've gotten older and it's gone down going in the right direction y now so suany was actually the number one test they have here right red blood cell the rdw was number two gamma ggt was number three and like i said my ggt was good so if you actually look at all the tests they use here they actually don't use even the lt and a number one yeah use that to predict like in this test actually all like this my biological age is going to come down like quite significantly from this test because it happens to be that the markers that they're using here are the mar markers that i'm quite strong with and in this case ura it actually shows an anti-aging effect like having so if you see having higher blue indicates that higher levels reduce mortality hazard yeah i can explain why that is and creatinine as well look at this so ura creatin which typically come up a little higher for me um like you said creatin is proportional to muscle mass muscle mass declines towards end of life so lower muscle mass lower creatinine so that's probably one reason why people who had higher creatinine or higher muscle mass higher creatinine probably there was reduced biological age ura what's interesting about ura is that it increases during aging but then in terms of all cause mortality risk it can be u-shaped so then how does that make sense where it increases during aging but then mortality risk is u-shaped right right it should be it just pretty much increases just like the aging data but ura is produced by the liver liver function also declines towards end of life you could have deficits people who are very sick comorbidities with liver dysfunction you could have very low levels of ura productions to have low levels of ura in blood so that's how i would explain that one there i wouldn't go too high on ura 2 though because that can mess up the gut could be my ura always tends to be high but you could see it's like low usually yeah that's protein intake you got a lot it's protein intake i eat a i take in a lot of protein right what's your crp what's your crp usually it's pretty low so it's the hs crp it ranges uh but it's here it's 0. 2.25 it's under one higher protein higher ura ura can actually degrade tight junctions intestinal tight junctions making it easier for stuff to leak into the blood activate the immune system hscrp which could be interesting yeah and i can send you all the data for everything i just said all the papers but so that that could be one of the reasons why you know fighting off infections a few times and i get the li the traveling lifestyle as a challenge and you're out everywhere and doing all the things and i get that it could be a challenge to keep crp low but it could be as simple as just so for example protein intake stu phillips they've done meta analyses on what's the maximum amount of protein intake that maximiz muscle gains as a result of strength training regular strength training and it's 1.6 grams per kilogram so i wouldn't go above that if you can cut your protein intake to 1.6 grams per kilogram i think i have like two i'm pretty sure i have maybe let's see i'm 80 kilos yeah so 128 kilos if it was two them would be 160 you're saying i should consume like 128 i probably honestly i don't know it's hard to know exactly how much i consume like i could only know from the powders that i take but i'm still deficient in certain amino acids which is why i started supplementing with digestive enzymes so if you look at certain amino acids i'm low on them like cadine i was low on arginine for example and histadine histadine is a big one that's been shown to be associated with reduced all cause mortality risk and it declines during aging so look so it was here and you see it jump because supplemented with hine oh yeah so i tested it twice to make sure that it's not a fluke and it actually was lower the second time and then i was like okay let me and i actually felt like a really good effect from it that also is an indication that i was deficient do you have ergo do you have ergine in in your data no i don't test for that but i do supplement with it erging is a big one it declines during aging you know this stuff on cognitive function but i think supplementing with it may not be the best approach because so it can be the question is why would it decline during aging and it's actually it can actually be degraded by gut bacteria there long story short i got a long story short this right gut gut bacterial ph of the gut becomes more alkaline which is a bad thing because when the gut ph becomes more alkaline that enables potentially pathogenic bacteria like in terab bacteria to bloom which are they contain genes that can produce indoxyl sulfate paracrystal sulfate the short chains acidify the colon which help keep inter inab bacteria low so anyway centenarians for example have a ph a gut ph of eight and their ergine levels are generally pretty low the long story short there is ergine can be degraded by gut bacteria and the ergo ergo gene is maximally active at a alkaline ph in other words aging more alkaline gut ph more ergine degradation and you know what it's converted into trimethylamine so increased tma which potentially bad for the kidney potentially bad for cardiovascular disease all because of the gut so yeah iolo's kit doesn't measure ergine either i'm trying to get them to measure that i i think it's a big one and i i should say too i've got insider info we're looking at centenarian data uh long life family study and and and another one and we see the ergine in tmao ratio centenarians have a a longer survival versus shorter survival the shorter survival being have a lower ratio meaning less erine more tmo versus the ones that have higher erine and lower tmo so i think that's a big one i'm actually going to go after that in a grant for parkinson's uh disease and see if i can flip that ratio supplement with it you're saying because ah so the reason i don't know if that's the best approach is sure you'll increase circulating levels because when you eat it it'll get absorbed through the small intestine but if any of that gets to the colon then you've got it being degraded by gut bacteria into tma which potentially may be shooting yourself in the foot at the same time that may be why some of the rcts that have used erging didn't see an effect on like cognitive function i felt the good cognitive function when i first started it i don't now it's just part of my protocol so you're young right so you're gut ph probably more acidic than someone who's a lot older whereas for them maybe it's more important to work on acidifying the colon whether through its fiber or polyphenols or whatever can best do it what is your ura let's say that you consistently 10 10 interesting 10 but my protein intake is uh 100 grams per day so like 1.4 1.5 grams per kilogram i'm trying to stay within that 1.6 window okay interesting but like i said this is saying this is saying uria actually having higher levels can help again this is a little different than certain data depends on with these biological clocks it's it's not u-shaped it's if you're it's unidirectional if you're in this direction it increases your age or decreases your age right so they probably had some segment of the population that was end of life where lower levels of ura you could find that's the rare exception i can imagine knowing that it increases during aging except for the end of life where poor kidney function can't make ura because ura is made in the liver sorry poor liver function so in that case i can see how like i said the u-shaped association for all cause mortality risk so the too low would be at advanced age it could be technically i'd be on the i technically i'd be on the increased slope for all cause mortality risk but low levels are found in youth so so that that's a big part of this too joe is the nuance right for example too most of the ldl story where in terms of all cause mortalit with ldl most of the models haven't adjusted for comorbidities or all of them there's a study that just came out with 5 million veterans where they adjusted for i don't know 11 morbidities are 14 something a lot and uh the the increase because ldl all cause mortality ris can be j-shaped or u-shaped and that's why a lot of the high ldl people have been like yeah look if you're at low ldl it's bad for you higher is better or relatively higher but when they adjusted for comorbidities because ldl declines towards end of life all cause mortality risk wasn't significant anymore at the lower levels it was only above 200 where ld or a total cholesterol of 200 and higher ldl is a part of that where um all cause more mortality risk increase so in other words adjusting the models for as many comorbidities as possible seems to be a limitation in understanding the nuance behind a lot of these biomarkers and most studies unfortunately aren't adjusting for literally every comorbidity liver function lung function kidney it's mostly like hypertension metabolic health bmi age sex they're leaving other stuff on the table interesting also they show cholesterol having higher cholesterol indicates lower mortality risk so that might be with the you mentioned yeah end of life it so cholesterol total cholesterol starts off low in youth peaks at around 50 to 60 years and then comes down end of life so if you're if you're low as a 20-year-old or you have relatively low as 110 year old how would you know the difference both of them would technically look look youthful but i'm guessing that for the people that in their study lower was on that slope for end of life i for me the nuance is if your cholesterol total cholesterol is low and albumin is low and hdl is low that's the aged phenotype but if you've got low total cholesterol high albumin high hdl or relatively high hdl 50 55 60 whatever then you probably got youthful phenotype so they're actually they also show as you would expect albumin and apoa that they higher apoa is would be a serate for hdl so should be and apoa as the higher those are the lower mortality and then like i said they included they got uria here they got creatinin creatin is actually the most significant one yeah high the lower mortality and then number two by the way was alt ah look at that interesting they showed that as number two so creatinin in terms of effect size it seems like creatinin higher creatinin was associated with lower mortality and i'm assuming they're excluding kidney people with kidney disease right i don't know maybe not maybe not even if catin c is not muscle mass is proportional to creatinine that's one reason for the use of catin c it's less responsive to changes in muscle mass so that higher cattin c increases during aging worse kidney function for sure but knowing that muscle mass can be or is proportional to creatinine like i said to me that's a higher muscle mass younger biological age but if your systa andc is high worse kidney function older biological age what's your body fat my body fat was i think it was 15% same 14.9 which is crazy interesting what's up with the so i guess there's some controversy there because when i looked at what's the optimal fat mass for lowest mortality you actually see something like 25% yeah so what's interesting about that is i have an idea on this so actually it was in my book not that i'm trying to plug that but so immune function the cin microbial burden just if anybody looks up my name on amazon they'll see it but so immune function declines during aging and fat adipocytes they actually produce uh coccion which is an antimicrobial peptide so i can see that for people who uh aren't lean for the duration of their lifespan and have declining immune function that there's an expansion of fat mass which is known fat mass increases during aging and that may be that expansion of fat mass may be a compensatory mechanism to adjust for the immuno decline during aging so in that case you would see but you don't have an appropriate control group like what about people who've been lean and fit in every way not just metabolically but no immune cell or functional decline has that been con compared against people who have a bmi of 28 and 20 25 or whatever the lowest all caed mortality or is which is outrageous 22 something higher than 15 that control group doesn't exist because people like you and me with relatively leaning body fats this is the exception to the rule not the rule right there's some of them that are clear and some of them are probably less clear there's a lot of variables some of them i think are causal some of them are clearly not right so it's if you're very sick you're eating less you're gonna be you're gna weigh less yeah but also if you're when you're older you're more prone to falls if you have no fat or muscle on you you're just to start breaking yeah that's why i train i train all that stuff mobility balance i'm not trying to my bone density was i don't know i look i haven't looked up like the publish studies i only go by what the dex showed so i'm at like the the upper limit for bone density like at the bottom of the upper limit so my bone density is pretty good for okay i'm not worried about breaking some for yeah for any chronological age even the youngest the 20 i'm still in that group but so if my bone density was low i'd be worried about breaking something okay yeah i see what you're saying i guess my concern is with the the whole fat percentage that okay one thing if i don't have to be in let's say i think 25% is too much i actually think 15% is probably optimal but the concern is is that you don't want to go till eight or nine so interestingly i measured dexa last year different machine older machine machine 12.9% i this year newer machine paid for it last year i got it for free at toughs 14.9% and i'm 10 pounds leaner no loss in strength no loss in function i see abs in the mirror like i pretty close to ripped so how many calories are you eating a day what you're doing a 10% calorie restriction no so if you go by so because i've tracked diet since 2015 food scale and everything i know exactly the magnitude of cr at my highest since 2015 2800 calories currently 289 so about 2100 so that's about a 25% cr over over the yeah and i didn't do i didn't just jump into that i've been making very small cuts for every blood test for every two month or seven week period so that's been like an evolution over about three years very slowly cutting over time they go from 2,800 it i've tried very big calorie cuts and just binged it back on in two weeks so fortunately that hasn't been been the case so did you have any amino acids lower when you did the test so i do have the metabolic data but it's i think the amino they have ranges i'm not low in any of them but even determining what's low there is so tricky because all cause mortality data aside from histadine and searing there's so little quantified data it's more untargeted metabolomics you know what i mean where it's they don't give you the actual concentration they just say one group at higher than the other based on the met kit i use i'm not low it's hard to say what exactly is optimal i think for the amino acids what do you know about sering like serum serin so there is data all cause mortality data showing higher levels associated with lower all cause mortality risk and it declines during aging too yeah optim for me i've supplemented with it i'm not sure yet if that increases it i have to analyze that data but that actually might be one where it's easy to increase for me i'm not sure do you supplement with it i do yeah but see for me it's for me it's a more of why would it be low and how can i fix that mechanism that's why i just haven't gone to the supplement road because i haven't fixed anything i'm just trying to band-aid on top of it without getting to the underlying have you ever done a biomarker versus biomarker correlation in your data to see if it's that' be because you have a lot of data you could technically do that to see if phosphorus correlates with creatinines to staten c yeah i might do that at some point that's a good idea to do it at some point i feel like right now there's enough to look at it and get like a general like i take notes about what i was doing and then i'll look at it and be like what was what was i doing differently and trying to just get some picture of that yeah i'm trying to get the lowest hanging fruit and then i could go deeper do more testing further like i'm not even at the point where i'm gonna i'm just getting to the point where i'm going to do the organic acids testing and i'm going to also get into metabolomics as well i feel like there's some room there but again that's advanced stuff right you want to make sure you've got these things down these are more important phosphorus than something esoteric some metabolic product or something right poent potentially right it's just more studied it's more studied but that's the idea is that it's more studied so you're probably at least you know it's more relevant rather than if you change something in your metabone that is not as well studied you might even be harming yourself whereas there's some correlation that it might be good but actually it's not yeah and acetal glucosamine i don't know i don't know if that thing is good or not like i saw some studies that higher serum levels was not good i was just trying it out again for the tendons i don't think i don't know if it helped at all but i'm experimenting do you know anything about that no so when it comes to the tendons and ligaments are you familiar with the knees over to knees over toes approach that whole his whole are you familiar with that no i do in my left knee but that's been going on from like heavy squats for like decades so it hasn't gotten worse and i may be making it better but i'm not sure that any supplement would help with for me i don't know that any supplement with help but you can actually train like your ligaments and tendons by stressing them by putting them in positions where they'd have to get stronger right it's like full range of motion squats and deadlifts and lunges so i try to have as close to strength through a full range of motion as possible which is helped with for me for like knee joints like the actual joints feeling good so i don't have any issues with joints or ligaments and tendons interesting yeah yeah for me i think there's some of those issues are somewhat genetic like some family members have tendon issues as well but yeah i but i think it seems that they've basically like my approach is try to do as much as you can with supplements and then once you're whatever's then you could go to like me i don't it's just my personal approach then go to like physical therapy or do things like whatever you can't improve at that point i'm still at a point where i'm making improvements and i i think i i might not need any physical therapy so i i think yeah meaning based on my newest experiments with the higher dosages of a nostal i don't think i need to do the physical therap even though i'm sure it'll help but it's just more timec consuming i'd rather figure it out from the supplement approach first like i the first thing i do is go to supplements so i've physical therapy i've tried it before and i found it completely useless for me yeah because they're just they're doing the basics it's not uh i' look into help a lot of people like when you i just ask people they're like yeah it helped me a lot so there's only so much in terms of range of motion that the joints can move through right so it's something i don't know the the knees over toes approach for at least for my knees my left knee in particular i can see and feel a difference uh by actually training the joints you know what squats are where you put a lot of pressure on the knees it's almost like a lean forward kind of squat you're on your tippy toes it purposely stresses the knee joint and that's going to affect the ligaments and tendons which should increase blood flow there which blood flow there is already limited so i wasn't doing any of that in the past so for me i think that's going to have the biggest benefit versus a supplement maybe if i if it was lacking the precursors to build some of that but i'm not sure that i you never tried it you never tried it that's true that's true but ied the supplement approach that not yet not yet but for now directly stressing it feels pretty feels pretty good no range of motion limitations so i do have a herniated disc in my back that i've been dealing with for like decades that i've got to be really careful though from what where heavy squats and deadlifts heavy squats and eagle lifting in my 20s like an idiot what was i even cleaning jerks i was trying to do i was doing cleaning jerks like 200 pounds just like a mad man in my 20s what was the most you've ever weighed one close to 180 oh wow so you were like a muscle yeah yep protein powders protein bars all that back in the day yeah i weaned off it i weaned off it so why because it's too much no i just try to for whatever reason my body responds best on whole food um for now and uh yeah whey whey isopure whey protein powder it was usually way how what makes you think like what when you're doing the nle foods what is worse i wouldn't say it's worse i just get more nutrient density and i don't it's like the unknown of okay sure i could get 40 grams of whey but that 160 calories i could also get maybe a little bit less protein but a whole bunch of other nutrition that i'm not getting so interesting okay and you don't get like exploded you don't have any other problems from no but i did it's just you know evolving it to the point where i know how much of which of the foods trigger some of that stuff right like the broccoli like keeping that relatively low you eat a lot of whole grains no not a lot at all it's less than 60 grams per day which is far less than and actually i cut whole grains completely out but once i saw the fat correlations in my data i was like where am i going to get the calories it can't be more fruit exactly not more protein either got to add some whole grain what about beans how much you got the chickpeas in there what else chick just to chickpeas those because i have food sensitivity too i've done the ig and it's crazy because like kidney beans l pinto beans it's like a whole bunch of them that i've eaten a lot of in the past like you're saying i'd get the bloating pain all that stuff chickpeas no basically no problem oh interesting okay so you're saying that you it's not like you you don't if you eat the wrong things you will get bloating yeah yep um okay so you're on a somewhat of a paleo diet if you will right not too not much grains not much beans fish every day meat yeah no not that often but i'm not opposed to it it's just the fish sardines i so i'll tell you something when i eat a lot of fish it harms my cognitive function it harms your cognitive function wow because of because i know why basically i take activated charcoal and it goes away so it's the there's like fat-based there fat soluble toxins like the dioxins in fish that activated charcoal seems to bind to that give me problems if i eat too much fish so for me it's only the 100 grams per day i don't know how much what's the how much fish is too much for you was oh no i was eating like like a 500 grams day oh wow yeah so that's for me 100 grams no problem but no for the it was i get the omega-3s i don't get that from meat it's more satiating for me i like meat i like eggs are okay too you know what's your main protein source fish it's the sardines so today was uh 2150 workout day today so uh calorie intake a little bit higher than usual but all right let's see protein 113 grams of protein today 41 i had two sardines so 41.6 sardines chickpeas 13 collards 10 mushrooms nine actually mushrooms twice take you to measure all these things in a day it takes a little bit of time but i enjoy it it's a hobby right i've gotten from people in the past yeah why do you do that but i don't feel right if i'm not actually weighing everything and quant it just doesn't feel right what's you got to be quantifying it are you still at tough doing research or yeah yeah yep are still a tough yeah what are you doing there for now i have a human study which is a high soluble fiber diet versus the usda guidelines on the potential effect on muscle gut muscle axis can we improve muscle mass and physical function if we forx your soluble fiber intake from a whole food based diet it's basically the mic diet okay in older adults older adults so this a clinical trial yep randomized control trial how many people three people have finished we've got it's going to be 24 people it's not that much three have finished okay we've got six enrolled in january the next few months we should be ramping up okay do you also teach there or no occasionally class here and there but okay research you teach on the last class i did was a a month or two ago it was gut gut muscle axis impact of diet on the gut muscle axis two-hour presentation guest host spot impact of diet on the gut muscle axis okay that was actually one of the paper the review papers i saw so so i've actually done that high soluble fiber diet in mice aged mice to do to test the same effect and yeah no major it's crazy because if you look at we it was females and males we tripled the soluble fiber content just whole food and so it was nine like 17 mice which isn't a lot but they're genetically homogeneous so that's a decently powered study high soluble fiber diet as a whole group no difference in terms of muscle mass grip strength or treadmill endurance capacity so it basically it doesn't impact solal fiber doesn't impact up muscle axis 3x in it but all of the high fiber mice high soble fiber mice got lean they lost a ton of body fat and it gets where it gets even more interesting is the female mice ate the same amount of food as the controls lost weight had better treadmill endurance capacity which does suggest a role for gut muscle but only in the female mice the male mice actually ended up eating more calories on the high cop fiber diet but didn't have didn't have an impact on muscle no no improvement in muscle strength or muscle mass so only in the females only in the females but both the males and females lost a ton of fat mass improving body composition on the high soluble fiber diets and this is the animals have to eat exactly lost fat mass but only the females increased muscle mass it didn't increase muscle mass but improved the treadmill how far they could run on the treadmill and ate the same amount of yeah i don't know that i don't know are know and they eat their own poop which is even worse yeah so how do you measure how it's a confounding variable who's eating their own poop they all eat their own poop it's a limit and the cr mice especial they're they're eating everything they can find in their cage that's why i don't know if you watch rick and morty do you watch rick and morty no there's a doctor and they make a joke that she's the therapist and on her door it's the coasia she's a coasia doctor which is basically the eating doctor anyway that's a joke yeah oh my gosh the mice are copper yeah they eat their own they eat their own po gosh yeah oh my gosh so what about the best fiber for butyrate is resistant starch the best is that the best fiber so i don't know the answer i don't think anybody knows the answer to that so it depends on your gut microbiome because if you don't have the fiber degrading bacteria you probably won't make it right so then and then it's not just one bacterium it's probably a whole group so you'd have to and then a whole group of bacteria working together because they can cross feed so you could have acetate producers and not have the butyrate producers and have high acetate but have low butyrate i used to think it was super easy just increased soluble fiber but and but then which one so many factors which h how what percentage of people do you think have bacteria to produce butyrate from resistant starch or soluble fiber probably everybody but it's a matter of do you have all of the bacteria do you have and and yeah yeah and then which fiber do you respond best to resistance starch pectin there are so many different fiber types arabino xylan beta glucan there's so many damn inulin just from my own experiments i've megga doed each of these fibers to the max of capacity where i'm like i start really getting like serious gut issues the only one that i could notice was really having that berate effect was the resistance tarch but wait berate effect but did you measure no i'm just it's based on a subjective feeling so i feel when it hits me about 10 to 12 hours later and i think it peaks at probably 16 hours later whatever but basically like i feel it it hits me how does it feel what's the feel it feels it's certain this it's like a sharpness it's more relaxed more focused it's it i it has similar effects to when you take a butter supplement like a large dosage but it has that effect over a continuous amount of time personally i'm convinced when it hits right you could always argue that it's place whatever but i'm convinced that it's a real effect meaning it's beyond what i would consider a placebo effect so that at a certain point if it's strong enough for you then you realize hey this is not a placebo where it always could be but i've taken it a thousand times at this point and there's it's a very consistent effect even though even if i take it every day i could still feel it and yeah and i find that like 40 grams of resistant starch like i actually sell the product it's called joe's resistance star but i found 40 grams of that is is the amount where i don't get the gastrointestinal effects like i don't get any gas or anything like that and i feel the butter rate so it's like a high enough dosage where i feel it and i've taken 120 grams of it a day and it's like super strong no it's like really strong like it's too strong so that's how i know it's having i i i know it's having the impact and then the qu and it even uh ruins my sleep i can't sleep if it's too high of a dosage right mate also is like you you want it to be in a certain range you don't want to have too high levels but so i find like the perfect dosage for me is like around 40 grams a day and that's not too strong it's great and i try to time it i don't i used to take it in the morning but then it was i think as i increased my motility also things changed like i used to have much slower motility and so the timing was different it was like used to be 18 hours and and and it moved till 10 to 12 and it should be 10 to 12 for a healthy gut because that's the time it takes to reach your large intestine so yeah it's based on my experience based on the research that i've seen and and based on i've taken every fiber out there in mega doing quantities so i butter rate's a good one but see i'm more interested in the gut ph like luminal ph feal ph so butyrate even though butyrate is important especially gut muscle axis or gut adapost axis gut brain axis it compared to acetate in the gut it's i don't know the magnitude of the the difference but acet is far higher than butyrate so my interest would be how do you acidify best acidify the colon i don't know maybe that's an experiment to do where you take your poop ph i don't know if you can just dip a so i i'll tell you something yeah when i take too high dosages of the resistant starch i'm talking about like a 100 over 100 grams it it some it actually hurts my large intes like i feel some pain there and i think it's because it's too acidic like i feel like it's too acidic it just has that kind of feeling where it's like burning a little bit almost right and and it's because it's too much butyrate that's what i'm saying like i've done these experiments i've done over 10 years not just butter it's going to be they're going to ferment it it's going to be acetate propionate berate probably even valerate the c5 it could be but i find that the resistant starch really turns into toate more and i guess it depends on which one the one that we have is it's derived from corn and it seems to work really well in converting to berate just butyrate so the other fibers seem to do random meaning like it seems to i don't have any like signif too sign significant effect on berate it seems to probably be more broadly like acetate proprionate increase acetate and proprionate but the resistance starch that i take it seems pretty uh focused on berate from from again i could be wrong i don't know if it's not creating aate i just think it's focused yeah the gut ph thing that's the thing i'd be interested in the most if the resistance starch so inulin in the publ re in your case maybe resistance starch is better at acidifying the colon but not going to 120 grams but in the publish published research inulin seems to be the best at reducing it but like i said the problem is you can't take two al let's say mega with inulin is 10 15 grams and all of a sudden it's like holy crap it's like i'm bloated as hell i'm farting not just that there's there's published data that it increases liver enzymes in certain people at very high doses 30 grams per day so obviously you'd want to avoid that too so i i think it depends yeah it's for me i the the only the best fiber by far is resistance starch and yeah it seems like actually like a lot of my labs are uh even better when when i'm eating less fiber meaning like more resistant starch and and not as much just general fibers yeah that's what i do now so i actually i'm doing an experiment where so i went on the high fiber diet like super high i was taking like every fiber on the market like all these things and then i was like okay this not working now i'm just focusing on the resistance starch yeah i don't take in any other fibers and then i take nutritional which has better glucan so that's and then just certain things that have fiber in general i'm not eating much salad i'm trying to see a little bit i used to eat like loads of broccoli and salad i was like again when i was eating lower amounts my actually there were certain things that improved including my biological age again you got to look at these things in context but what else is there yeah so i'm doing that experiment to see what happens because i feel like in order for me to get in enough protein i can't without being too bloated i can't eat too much fiber this there's limits and so if i'm taking 40 grams of the resistance starch it's 40 grams but it's actually only 60% resistance like resistance stars so what is that it's 6 24 24 yeah 24 g so that's 24 gr of resist that's 24 g of solid fiber just from that and then for i'm taking 40 grams of brewers yeast on a lot of days so that's probably half fiers i don't know at least a lot probably half and yeah just from those two i'm getting a lot of pretty you know decent amount of fiber yeah so your fiber in your soluble fiber intake probably higher than mine even on 85 grams of total fiber per day yo i wonder if that's the reason for the biological age so oh part of it obviously not all no but i used to be on i'm telling you i used to be on like 100 over a 100 grams for sure i don't know exact i think it was probably like 150 because i was every meal i had either like large amounts of broccoli and salad and then i supplemental fibers i was having like 100 grams a day i'm going to look into the ura cycle some more there's got to be more inputs than just arginine and ornithine i can't think of any other all all directions point to the liver if it's going to be made the liver and it's higher than it should be with normal kidney function the question is why would you be making more of it why would the liver be making more of it right i don't i don't know honestly i don't know i don't know yeah i want to get it down because of the mortality studies but then on the other hand this new study shows that ura has higher ura could even lower mortality so it's i don't know what to make of this anymore so so uk biobank has a pretty good study 500,000 people showing the u shap apap association for blood ua nitrogen and if i remember off the top of my head i think 16 was the lowest portion of the u so yeah i gotta find this study for you now hang on yeah go for it yeah 17 17 it's here i'll get i'll get you this this is an easy one lowest mortality at 17 yeah yeah that's one portion of this paper they had two they had a longer study and a shorter study the study with the shorter followup it was 17 but wait i got to look at the other one all right so it's in this paper here this paper is a gold mine for optimal ranges for cbc stuff so they had a small they had a in this study there was a cohort of 19,000 people who were followed for 31 years higher levels of bun were not associated with all cause mortality so smaller sample size but a longer followup but then when they had a 425,000 people uh study that had a shorter followup yeah 177 was lowest risk uhhuh but when you look at the all cause mortality data for the smaller sample size and the longer follow-up it's right at that border of of uh that hazard being higher than a hazard ratio of one for all values above 16 see this is a good one i like this study yeah interesting the uric acid here seems to be dose dependently higher the worse whereas there's other other studies that show a u curve four something but wait more more important even based on the biological age study that you posted here is the lymphocytes and because the two of them lite percentage 45 it's always pretty good i think mine is over 50 nice so your lymphocytes are high or your nutrifil and monocytes are very low in order to have the high percentage because if your nutrifil and lymph if nutrifil and monocytes are very low like a thousand for nutrifil and like 400 for monocytes or 300 anyway the that port of the equation should be your absolute lymph here's here's my the lymphocyte absolutes yeah yeah yeah so wait so around 2000 two yeah that's a little bit high but i don't think that's associated with all ca morality risk 2,000 is lowest alca mortality risk man joe i'm gonna have to pull up that data for you because that's another good see here okay please do 2,000 i it looks like i range oh i actually just no i oh i would like to see that because i actually just researched this and it seemed like there i couldn't find any research for three 3 point under 3.7 mean 1.5 to 3.7 okay but i i i would like to see what you got there wait 1.5 to 3.7 for which for what l lymphocytes for this one it's 108,000 people i mean that i don't know how much the i i haven't seen a bigger studies but if you've got bigger studies on lymphocytes yeah sure okay so these are my lymphocytes what else did you want to see nutrifil nutrifil and monoc so wait so you can see in when you look at the lymp monocytes are low yeah but which is a good thing yeah yeah so lymphocytes when you look at the curve you'll see that having low lymphocytes the all cause mortality risk goes up so you're at the right your lymphocytes being relatively high is is on the right side of history because they also decline during aging so all right monocytes low neutrophils what's the what's that absolute number i can't see it's 2.49 so 2,000 to 3,000 is lowest all cause mortality risk so yeah you're good that's around where it is yeah yeah you're good yeah yeah so that's a lymph asy percentage then is good yeah i don't i i i measure total wip blood cells obviously but i don't i pay no attention to that total number because it's more important to look at the neutrophils monocytes and lymphocytes and that [music] lowest all cause mortality risk or sorry increasing all cause mortality risk is when monocytes are less than 250 for cvd mortality so you don't want all your data to be in the hundred hundreds or even less less than 250 um it's 250 to four 250 to 100 for cardiovascular mortality so yeah just for cbd mortality less than 250 would be a flag but that would be your average mono sites being less than 250 if you took the average of all these days it doesn't look like it'd be lower than 250 so i wouldn't pay attention to one test where it's low if it's always low probably red flag so i don't do calorie restriction by the way which calorie restriction is going to bring down your rate of aging should yeah it should that's what their data shows their internal data and it would make sense right but so i don't do that i don't do it on purpose so i just eat to content do you feel hungry ever and you don't eat or so no generally not but so i can always eat like i said i've got competitive eater dna so i'm like 99% satiated eating like this okay so you have to eat like a whole a bunch of like fibrous foods in order to really fill your belly up and yeah yeah but it's stuff but it's stuff i like everything i'm eating is stuff i like there isn't anything here that's just for volume and i don't like it and then i'm forcing myself have the willpower there's none of that do you organic as almost exclusively as much as i can okay does that i'm trying to limit pesticide burden but then even what's organic you could have organic pesticides like rotown is technically an organic pesticide but i'm sure you know it complex one inhibitor mitochondria technically the pesticide burden should be less in terms of nutrient density this i think there was study showing there's no difference conventional versus uh organic i'm saying have you seen any differences in your blood test from conventional organic i didn't properly control it to to see even the eating window so i'm in that i shouldn't say i'm in the brian johnson boat but i've my eating window has been relatively short for a couple of years but not because it impacts yeah but not because it impacts the biomarkers so for me i've been trying to optimize sleep for as long as possible and because of the fruits and vegetables a heavy volume of water that i'm eating in the past i'd wake up every couple hours to pee and i' wake up feeling like terrible so shortening the eating window gives me more time to pee everything or pee out more of it so i wake up at most to pee maybe once twice when i'm finally ready to wake up interesting my eating window is pretty yeah i don't have it's probably like a 12-h hour like it's pretty standard it's not like some people where they're eating right before bed but it's 12 hours so this is interesting because for me the gold standard in life extension studies in mice for example is circadian alignment which is to sleep making sure you get to sleep when the sun goes down not a couple hours later i never do that i know fasting right fasting so cal i know i know probably more than most people most people have a even longer eating window and then cr right so for me that's like the cornerstone uh of the approach any of those i know and your data your the need and pace is better yeah that's the thing thing is i by the way i mean out of those three circadian rhythm i should do and it would be much better for me but i just can't i i don't i'm not in that situation where i can do it right either i'm traveling or there's night life here it's just i can't do it i'd have to live like a hermit if i was gonna do the bri johnson approach i'm just not willing to do that so i have to unless it was like really i was like okay i it's just completely impact my life i can't live then i would be like okay i got to do it but i you know i'm still okay even though i know it's like i'm okay with some damage because the tradeoff right the benefits but that's why i'm saying like i'd rather try to optimize as much as i can with supplements so that i can live a better life in other ways yeah yeah you're doing a pretty good job so yeah for me it's that i burned myself out traveling too much and i've got a few trips scheduled this year and i'm it's going to wreck i know it's going to wreck me for a few days no matter how much i try to quotequote biohacker yeah i know 100% all right cool it was it was been very fun speaking to you and yeah thanks for coming on what was your book again just so people know microbial burden a major cause of aging and age related disease and how to fight back and then the youtube channel where i'm biohacking every week making videos how long do you have the channel on youtube for 2023 three years okay and that's called aging or die trying after aging or die trying okay i like that
