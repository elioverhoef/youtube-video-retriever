# Did Supplementing With Trigonelline Impact NAD?

## Transcript

Trigonelline increases nad in blood liver and muscle but these data are in mice what about in people so to test that for 10 days i supplemented with 500 mig of supplemental trigonelline per day and note that that's a sfold increase above my usual trelian intake from diet my usual intake is around 70 milligram per day so 500 milligram supplemental sfold increase so to find out i sent blood to gfinity for ned analysis if you want to measure your own ned levels discount link in the video's description for a june 28th test ned levels were 17.1 micromolar so unfortunately supplemental trigonelline did not increase nad didn't impact it at all how do we know this so how does this 17.1 micromolar compare against previous tests so now we're going to take a look at 20 tests for ned from early 2023 to 2024 as shown here and at the bottom bottom right we can see the most recent test and then without going through each of the tests i've covered each of these tests in the nad playlist which i'll link in the right corner we can see that 17.1 micromolar is my lowest ned test over all 20 tests so does that mean that there will be no more future trigonelline nad experiments as it seems that at least 500 milligrams of trigonelline supplemental doesn't impact nad so there is one last question to be addressed was plasma trigonelline greater than 7 micromolar and i've used seven micromolar as that cut off because my highest dietary intake uh of trigonelline was able to push plasma trigonelline to 6.9 micromolar so if plasma trigonelline was not higher than 7 micromolar that suggests that 500 mig of supplemental trigonelline wasn't enough to impact plasma levels and if that's the case how if i can't if i don't get an increase in plasma levels of trigonelline is it reasonable to expect that nad shouldn't shouldn't increase either so if that's if that's not true if trigonelline did not push plasma trigonelline to greater than seven micromolar then i'll potentially increase supplemental intake of trelon to 1 gram or more per day but if if plasma trigonelline was greater than seven micromolar that argues against the role for relatively higher intakes of dietary and supplemental trigonelline on impacting nad at least for me maybe it's different for other people i'd encourage others to do that experiment to find out on for the june 28th test i also sent blood for metabolomic analysis using io's kit which includes measurement of of plasma levels of trigonelline so stay tuned for that data uh in an upcoming video as it should be arriving any day now all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with side fox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chron meter or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
