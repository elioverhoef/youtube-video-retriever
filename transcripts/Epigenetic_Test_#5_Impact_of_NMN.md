# Epigenetic Test #5: Impact of NMN?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Epigenetic test number five was there an impact for nmn so first how much nmn for the 42-day period from test number four to test number five average nmn intake was 340 milligrams per day and more specifically i increased that to 1 000 milligrams per day for the seven day period prior to test number five and then which epigenetic tests in this video we'll go through data for dunedin pace horvath and hanum and these data were generated with true diagnostic and if you're interested in measuring your own epigenetic age using these tests there'll be a discount link in the video's description so for test number four dunedin pace was 0.78 horvath was five years older you can see it's in red because that's going in the wrong direction and hannems was 11 years younger in green because it's in the right direction so what about these data for test number five well let's start off with data for dunedin pace so first why dunedin pace what's the importance of this epigenetic test so a younger biological age for people on age 12 percent calorie restricted diet for two years was identified by dunedin pace but not by other epigenetic clocks so let's take a look at that data first starting with the horvath on the left and hannah on the right and the change epigenetic change for horvath on the left and then the epigenetic change for hannah on the right there were three time points baseline 12 months and 24 months on a cr diet in red or in black for people who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted ad lib and then we can see that both horvath and hanum did not identify a epigenetic age reduction for people on cr for up to two years similarly to other gold standard epigenetic tests pheno age and grimage were not able to identify reduced epigenetic age for people on two years of cr the first iteration of dunedin pace dunedin poem pace of aging methylation p-o-a-m that test two was unable to identify an epigenetic age reduction for people on cr but the most recent iteration of dunedin pace is able to detect an epigenetic age reduction for people on cr as we can see they're both at the 12 and 24 month time points people on cr had a younger epigenetic age as identified by dunedin pace so with that in mind what's my data so epic dunedin pace is presented as a speedometer 0.6 on the left will be the slowest epigenetic aging rate and what that means is for that every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years in contrast the fastest epigenetic aging rate would be 1.4 so for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years so for this most recent test on march 6 of 2023 mike dunedin pace value was 0.79 so for context how does this test compare with previous tests well we know for test number four it was 0.78 and because there that's essentially the same no change we can conclude that nmn didn't impact dunedin pace so what the good news though is that these two last data points 0.79 and 0.78 are better than my first three values for dunedin pace you can see 0.89 a2 and eight zero and now that i have data for five epigenetic tests going forward i can invest the correlations with diet to see what may be impacting the nina pays value so stay tuned for that in a future video or videos next up let's take a look at horvath data and see if that improved or not with nmn so horvath's test is also known as intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or iea and it's a marker of cell intrinsic aging it's also strongly correlated with chronological age and that's we can see here so on the y-axis we've got dna and h so dna methylation age or epigenetic age you can see this is the first iteration of the horvath clock horvath1 and then horvath2 on the y-axis for the second on on the right that's the second iteration of this test and on the y-axis the epigenetic age sorry dna methylation is plotted against chronological age on the x and then note that there are many different colored circles on both of these plots that's because this is a multi-tissue clock that includes breasts cheek cells or buccal cells brain cerebellum colon core blood and so on and then we can see strong correlations for epigenetic age with chronological age on the left with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 remember that a perfectly linear correlation is 1.0 so 0.94 is pretty close to that similarly the second iteration of the horvath clock had a correlation coefficient of 0.85 so we can see that horvath's epigenetic clock is strongly correlated with chronological age in fact it's the most strongly correlated with chronological age of all of the epigenetic clocks now for the first four tests my average horvath epigenetic age was 54.9 years which is in red because it's going in the wrong direction and you can see that that's four to seven years older than my chronological age over that four test span so what about for this test now that i've got nmn in the approach so this test horvath epigenetic age was 52.99 years which is still three years older than my chronological age but this is my lowest horvath epigenetic age over these first five tests now a two-year epigenetic age reduction using the horvath test could be caused by nmn or is this just normal variation so next up let's take a look at hanum's epigenetic age to get a little bit more perspective so hannah's epigenetic test is also known as extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or eea and is a marker of immune system aging for test number five my hanum epigenetic age is 42.08 years which is eight years younger than my chronological now superficially eight years younger than chronological age is good news but how does this test compare with previous tests so for the first four tests my hanum epigenetic age was 38.3 years that was the average over those four tests or 10 to 12 years younger than my chronological age over those first four tests so this is actually my worst hand and epigenetic age over the five tests being eight years younger which suggests that maybe nmn maybe made it worse now before concluding that nmn had no effect on dunedin pace made horvath better and hannah worse other variables can affect epigenetic age including diet or physical activity so were these variables different when comparing test 4 with test five so what i then did was looked at the 42-day period that proceeded test number four and then the 42-day period that preceded test number five and compared macro and micronutrients including calories and all the macro micros on the left and then used a two sample t-test between these two groups of data and then what you can see with the p-values is that they're all greater than 0.05 so from that there were no between the test differences for diet including macro and micronutrients and calorie intake well what about average levels average daily levels of physical activity so my fitness tracker provides the average daily heart rate as an index of physical activity and note this isn't the resting heart rate this is the full day average for heart rate and for both test number four and test number five for the 42 day period that preceded each test my average daily heart rate was 55 beats per minute which was not significantly different test versus test so from this we can see that diet and physical activity wasn't different when comparing test number four with test number five now what was different though is was my body weight as i weigh myself every day and it was significantly lower for test number five versus test number four but how that difference would have would improve horvath but make hannah morris and not effect on any pace i don't yet know i'll have to look at the correlations in future videos to see if body weight may be significantly correlated with any of these epigenetic tests so from these data i think it's fair to conclude that there was no effect for nmn in my case maybe it's different for others on epigenetic age especially when donated paste stayed about the same horvath got a little better and hannah got worse so it's a net neutral minus one zero plus one uh so with that in mind i think it's possible that my horvath changes and hannah changes which is normal variation all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check
