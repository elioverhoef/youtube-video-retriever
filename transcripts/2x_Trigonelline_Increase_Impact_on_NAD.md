# 2x Trigonelline Increase: Impact on NAD?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Trigonelline which is otherwise known as one methyl nicotinic acid increases nad levels in mice and if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner but what about in people so this is part four of a video series where i'm trying to increase ned levels by increasing intake of trigonelline rich foods and some of those foods are shown on this list now in the in an earlier video in an earlier video in april we saw that crimson clover seeds have amongst the highest levels of trigel from all the foods on this list including alfalfa which i tried for an earlier experiment and coffee so to test that for an april 1 test i added clover sprouts into the diet at an average of 121 gram per day for 9 days prior to measuring ned levels and in that video we saw that ned was 29.6 micromolar which i rationalized was a potential nad increase because my baseline levels of nad have yet to be higher than 26.6 micromolar without the ned precursors nicotinic acid or nmn so to further test this hypothesis that clover seeds and correspondingly clover clover sprouts could increase nad i further increase clover sprout intake more than doubling it for an april 29th test to an average of 27.1 g per day for 11 days prior to testing so in today's video we'll see did 2x or more than 2 2x increase for clover sprout uh clover sprout intake did that impact nad to test that i sent blood to gfinity for blood intracellular ned analysis and if you want to measure your own ned levels there's a discount link in the video's description so for the april 29th test we can see that ned levels were 19 micromolar and that they're already highlighted in red should indicate that this is definitely not an increase for nad so this finding then raises a few questions first is low dose trigonelline or dietary intake of trigonelline better for ned levels i don't see how it makes sense where 121 g grams of clover sprouts per day and their corresponding trigonelline intake would get a small bump or small potential bump for nad and then doubling that dose for trigonelline would lead to even lower a lower amount of ned that just doesn't make sense maybe there's a a lower amount of trigonelline that may may be optimal for keeping my ned levels at the higher end of their range without ned precursors alternatively it's also possible that 29.6 micromolar is just random variation now the argument against that is after 7 tests without ned precursors nicotinic acid and nmn my baseline range for ned is 18.5 to 26.6 micromolar so if it is random variation that would suggest that that pushing it to 29.6 micromolar may be my range without anyd precursors and that assumes that clover sprouts had nothing to do with impact ac in ned especially when considering this 19 micromolar finding now alternatively although i took out nicotinic acid for the april 1st test for 4 days before measuring nad average nicotinic acid for the onee period prior to that test was 20 milligram per day so it's possible that that relatively small amount impacted nad that just wasn't washed out prior to testing so to account for that for this test nine days prior to testing nad levels i took out nicotinic acid completely and then we see that i've got close to my lowest ned level ever in fact this is my second lowest measurement over 18 tests so does that retire the uh video series for which foods are trigonelline rich as a means for increasing nad well there is one last option and that's coffee and i'm still not sold on doing that experiment yet i'm open to it i'm just not ready to do it yet to do the coffee experiment i'll have to take out green tea in order to stay caffeine neutral i'm a slow caffeine metabol izer so uh stay tuned for that if i include it at some point in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for any quantification epigenetic testing or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with s fox health which includes apb and grimage green te die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
