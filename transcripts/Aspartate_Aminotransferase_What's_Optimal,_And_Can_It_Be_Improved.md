# Aspartate Aminotransferase: What's Optimal, And Can It Be Improved?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In previous videos i've proposed optimal ranges for biomarkers related to various organ systems including egfr in the kidney resting heart rate and heart rate variability for the heart immune cells including neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes red blood cells and many other biomarkers but one tissue that i haven't covered biomarkers for is the liver so with that in mind the focus of today's video is going to be on aspartate amino transferase ast and we're going to see uh we're going to try to identify optimal ranges in terms of health and longevity so first ast again of aspartate amino transferase is a protein that's produced within liver cells but it's also produced within other tissues including skeletal muscle the kidney and heart now although ast isn't found exclusively within the liver it's strongly associated with liver disease and liver cancer as we'll see in a minute now so what does ast do so it converts aspartate and alpha ketoglutarate into glutamate plus oxaloacetate and note that this is a reversible reaction so in the presence of glutamate and oxaloacetate it can then convert that into aspartate and alpha ketoglutarate now this is an intracellular protein so if higher than normal levels are found in the blood for ast it's it reflects cellular damage so the reference range for ast is 0 to 40 iu's international units per liter and that's lab corps reference range so is the reference range for ast optimal for health and longevity so first let's have a look at the aging data so ast is on the y-axis plotted against age starting from 20 year olds all the way up to 85 plus and when starting a youth when looking at the males uh in blue and the females in red we can see that values somewhere around 20 are found in young adults now ast then increases for both men and women up to about 60 years old and then is approximately flat uh staying somewhere uh closer to 30 up until about 85 years of age but what happens older than 85. I'm interested in living longer than that so i want to know what happens to asd at ast at very older ages so to investigate that i look for centenarian studies so people who live to a hundred years or older and the largest study that i can find for that included more than 1700 people who had an average age or actually a median age of 100 years and for that group their ast was 21.3 so i've extended the curve with a green line and so then what we can see for the aging data is that ast increases then decreases during aging so would an ast of 20 then be indicative of youth or old age since we've got basically an uh upside down u in terms of its uh aging curve so the aging data can't answer that so what about uh what's optimal for ast in terms of all-cause mortality risk so uh this is data from the same study and i should mention this is a very large study more than 416 000 subjects and this is all cause mortality data so the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against different levels of ast on the x so uh they selected 15 to 24 for ast as the reference and then what you can see is that there's a 39 increased risk for all-cause mortality for ast less than 15 but then also an increase significantly increased all-cause mortality risk for ast values that were 25 or higher and note that these are are are not small increases you know 96 percent increase for asd 40 to 69 and almost four-fold higher increased all-cause mortality risk for ast greater than 70. So ast is commonly discussed as a marker of liver health how does it compare with liver disease and liver cancer so here we're looking at liver disease mortality risk and this includes liver cancer but other diseases related to the liver including including cirrhosis so again when starting with 15 to 24 for ast as the reference which is in that red triangle now we can see that people who had ast less than 15 actually had a significantly reduced risk of death from liver disease so the hazard ratio there there is 0.36 which means that that's a 64 decreased risk of death from liver disease for people who had uh ast levels that were less than 15. Now conversely having ast levels higher than 24 so 25 up past 70 now we can see very high increase uh increases for liver disease mortality risk so almost a five-fold increase increased liver disease mortality for people who had 25 to 39 and remember this is within the reference range so even within the reference range there's a five-fold increase for liver disease mortality people who had 40 to 69 ast levels had a 27-fold increase risk for liver disease and having asd greater than 70 was even worse with a 73-fold increased risk for liver disease mortality now if you remember on the all-cause mortality data there was an increased all-cause mortality for ast less than 15 but yet there's a decreased risk for liver disease mortality for ast15 so what's contributing to the additional increase in in all-cause mortality risk besides liver disease and it's cancer so for people who had ast less than 15 in this study there was an overall increase in cancer uh and more specifically in non-liver cancer note that for people who uh had ast less than 15 in line with the overall liver disease data we can see that people who had ast less than 15 rarely have liver cancer at least in this study with only two deaths out of 912 total deaths in the study whereas non-liver cancer there was a significant increase uh increased risk for that a 33 increase for having asd less than 15 thereby resulting in an overall increased cancer risk of 27 for the people who had ast less than 15. Now also note that having higher uh than the 15 to 24 uh reference interval in this study was also associated with an overall overall increase for cancer risk but also now an increase for liver cancer risk in fact 5.3 fold higher risk for liver cancer when compared with 15 to 24 and then taking it further we can see even greater risks for cancer risk and both liver cancer and non-liver cancer risk for the 40 to 69 ast group and the greater than 70 asd group now uh also interesting in this study is that they looked at life expectancy so the longest life expectancy in this study was it was for people who had ast levels that were between 15 to 24 ius per liter so starting with the data on the left just to illustrate one example uh for people that were in the 30 year old age group we can see that if if their ast was 15 to 24 they had an average expected life expectancy of 53 and a half years so someone who was 30 that had had those ast values would be expected to live to about 83 and a half now ast values higher than the 15 to 24 range then had lower a lower life expectancy so a small decrease in life expectancy for the 25 to 39 group so about one year shorter than the 15 to 24 group but then we can see the 40 to 69 group has a seven year seven and a half years shorter life expectancy and having asd greater than 70 had up to a 17-year decrease in life expectancy and this is illustrated here in this graph so years of life lost on the y-axis plotted against the ast categories uh and this is all when compared with the 15 to 24 group so looking at the 30 year olds we can again see that about one year decrease in life expectancy for the 25 to 39 ast group and then we can see about a seven year loss of life expectancy for people who had ast between 40 and 69 about a 10-year loss in life expectancy for people greater than 40 ast values and then again up to 17 years of life expectancy a shorter life expensive expectancy for people who had ast that was greater than 70. Now this was true at every for every age group a shorter life expectancy when compared with uh asd values between 15 to 24 and this is data in men uh similar data were also observed in in women so 15 to 24 was identified as a group that had the longest life expectancy when compared with all of the other ast groupings so that data was in a study of 416 000 subjects even bigger studies could get closer to if this is a real effect or not so in the largest study that i was able to find on the association between asc levels with all-cause mortality risk we can see in this study they included a data for up to 16 more than 16.6 million people so here 20 a median value of 20 was defined as the reference and when compared with asd values of 20 we can see that the groups that had median values of 21 and 23 had significantly decreased all-cause mortality risk which is in line with the data presented in the in the previous slide also note that uh the group that had a median value of 27 had a 1.3 hazard ratio which means a 30 percent increased all-cause mortality risk for people who had ast values that were a median asd value of 27 so again as i mentioned these are similar results to the 15 to 24 optimal range for ast in the previous study so with all this in mind i've been tracking ast since 2008 what's my data so uh starting with my pre pre-diet tracking data this is uh from 2008 to 2013 i was just going to my doctor once a year for physical and then recording my blood test results not really tracking diet that seriously and based on these six measurements over that time span we can see that my average asd value was 24.3 which isn't too far from the 15 to 24 uh quote unquote optimal range and then since 2015 i've been measuring ast more often and i started diet tracking in 2015 including weighing all of my food logging that in an online calculator which gives me macro and micronutrients and obviously food amounts and then putting all that data into an excel file and then taking the average dietary intake that corresponds to each blood test and with enough blood tests and dietary periods i can then look for correlations to try to see how my diet can impact my biomarkers so as you can see from 2015 to 20 20 21 i've measured ast 30 times because it's included on the standard chemistry panel and cbc which i get up to six times per year and what we can see in the past six years is that my ast levels have significantly increased from the average of 24 to up to 30 and a half and 30 and a half although it's the average early in 2017 we can see that my data was most definitely going in the wrong direction with values getting approaching 40. Now fortunately i've been able to again look at the correlations in my data between my diet and blood tests and try to make changes along the way to try to get my asd values closer to that 15 to 24 range and away from the 40s that i was close to seeing and as you can see by the arrow that's pointing down i've had some success with that and most recently over my last seven measurements it's it's relatively going in the right direction with an average ast of 27.1 not perfect yet but getting there so the question is which dietary variables are then correlated with ast at least for me so uh of all of my uh macro and micronutrients that i track and it's somewhere in the range of 40 different macro macro and including the micronutrients the strongest correlation with ast was for beta cryptoxanthin now that name may sound familiar because relatively higher levels of beta-cryptozambin which is one of the carotenoids is associated with a younger epigenetic age and if you missed that video on carotenoids uh in a younger epigenetic age it's right there in the right corner so as you can see from the curve from the graph on the left uh a significant correlation and a relatively strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.7 uh so the higher my beta cryptoxanthin intake is that's correlated with a higher ast and in fact going in the wrong direction so early in 2017 or so i was eating a lot of butternut squash and one reason is because of its carotenoid content it's loaded with uh carotenes and also beta cryptoxanthin so one pound of uh a butternut squash has about 14 000 micrograms of beta cryptozambin now there isn't an rda for for beta cryptozambin so i i had no idea how much i should eat of it or not but clearly this data suggests that i may be eating too much of it so after seeing that uh this correlation a few years ago i started to reduce my butternut squash intake and i replaced it with a food that has a lower density of beta cryptozambin in this case red bell peppers where one pound of red bell peppers has significantly less only about 2 200 micrograms of beta cryptoxanthin so i don't want to eliminate it when considering that a higher blood level of beta cryptoxanthin is associated with younger epigenetic age so most recently i've been eating more red bell peppers and almost no butternut squash or none for the past year or two in an effort to get some but not too much so when looking at this data if i aim for a lower intake of beta cryptoxanthin about 2 000 micrograms per day it may improve my ast levels if correlation is indeed causing these changes but i don't want to just improve one biomarker and make three or four others worse i want to see if the net effect on my biomarkers is positive or negative so to do that i investigated associations that actually correlations with other biomarkers um so in this case uh here we can see the correlation for beta cryptoxanthin with my homo homocysteine levels and i've only measured homocysteine 12 times over the past six years it's not included on the standard chemistry panel at cbc so it's an extra test that i have to order but nonetheless we can see that strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.79 for a higher beta kryptosampton intake being correlated with higher levels of homocysteine going in the wrong direction so if i were to cut my beta cryptoxanthin intake again if correlation is indeed causation um then i would expect lower homocysteine levels which would be going in the right direction and i have a homosystem video too if you're interested in that that'll also be in the right corner and actually for all of these biomarkers that i'm going to show uh if you're interested in the in the videos for aging and all-cause mortality data please click on the right corner and check them out so uh it isn't just homocysteine that's correlated with my beta-cryptoxanthin data also red blood cells rbcs and in this case this is a significant negative correlation so a higher beta cryptoxanthin intake is correlated with lower red blood cells going in the wrong direction so if i were to cut my beta cryptoxanthin intake to about 2 000 micrograms per day that would uh based on the trend line for the plot that would be correlated with higher levels of red blood cells which is going in the right direction so so far so good beta cryptoxanthin if i were to reduce it potentially favorable effects on three biomarkers now it isn't three biomarkers but four so here's the correlation between beta cryptoxanthin with the mean corpuscular volume mcv and i have 27 measurements for this over the past six years and we can see a moderate correlation 0.5 but statistically significant based on the p-value so here we it it shows uh a correlation for higher beta cryptoxanthin is correlated with a higher mcv which is going in the wrong direction now again if i were to cut my beta cryptaxanthin intake based on the trend line that will be correlated with a lower mcv which is going in the right direction and again if you missed that video please click in the right corner to check it out so so far uh reducing my beta krypton intake may be associated with favorable effects for four biomarkers so um will that negative are there any biomarkers that would be negatively affected by reducing my beta kryptoxanthin intake and the answer is maybe yes so here we can see a negative correlation significant negative correlation between beta cryptoxanthin with my glucose levels so the higher my beta cryptozenethine intake that's correlated with lower glucose and glucose increases during aging so this is a a higher levels of beta cryptozambin would be seen to be favorable for my glucose levels so if i were to cut my beta crystal xanthine intake based on that trendline that would be potentially going in the wrong direction for glucose levels similarly for triglycerides so if i were to cut my beta cryptoxanthin intake to about 2000 micrograms per day that would be correlated with higher triglycerides up to about 60 milligrams per deciliter in my data which is also going in the wrong direction as triglycerides also increase during aging so the net effect of reducing but again not eliminating because beta cryptozanthin at least in blood is correlated with a younger epigenetic age i if i reduce it i may have four biomarkers going in the right direction but two in the wrong direction so that's net positive uh four going well two may be wrong so overall plus two now note that i didn't just look at those six biomarkers i also evaluated the other correlations for beta kryptoxanthin with all of the other variables on the veins a biological age calculator phenotypic age including creatinine albumin alkaline phosphatase white blood cells lymphocyte percentage red blood cell distribution with rdw high sensitivity crc reactive protein overall phenotypic age and then uh hdl because i'm interested in getting my hdl into the 50s so i wanted to see how it affected that now note that no significant correlations were identified for any of these biomarkers uh with beta cryptoxanthin as they all had very weak correlation coefficient coefficients less than 0.24 now this is just one example of my approach for optimizing blood biomarkers through diet there were other nutrients too including omega-6 and niacin that were significantly correlated with ast so in the interest of time i won't go through that today uh for my next blood test which is going to be next week at some point i'll do an ast update video and i'll include only the data the dietary data uh we won't have to present the all-cause mortality data because i've already shown that all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
