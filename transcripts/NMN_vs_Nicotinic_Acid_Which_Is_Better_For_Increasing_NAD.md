# NMN vs Nicotinic Acid: Which Is Better For Increasing NAD?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number four in 2023 for a july 5th test i sent blood to gfinity for nad analysis to test the hypothesis that 600 mig of nicotinic acid per day for 9 days before the test would raise nad and in an earlier video we saw that to be true as it raised the 2 67.4 micromolar that value is about 2 to three times higher than my baseline level of ned without any ned precursors of 20 to 25 micromolar which is a relatively low value but on the same day as that test we also saw that my epigenetic pace of aging as measured by dun and pace was also my worst to date and i learned that by sending blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own ned levels or your epigenetic pace of aging discount link in the video video description for both of these uh tests so in terms of the dum pace value it was 0.98 which means that for every one year of chronological aging there's one year of an ep genetic pace of aging so epigenetic aging now ideally we want to be at around 0.6 which is the slowest epigenetic pace of aging so this is a bad result and it then raises the question is this a nicotinic acid induced outlier so to evaluate that let's take a look at all of my data for the first nine tests that covered 2022 and 2023 for denan pace of aging and changes over time so first we can see that that outlier of or potential outlier of 0 98 and the rest of my data which is not close to 0.98 but that doesn't tell us if that's an outlier or not so the average 8 test average for den and pace without the 0.98 is 0.80 and when calculating the standard deviation which is 0.043 for these eight tests when multiplying that by four we can see that 0.98 is more than four standard deviations from the average generally more than three standard deviations from the average is considered an outlier so this data point of 0.98 is indeed an outlier potentially or probably caused by high dose nicotinic acid but it also raises a different question did high dose nicotinic acid mess up denita paast or is it just a matter of ned being too high so to test that if i increase ned to also greater than 60 micromolar will den and pace again look like an outlier so the first half of that experiment those results are in for a december 11th test i supplemented with 2 g of nmn per day for 11 days before this test i sent blood to gfinity for ned analysis and then we can see that i was able to raise nad again to 61 micromolar now unfortunately the second half of this experiment the results are not yet in from true di true diagnostic those results are expected on january 10th so as soon as i get that data i'll make a video relatively shortly thereafter but we can what we can also learn from these results is that at least in my case for increase nad 2,000 mig of nmn per day is about similar to 600 mig of nicotinic acid in other words a relatively lower dose of nicotinic acid raises nad to at least the same ballpark as 2,000 mgs of nmn and even even taking it a step further in an earlier video we saw that i was able to raise nad to around 40 micromolar with just 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day and with no flush there is flushing or for me at least there was flushing at 600 mig per day whereas it took 1,000 mig per day to raise nad to around 40 micromol so in that case around 60 mig of nicotinic acid is similar similar to a th000 for nmn for raising nad to around 40 micromolar all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buck aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for nad epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home metabolomic at home blood testing with scifox health which includes apob diet tracking green tea or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or di trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
