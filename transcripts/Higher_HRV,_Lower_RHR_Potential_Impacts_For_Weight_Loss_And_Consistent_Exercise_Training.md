In the last video we saw that heart rate variability is increased by 38% since 2018 while reducing the resting heart rate by 15% over that same time span in today's video we'll take a look at what may be contributing to improved data for heart rate variability and resting heart rate since 2018 now the most obvious impact on heart rate variability and resting heart rate is physical activity so let's start with that now whoop provides the average daily heart rate as an index of physical activity so let's take a look at correlations for the average daily heart rate with next day resting heart rate which is what we can see here on the y- axis we've got the next day resting heart rate plotted against the previous day's average daily heart rate again is an index of physical activity on the x and here we can see a significant positive correlation between the two in other words too much daily activity too often will be bad for my or potentially bad for my resting heart rate so what about heart rate variability we can see that data here and now there's a significant negative correlation in other words too much daily activity too often is potentially bad for heart rate variability so together we can see that the higher my previous day's average daily heart rate that's significantly correlated with worse data for heart rate variability and the resting heart rate so finding the balance between active and rest days is important for optimizing these metrics so what does that look like so here's a 7-day plot for the average daily heart rate now on the active day that's the day that includes my usual workout it's an 85 minute full body workout that includes strength training but also calisthenics mobility flexibility etc so after the active day i purposefully titrate overall activity the overall average daily heart rate lower for the next two days and then include my usual workout again followed by at least 2 days of a tit trated lower average daily heart rate now lately i've been going on a 3-day 4-day cycle where i add an extra day of hydrating the activity lower and i haven't experienced any strength or functional deficits during my usual workouts so two workouts per week that seems to be best for optimizing my heart rate variability and resting heart rate over time as it allows for enough recovery prior to each workout now physical activity isn't the only variable that may affect the resling heart rate and heart rate variability and body weight is another factor that seems to have a big impact so what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate so first we'll take a look at my average monthly body weight since i started tracking cardiovascular fitness metrics in august of 2018 and note that body weight data is recorded every morning after using the bathroom and fasted and then let's also take a look at the average monthly resting heart rate over that same time period and note that these two plots seem to have a lot of overlap during periods when body weight has been reduced resting heart rate de has decreased and conversely during periods where body weight has increased resting heart rate has increased and rather than just looking at two plots and looking for similarities and overlap is there a direct correlation is body weight significantly correlated with the resting heart rate so for that i have about 1,00 days of data and we're going to look at daily heart rate the daily resting heart rate versus body weight which is what we can see here and here we can see a significant positive correlation in other words as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate and conversely as my body weight has approached 142 lbs which is where i current around where i currently am the resting heart rate has approached lower values around 41 beats per minute which then raises the question what will happen if i'm able to get even leaner will i start to see an at a resting heart rate of 40 or below so stay tuned for that we'll have to see how that develops in future videos so what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability so first starting with the body weight plot let's take a look at the overall gross morphology of the average monthly heart rate variability is shown there and although that there don't seem to be obvious an obvious overlap with the body weight plot there are some trends during periods where body weight has been reduced heart rate variability has increased and during a period where body weight increased heart rate variability decreased all right what about the direct correlation which is what we can see here and again this is almost 1900 days of data and here we can see a significant negative correlation between the daily heart rate variability with body weight in other words as my body weight has increased that's significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability which is going in the wrong direction and conversely as my body weight has approached 142 lbs or getting leaner heart rate variability has approached more youthful values close to 70 milliseconds and again just like i proposed for the resting heart rate what will happen is i if i'm able to get leaner will i continue to see a an a further increased heart rate variability so stay tuned for that in future videos so to answer the question what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability and resting heart rate they approach youthful values as body weight decreases in other words a higher heart rate variability in conjunction with a lower resting heart rate all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging including daily data for resting heart rate and heart rate variability check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including dis discount links for ad home metabolomics nad quantification epigenetic and tmr testing oral microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
