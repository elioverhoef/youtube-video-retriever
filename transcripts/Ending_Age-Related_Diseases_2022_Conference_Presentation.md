# Ending Age-Related Diseases 2022 Conference Presentation

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease be slowed so that's my central premise and with that in mind last month i blood tested for the fourth time in 2022 so what's my biological age uh so using so using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator which is known as phenotypic age and when entering its nine component biomarkers and chronological age we can see that my biological age using the beans test is 32.6 and that's 16.8 years younger than my chronological so note that these blood tests were performed by quest by the lab quest so their high sensitivity cereal active protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter on the on the lab report so crp could be anywhere from zero to uh 0.3 so i entered the upper limit of that 0.3 now note that in contrast to venipuncture which is what quest that's what is performed generally at every lab in contrast with that at home blood biomarker testing may be the next frontier for attempting to slow aging so why is that well you don't need you don't need to go to the lab you can just prick your finger at home whenever you want and why that's beneficial is because you can prick a different finger every day so for example i have up to 38 blood tests since 2015 so about five an average of about five tests per year through venipuncture in contrast i could get 40 blood tests theoretically by pricking a different finger every day in six weeks instead of seven years so one can get closer to biomarker optimization much faster with uh at home blood biomarker testing so with that in mind i got a kit from a company i'm not sponsored by them so i won't uh indicate who it was but this is an at-home dried blood spot test so you basically just prick your finger you put it on a card and uh you mail it off and they they you know they tell you the results uh one or two days later so i got the at home drive bloods blood spot test for uh hscrp and so then the big question is is at home testing as good as the gold standard which is venipuncture and note that uh the lab test the in-person lab test was about 7 30 in the morning fasted so when i got home i also then did the finger prick test so the fingerprint test is about an hour later still fasted so then to answer the question was high sensitivity c-reactive protein less than 0.3 milligrams per liter and that's an important question because if it's higher then it's probably not a reliable test but if it's lower that suggests that it could be as good as venipuncture which is good news so uh here's that their lab report from the at home test for hscrp and we can see that actually their the sensitivity of their test is a little bit better than the uh in person venipuncture test so the the upper or the lower the upper limit of their sensitivity is 0.2 milligrams per liter so uh and my data was less than 0.2 milligrams per liter so it would appear that this at home test is as good as venipuncture for at least detecting hscrp i can't guarantee that for other uh at home dried blood spot tests but at least for hscrp that's good news so uh to answer the question was hscrp less than point milligrams per liter we can give it a resounding yes and then we can return to uh levine's test data and instead of 0.3 milligrams per liter we can put the upper limit for the at home test 0.2 and when i do that my biological age is then 32.2 for this test which is 17 years younger than my chronological of 49.4 so how did these data compare with earlier tests it's it you know it may be relatively easy to quote unquote biohack one test but what's the bigger picture what what's my uh what's my biological age over many tests over many years so for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2020 and that's what we can see here levine's biological age on the y-axis plotted against time so in 2020 i blood tested six times and using levine's test and entering my biomarker data i get an average age of 35.6 years similarly also 35.6 years in 2021 over six tests and then over four tests the first four tests in 2022 i plan on measuring at least three more times we can see that my average is 33.9 years so i'm off to a good start in terms of lowering it now i don't think i can lower it much further than where it is now once you get your biomarker values to youthful levels then the key is just maintaining them for maintaining them for as long as possible so now as another way of looking at this note that prior to 2022 my average biological age reduction relative to my chronological age was about 12 years and that's over 15 tests so from 2018 to 2019 i also blood tested three times so plus the 12 blood test in 2020 and 2021 though that's 15 tests so my average chronological age minus biological age about 12 12 years over those 15 tests but so far in 2022 i've further reduced that such that my average reduction per test is 15.2 years so a further three year reduction now note that phenoage while i'm a big fan of it don't get me wrong i'm not here to knock it by any means while it includes chronological it includes chronological age in its model which limits the maximum biological age reduction and that's important because if i maintain these biomarkers indefinitely say let's say when i'm 80 years old and nothing has changed except for my chronological age what's built into this metric is even with these same biomarker values my biological age at the age of 80 would be 59. So to me that doesn't seem right if if your biochemistry is the same you shouldn't be at most 20 years younger so it's a limitation of the of the training set that they use they probably didn't have super healthy fit people in there not that i'm saying i am but anyway that's a limitation of the model uh so anyway in contrast aging.ai does not include chronological agents models so greater reductions for biological age are possible so then what's my aging.ai uh blood test what's what's what's my biological age using aging.ai so my aging dot ai 3.0 again free to use like levine's test you can put your own data in at aging.ei and i'm not sponsored by either of these companies i'm just grateful they exist so that i can calculate these my biological age using these metrics uh so when entering the 19 component biomarkers as shown there on the july 11th 2022 test i get a biological age of 28 which is 21.4 years younger than my chronological now data for one blood test is good but just like we did for levine's test let's look at more data to get more context to see how i'm doing so i have a lot more data that can compute aging.ii biological age uh the difference is that all of these biomarkers are found on the standard chem panel the lipid panel and the cbc which is basically a standard physical that you get at a yearly uh checkup that uh with your doctor at least here in the united states so on levine's test it requires hscrp that's like an add-on extra test that you've got to pay extra for so i wasn't doing that way back when in 2009 but i did have at least basic uh basic data from my yearly physical with my doctor from starting in 2009. So uh starting from 2009 to 2013 i was only measuring at most once a year and i have three blood test uh points over that that five year stand or four year span and my average aging.ai age was 32. And then in 2016 i decided to start testing more often to try to get a more reflective uh overview of how my biological age looks look and more specifically how all of the component biomarkers i'm not married to the you know the qtc number of a biological age i want all of these component biomarkers to be youthful for as long as possible so in 2016 to 2021 i then tested 27 times and and over those 27 tests my average aging.iii age was just the tick under 30 29.9 years so what about in 2022 so we can see that there and after four tests i've further reduced it to 28 and a half years now just as i mentioned for levine's test i don't think i can further reduce it beyond this range i mean it uh pro i can i'm confident that i can keep it around 30 a little or a little below almost indefinitely or that's the hope so then the bigger question is how long can i resist these age-related biomarker changes will i be 80 90 100 and beyond with the biochemistry of a 30 year old will see so what's contributing to these biological age reductions am i taking gear protectors or cenalytics what's my diet so in terms of what's contributing to these data let's just take a look at supplements so i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking levothyroxine i'm currently taking 137.5 micrograms per day and i've been doing that for probably half my life and then uh for um i take vitamin d probably about eight or nine months of the year i live in boston so for eight or nine months of the year here i'm not getting adequate sun exposure so i take a thousand i use per day but for some of the portion of the this blood test for the 63 day period that corresponds to this blood test i didn't take it so uh probably 80 if uh 80 of the days i took vitamin d that you know for this blood test and then i do take occasional melatonin either before bed or in the middle of the night but you can see this isn't a lot this is only about 39 micrograms per day not milligrams so it's just you know it's a fraction of a milligram so very small amounts when i feel like i need to get better sleep and that's it no other supplements no gear protectors or synalytics i have taken methyl b12 in the past but for a few blood tests at least in 2022 i stopped taking it uh and if anyone's curious i can answer that uh you know bit after after the presentation all right so then what about diet how's diet or how might diet contribute to these data so you can see that my blood test was on july 11th but that doesn't tell us anything about how diet may correspond so the average daily dietary intake from my last blood test on may 9th to the day before this blood test uh on july 10th corresponds to blood test number four in 2022. So how am i tracking diet how am i doing that so in taking a look at the calendar because it's easier easier to illustrate here we can see may june and july and then i blood as i mentioned i blood tested on may may 9th that was blood test number three and then test number four on july 11th so in between are 63 days in between tests and that's what corresponds to blood test number four the average intake for those 63 days uh corresponds to test number four and so every day since april of 2015 i've weighed all my food and then i've entered those food amounts into chronometer it's an online tracking app i'm not here to say they're the best there are others that one can use but that's what i've used since uh 2015. And then i enter daily uh the daily chronometer data the chronometer data into a spreadsheet my own personal spreadsheet just an excel spreadsheet nothing special and then i compute the average intake for those 63 days and then i line that up with the blood test data blood test number four and then since every blood test has a corresponding diet composition or an average corresponding diet composition with enough data for both blood biomarkers and diet again i can investigate correlations and then based on the correlations i can modify my diet or even supplements for one if that's what one wants to do i can modify those with the goal of optimizing the blood biomarkers so in a sense i'm not only am i optimizing biomarkers this is kind of a precision nutrition approach so i'm covering basically both bases so let's first start off by looking at the individual food amounts or at least some of the individual food amounts that corresponded to this blood test so i've got the first 23 foods listed here and this again is for the 63 day period that corresponded to the latest blood test amount in grams at the top and then ranked based on the highest intake to the lowest intake so why are these foods at the top why have i chosen to include these foods so by tracking diet in conjunction with blood biomarkers i can focus on eating foods that have positive correlative scores with the blood biomarkers while minimizing intake for foods with negative scores so for that let's take a look at correlations for strawberry intake with what i've come to define as big picture biomarkers now note that this is uh right now it's about 24 blood biomarkers and i have plans to expand it on uh additional upcoming tests uh and bridging out into uh hormones like dhea so it's a current it's a constantly expanding uh panel of pictures big picture biomarkers and note that although i've tracked macros and micro since 2015 i only started tracking individual food amounts since 20 2018. So in other words i have less tests so i have up to 23 blood tests that correspond to diet uh in contrast with macros micros where i have a lot more data up to 38 blood tests all right so here are the big picture biomarkers and just to run through them they include obviously things like glucose which in my opinion should be on any panel aimed at optimizing or slowing aging um homocysteine which i haven't given it so haven't given it its own category yet but i've grouped it with glucose just for now three markers of kidney function three markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins immune related cells in a protein globulin red blood cell related related measures a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c reactive protein and then the overall biological biological age score using phenoage and aging.ai so just a further introduces the little end next next to x sorry next to each blood test is how many blood tests that that i had that correspond to that biomarker the r at the top left is the correlation and the p-value is the measure of statistical significance with less than 0.05 being statistically significant all right so what's significantly associated with strawberry intake so a relatively higher strawberry intake is significantly associated with a lower level of the liver is that liver enzyme ast a lower ldl lower levels of platelets and a lower high sensitivity reactive protein so once the there are significant correlations the next step is identifying whether the significant correlations are going in the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk and i don't have time to go into that in this video but i have plenty of those videos on my youtube channel so if you're interested in that check it out or we can talk about it after the presentation but just to go through it real quick for something like ast uh even just using the reference range i've had data that's been higher than the reference range and somewhere around 20 is optimal based on all cost mortality data so since this is an inverse association that suggests higher strawberry intake is correlated with lower a and right direction so i've given it a green arrow so green arrows will be going in the so you can see that there are four green arrows and that gives me a net correlative score of plus four so what does that mean if the net score was negative that would indicate that i should be below my average intake if the net score was zero i would need at my average intake and if the net score was positive it should be above my intake so my average strawberry intake since 2018 is 350 grams per day we can see that for this test i averaged 622 grams so i'm following that correlation so we give it a green check so let's do another example red bell peppers so here we'll take a look at correlations for red bell peppers with these big picture biomarkers so we can see that red bell pepper intake is smoothly correlated with higher creatinine with higher neutrophils and then a lower lymph side percentage and you can see i've given these all red arrows because they're going in the wrong direction similarly neutrophils increase during aging and the lymph side percentage declines during aging so those are going in the wrong direction in terms of their correlation with red bell pepper intake so three red arrows we can see that the net score is minus three when the net score is negative that suggests i should eat below my average intake my average daily red bell pepper intake since 2018 is 298 grams per day and we can see that i i purposefully ate below that red is indicative of it's going in the wrong direction so for example a relatively higher carrot intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine so that would be going in the right direction because homocysteine increases during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so my average intake since 2018 is 372 grams i should be eating above that based on the positive net score but we can see that i'm not so that we give that a red x and uh this is a there's a there's a little bit more depth to that story um part of it involves beta carotene so if anybody's curious i can answer questions about that later uh why haven't gone above 372 four carats all right so mushrooms have a net score of plus four significantly correlated with lower levels of alkaline phosphatase ast crp ldl and platelets but a higher uh homocysteine so five going in the right direction one in the wrong gives it the net score plus four so prior to 20 prior to 2018 i was eating lots of mushrooms but i took them out until relatively recently so we can see that my average intake isn't very high so it was easy to eat above them for this test 231 grams per day so red arrow sorry green uh check because i'm following the correlations next up are beets and i'm not a fan of the term superfoods but we can see that beets for whatever reason in my data have a net score of plus eight with eight biomarkers going in the right direction and none in the wrong including a lower overall aging.ai age uh lower ast lower creatinine glucose ldl neutrophils and platelets we can see inverse correlations for all those but a higher lymphocyte percentage and remember lymphocyte percentage declines during aging so my average intake for beets is 115 grams per day and we can see that 206 is greater than 115 so i follow the correlation there next up collard greens and net score of uh plus one it's significantly correlated with lower ldl and uh i've recently switched from spinach to seeing a lot of spinach basically forever and i recently switched because oxalates in my data have a very negative overall score collard greens have are very low in oxalates by comparison so i recently switched that that's why you can see my average intake of collard greens is very low and it was easy to eat above that for this test and then last on this list are is watermelon net score of plus five which suggests i should eat above my average intake of 152 and i did that for this test with an intake of 200 grams per day all right so as i mentioned by following the correlations for as many foods and macros and micros i also use this approach for all the macros and micronutrients as possible i expect that my best biomarker profile will result so what about the rest of the diet including macros and microbes and i don't have time to go into it in this presentation but i have lots of youtube videos on that on my channel and you can check it out there so uh with that uh i'll i'm ready for questions all right thank you very much michael yeah we've got several questions coming in so um regarding um well regarding uh biomarkers of aging um i've got one but here's one from our audience uh do you measure your photo age there are apps for that would your photo age be non-increasing as your epigenetic age or blood age yeah and you you look great by the way so i think it is i think it is holding steady thanks oliver i haven't i haven't done photo age yet um i think a lot of things can probably impact it like lighting and and you know sleep that i get enough sleep on that day but it gets into the bigger question of you know skin aging right is uh how do you optimize skin skin aging and uh i think that probably is the hardest thing to optimize you know you can take someone that's 100 years old and maybe optimize their biochemistry and many other organ organ systems but you know their skin will still look old so um that's on the to-do list and figuring figuring that out okay another question is uh you show no consumption of alcoholic beverages or other recreational drugs wines in particular have been suggested as health enhancers do you see nothing but harm from consuming them yes so that's a tricky thing because uh i wear a fitness tracker and i track my heart rate variability and resting heart rate these are metrics of cardiovascular fitness and there's a ton of data on alcohol messing up cardiovascular metrics so i already have some issues with sleep or i should say i'm always so that's answer number one answer number two is i've read or heard anecdotally or both that alcohol can mess with uh sleep quality in terms of increasing light sleep while taking away from rem and slow wave sleep and i'm constantly trying to optimize my sleep so that would work against me if i was uh drinking even a small amount of alcohol so and then um you know it's not new alcohol is not nutrient-dense the whole food is you know grapes so uh one can make an argument that i should maybe include grapes in my in my approach rather than the processed version of the whole food so um fourth by looking i hate to say scoreboard and look at the blood biomarkers but how would you further improve that what what would you expect that alcohol would further improve in my biomarker data if it isn't going to improve my cv metrics if it isn't going to improve the blood biomarkers i don't see a need so that said this is the approach for me now for others they may have different experiences with alcohol where there it improves their blood biomarkers or it doesn't affect their sleep or you know whatever the case may be uh you know but i'd encourage objective you know uh objective metric train uh metric tracking so that they can see rather than taking it based on some epidemiological or some rct does it actually improve some objective measures of health at the individual level so and you've got a lot of blood-based markers obviously that you're looking at but have you have you been correlating them with or performing other types of kind of more easily accessible physiologic based markers um on yourself such as gait or cognitive testing or lung volume for example have you been doing that yeah not long volume yet but in terms of the physical function measures as i mentioned i'm tracking the stevie metrics and i hate to say my cv metrics have never been better but i i basically had a person uh pr personal record this morning for heart rate variability and resting heart rate so i'm on the right track there um my workouts are standardized you know you hear the thing you know switching up your workouts why i don't do that my workouts are standardized i know exactly how many sets and reps and how much weight i'm doing you know workout to work out week to week year to year so i know if my strength is going to decline because i have these things standardized so since i've been doing that over the past three or four years there's no decrement and strength at all at worst i've maintained strength um so so fev in terms of lung volume is a great measure that's on the to-do list but i have expanded it into other things like um the oral microbiome i think that maybe uh you know the blood blood biomarker metrics may miss changes in the oral microbiome and you could have microbes in the mouth that may be associated with you know uh plaque formation or alzheimer's disease um so i've recently gotten gotten into uh quantifying that and then trying to optimize that so uh it's a it's a constantly expanding approach but you know trying to include as many things as possible i don't want to i don't want to get to 8 90 100 and and realize that i missed something that i should have been tracking okay i think one more question i remember this from from a talk he gave a while back i think may have been even a live consequence when we when we did that pre-covered um you mentioned that i think one of one of the more important markers uh that you had was albumin levels um is that is that um would you like to maybe talk just to make a few comments on that if that's you know how relevant that is um or has that changed does this based on data that you later collected yeah uh so albumin still very important not just its uh inclusion on these two biological age calculators it's not just because of that but in terms of the concentration of the protein that's the most abundant in blood it's albumin and its levels decline during aging and relatively low levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so and there's plenty of data to linking relatively low levels of albumin with decreased physical function just as an example so yeah my albumin levels are still high and youthful but i've learned that you know even even based on what's youthful and what's associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk higher is not necessarily better and in fact in my data i've had values as high as you know five two five three five four and even though that's still within the reference range when i do a biomarker versus biomarker analysis in other words albumin versus the quote-unquote big picture biomarkers so uh how you know how well does that fit in into the context of the broader systemic health there is too high you know there can be too high even within the reference frame so um with that in mind i've tried to focus it more narrowly around four eight four nine and try to limit the times when i'm five one five two five three five four and uh so far so good with that but yeah albumin is still super important um beta carotene is still very strongly correlated with albumin in my data however i should mention i've i've seen people where that's true people that are that i work with that i'm tracking helping them track their data where they also have correlations with albumin for beta care team but then others that don't have that correlation in their data so i can't say that everybody go go eat more character you'll have higher albumin actually they've actually got to measure and try to identify the factors that may uh you know impact it for them [music] you
