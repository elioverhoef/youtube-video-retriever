# Are Turmeric And Black Pepper Bad For Health?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A few months ago dr paul saladino posted a video saying that we should stop eating turmeric and black pepper more recently physionic posted papers in a video on his channel about why paul may be wrong now rather than rehash that story i can add to it as i have 35 blood tests over the past six plus years so with that in mind are turmeric or black pepper bad for health so let's start off with the approach since 2015 i've weighed all my food with a food scale i've then entered those daily food amounts into uh an app known as chronometer and if you want to track your own diet using chronometer discount link below and then i've taken that data and entered it into a spreadsheet now note that i've tracked macros and micros since 2015 but it wasn't until 2018 that i started manually entering food intake into that spreadsheet too so i have six years of tracked food intake including turmeric and black pepper so then each blood test over the past 6 years has a corresponding average dietary intake for example if there's a 50-day period in between blood tests because i'm tracking diet the average daily intake for those 50 days lines up with the latter test so then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake and then i can calculate correlations once i have enough blood test and trct dietary data so with that in mind we can see how much turmeric i've consumed for each blood test over the past 6 years and that's what's shown here so note that i've had had medium low and relatively high intakes of turmeric over this 6-year period and again each of those dots corresponds to a blood test so average turmeric intake during this 6-year period is 1.3 gram per day and note that this is a ground turmeric powder almost exclusively all of it there may have been a test or two where i tried adding a little bit of fresh turmeric but it's almost exclus exclusively ground turmeric powder more recently though my average turmeric intake is closer to 3 g per day all right simp similar story for black pepper i've had times with medium low and relatively high intakes average black pepper intake during this 6 6year period is .5 gram per day and more recently my average intake or current intake is around 2 gram per day all right so then i as i mentioned i calculate correlations for diet with biomarkers and we can use that approach to evaluate whether turmeric or black pepper may be bad neutral or good for health at least in my case which then raises the question which biomarkers so now we're going to take a look at 26 comparisons for biomarkers with turmeric and black pepper with biomarkers of many organ systems and that's what we can see here so it it's it may be hard to see so i' recommend going full screen if you haven't already so i've broken this down into segments so we've got four markers of metabolic health including glucose hdl ldl and triglycerides three markers of kidney function including creatinine blood uer nitrogen bu bun and uric acid three markers of liver function including albumin the combination of a and alt and note that i combine them because i find that more informative rather than looking at either of the those two alone and also alkaline phosphatase as a marker of liver function immune related components and note that i don't track total white blood cells but i split them up into into their differentials including the sum of neutrophils and monocytes as both both of those increase in the same direction during aging lymphocytes the lymph side percentage and platelets three markers of red blood cell related measures including r total red blood cells the red blood cell distribution with or rdw which is a major contributor to morgan lavine's dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag and the average red cell volume the mcv five markers of biological age including pheno ag aging.ai two markers of epigenetic aging horvath and donan pace and then tiir length which generally isn't a good marker of biolog i age but it declines during aging and it's a hall mark of aging so i think it's important to include that in terms of androgens i have data for dhea sulfate over this period for vascular health i have systolic blood pressure and homosysteine and then for inflammation i have high sensitivity c reactive protein so that's the panel of 26 biomarkers and then at the top of the columns we on the left we've got the correlation coefficient lowercase r the p value as the measure of statistical significance and in this case we're going to use 0.05 less than that as a significant correlation and then on the right we've got the number of tests so you can see that i have up to 35 tests for the blood biomarkers and then as low as 11 tests for blood pressure 12 tests for dhea sulfate and the epigenetic measures but the majority on this list more than 30 tests and then i'm going to color code the correlations when tumeric is going in the right direction or wrong direction so if the correlation is going in the right direction what that means is that tumor's correlation is inverse relative to how the biomarker changes during aging and or all cause mortality risk so as just one quick example we can all agree that glucose levels increase during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so if tumeric is inversely correlated with glucose that would be a green correlation as it would seem to resist the age related increase for glucose conversely i'm going to color code uh correlations red if turmeric's correlation goes in the same direction as age related or all cause mortality changes so with that in mind turmeric is indeed significantly correlated with lower glucose higher hdl and that's good news because hdl declines a bit during aging relatively lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and i should say i'm just saying that information if anybody has uh wants to know where those papers and that data comes from i can post it in the comments and most of that data is already on the channel but leave a comment and i'd be happy to direct you to the uh data for aging and all cause mortality for each of these biomarkers all right so then turmeric is also inversely correlated with blood u nitrogen and uric acid so higher levels of turmeric significantly correlated with lower levels of those two markers of kidney function lower levels of a and alt and alkaline phosphatase lower levels of the combination of nutrifil and monos sites a lower rdw a younger pheno age a longer tiir length uh a lower systolic blood pressure and lower high sensitivity c reactor protein in some there are 12 correlations that are going in the right direction which would seem to resist age related or all cause mortality risk changes but we also have some red correlations and there are four of those first is that turmeric intake is significally correlated with higher triglycerides uh lower levels of platelets and red blood cells note that both of those decline during aging so that would be going in the wrong direction and then higher homosysteine homosysteine increases during aging so a positive correlation in that case for turmeric with homosysteine going in the wrong direction so when we take i should note there's also one more on this list which is ldl and that's a bit more tricky because ldl follows an inverse u during aging low in youth peaks at midlife low also at advanced age so whether relatively low levels would be good or bad that that's that's a bit tricky so nonetheless we've got 12 greens and four reds without considering ldl yet for a net correlative turmeric score of plus eight which suggests that turmeric at least based on these correlations would not be bad for health in my case even factoring ldl that would be a plus 7 or a +9 all right so what about ground black pepper so using the same approach here we've got 10 correlations going in the right direction highlighted in green including glucose lower glucose higher hdl lower uric acid and alkaline phosphotase lower neutrophils and monocytes and rdw a younger pheno age a longer teir length lower systolic blood pressure and lower hscp in terms of the correlations going in the wrong direction codered and red there are three including lower platelets lower red blood cells and higher homosysteine so when taking that score we get a and that also includes ldl here too in in terms of the correlations so when taking that score 10 minus 3 we get a net correlative score for black pepper of plus 7 which could be plus 6 including ldl or plus 8 so based on this data and based on these correlations that would seem like tumeric and black pepper are not bad for health if they were bad for health i'd expect to see a lot more red and a lot less green in terms of correlations but there are a couple of extra layers to this story over this 6-year period i'm 17 lbs lighter so is body weight driving these correlations so for that let's take a look at correlations for body weight with these same 26 biomarkers and specifically only looking at correlation for body weight that overlap with turmeric or black pepper and note that i'm going to give body weight its own video at some point in the near future so this is basically a prelude to that so body weight is inversely correlated with hdl so higher uh body weight is significally correlated with a lower htl red arrow going in the wrong direction lower uh higher uric acid again that's going in the wrong direction uric acid increases during aging higher alkaline phosphatase which higher alkaline phosphatase associated with an increaseed alca mortality risk higher nutrifil and monocytes a higher rdw a lower ti length higher systolic blood pressure increases during aging and higher hscp so we've got a lot of red so far in terms of body weight correlations that overlap with toric or black pepper a higher body weight is also significant correlated with higher platelets and higher red blood cells which would be going in the right direction as both of those decline during aging and also note that higher body weight in my case is also significant correlated with higher ldl which i've given given the purple or dark blue arrow as it could go either way so when summing the reds and greens we get a net overlap score for body weight again these are biomarkers that were also significantly correlated with turmeric or black pepper with uh with a score of minus 6 so that suggests that a lot of the overlap may be coming from body weight so is body weight driving the net correlative scores for turmeric or black pepper so rather than looking at univariate correlations in other words if is turmeric or black pepper on their own signific significantly correlated with a singular biomarker in other words univariate correlations we can investigate associations after adjusting for body weight and that involves linear regression models one of which is shown here so here we're looking at the collective association for turmeric and body weight against glucose and even after adjusting or including body weight in the model we can see that turmeric is still significantly correlated or sorry associated with lower glucose after adjusting for body weight and you can see that the coefficient is negative and the p value is far below 0.05 similarly if we do use the same model for black pepper now black pepper is in the model and also it so is body weight here too we can see that after adjusting for body weight black pepper is significantly associated with lower levels of glucose so together both of these after adjusting for body weight turmeric or black pepper is significantly associated with lower glucose in my data all right so this is just one biomarker though we've got 26 what about the others so now we're going to take a look at body weight adjust the correlations for turmeric with these 26 biomarkers and now at the top columns instead of looking at the correlation coefficient we're going to look at the beta coefficient which is just the measure of is it increasing or a decreasing association and then in the far right column we've got the body weight adjusted p value so that's the p value for the association for turmeric with each biomarker after including body weight in each linear regression model so when using this approach we can see that turmeric is still significantly associated with lower glucose with lower alkaline phosphatase lower neutrophils and monocytes a younger pheno age and lower hscp so we've got five correlations going in the right direction then we have two still going in the wrong so after adjusting for body weight turmeric is still significantly associated with lower platelets and lower red blood cells and again both of those decline during aging that would be going in the wrong direction also note that ldl is still a part of this story as after adjusting for body weight tumeric is still significantly correlated with lower ldl which could go either way nonetheless when taking the uh su summing the greens and reds five going in the right direction minus two in the wrong we get a body weight adjusted net association tumeric score of plus three which could be plus two but it could also be plus4 depending on ldl but still this is a net positive association score in other words tumor is still potentially positive for the net of these 26 biomarkers so similar story for black pepper after adjusting for body weight significantly associated with lower glucose higher hdl lower uric acid a younger pheno age and lower hscrp but also lower platelets and red blood cells which would be going in the wrong direction so that's why they've got red arrows so here too we have five correlations going in the right direction in green and two in the wrong we've got a net body weight adjusted association score for black pepper of plus three so here too turmeric or black pepper after accounting for body weight seems to be a positive at least on the net of these 26 biomarkers but there is a third and last lever level of statistical rigor that we can add to this approach and that's because when using a p value less than 0.05 that means that there are five potential false positive associations per 100 comparisons so to put that into perspective we have 26 comparisons on the left for turmeric and 26 comparisons on the right for black pepper so there could be two at least two false positives in either the greens or reds or even ldl so calculating the fdr or the false discovery rate and using a restrictive fdr of less than 0.05 can help address this so now we're going to take a look at body weight adjusted associations for turmeric with the 26 biomarkers after including the fdr less than 0.05 a restrictive fdr and in terms of where it is it's on the far right fdr so we still have tumeric is associated significantly associated with lower glucose you can see that the fdr is less than 0.05 lower alkaline phosphatase and lower high sensitivity c reactive protein on the other hand it's still significally associated with lower platelets which is going in the wrong direction so we give it a red arrow so here even after including a restrictive fdr of less than 0 05 we've got three correlations going in the right direction and one in the wrong for a fdr and body weight adjusted net turmeric association score of plus two all right what about black pepper so using the same approach black pepper after accounting for body weight and using that restrictive fdr is still still significantly associated with lower glucose and lower hscrp but also lower red blood cells which is going in the wrong direction so here we have two greens and one red for a net association score by the weight adjusted net association score which includes that restrictive fdr of plus one so now we can address that question are turmeric and black pepper bad for health and we've seen that whether using unadjusted correlations or body weight adjusted associations or body weight adjusted associations including an a restrictive fdr less than 0.05 in each of those cases the net correlative or association score has been positive in other words tumeric and black pepper are potentially positive for health at least in my case based on the datadriven analysis that i've shown here in terms of its association for these 26 biomarkers all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out
