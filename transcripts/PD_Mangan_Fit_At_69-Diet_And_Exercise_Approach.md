## Transcript

Hey everyone today's guest is pety mangan pety is 69 years old and is arguably one of the fittest 69 year olds on the planet as shown in the thumbnail he practices what he preaches in terms of health and fitness and is a wealth of health and fitness related info which will'll jump into today so with that welcome uh to the channel pd thank thanks a lot mike thanks for inviting me and thanks for thanks for the kind words yeah i mean most people think about 69 and then to look at you you don't look or sound or act like a 69y old so i think it's great well well great i mean i you know it's hard to know what 69 is supposed to feel like and uh you know so i i get up every morning i'm moving around just like normal and and you know here i am so i i don't know i when when i think about being 69 years old i think wow how did i get here um but obviously it just happens so yeah but one of the memes you posted i think bill gates how old is bill gates he's he's 68 so yeah so he's nine months younger than me or something like that yeah so that that's probably closer to what people think of as 68 69 you know uh rather than the fitness side of it right so so i want to peel all of the layers back i want to dig deep into the details right so i want to start off with your workout approach right so frequency intensity duration even how you you go about like workout to workout which movements to include um do you have standardized i'm listing like all of the questions right away so so let's take take us through a normal workout so which do you have a set um set days during the week when when you work out um no i don't um generally um i well currently i am working out once every four days so the day of the week varies um and if i um am not particularly feeling it on a particular day i do not hesitate to take an extra rest day so my my approach to training is what might be called uh brief infrequent but intense exercise um so one thing here is that you know speaking speaking generally when when uh you know the public thinks about exercise and so on is um they conflate exercise with physical activity so when i talk about exercise i mean training to get fitter physical activity is basically anything else that isn't just sitting or sleeping um so so as far as the exercise goes yes i train about once every four days my workouts last me at the most 30 minutes minutes uh when i see the when i see the clock on the gym wall and i and i see that i've actually hit 30 minutes i know it's time to clear out um so what do i do in these workouts i'm doing strength training obviously but um this type of strength training that i do resistance training it's known as high-intensity training um i'm you know certainly not the inventor of it um it involves doing compound exercises so compound exercises are those exercises that uh exercise large groups of muscle bas basically you know technically any exercises uses more than one set of joints as a compound exercise so let's say a chest press is a compound exercise so i do those and i do them to failure momentary muscular failure which means that you do repetitions of the exercise always in good form until you get to the point where you can't do another rep um or even more specifically you can't even move the weight or resistance anymore at all when when i get to that point then i'm done it is one set only of each exercise then what i do is i move to the next exercise with minimal rest in between b basically i try not to rest at all but in a in a regular gym you know there's a certain amount of time where you got to go walk over to the next exercise station sometimes someone is occupying the one you want so you got to go find another one this kind of thing but the idea is basically uh little time between exercises so this part of the training is the you know basically cardiovascular component here so as you get going into this workout you'll find that you have a pretty elevated heart rate you're breathing hard through this workout so you go through the uh the workout this way then so i do the large compound exercises i do no more than two different exercises for each muscle group so just one set of each exercise but possibly two exercises for a muscle group um my my workout varies a little bit depending on how i'm feeling about it that day um then towards the end of my workout um i might do a few isolation exercises like biceps curls triceps pull downs this kind of thing i always end my workout with a metabolic finisher so i want to be sure that i have have gotten the best cardiovascular conditioning i can out of this workout typically when i'm going through the workout doing doing the actual uh uh resistance training my heart rate will be you know anywhere you know when i stop and check after an exercise anywhere from say you know 132 up to 144 during the workout then so i then when i do the metabolic finisher and typically what i do for that finisher is i get on a stationary cycle i put it at a pretty high level of resistance and i start pedaling until i basically can't continue and usually that's 20 to 25 seconds somewhere in there based on the resistance i put it on when i get off the this metabolic finisher my heart rate gets pretty close to its maximum uh at my age my calculated maximum heart rate is something in the something in on the order of 168 um so i get up pretty close to that so that's my workout then i i kind of carry myself out of the gym and go home and that's that's that's it all right so the first exercise is what like you get there you're doing the bench press you're doing deadlift what's the first exercise you're doing right so that does vary yes sometimes i will start with deadlifts so that uh i if one is doing deadlifts it is a good idea to start with it because this is an exercise you do with free weights and your form is very important um a few years back i was very much into uh increasing my one rep max on the deadlift uh you know so like at one time i've deadlift deadlifted over 300 pounds which for you know lots of people do more than that don't get me wrong but for me it was a lot um but i don't do that anymore i am very conscious of preventing injury this this is just the most important thing in exercise you got to you get to got to just start with this as your basis for exercise don't get hurt that's the number one priority anyway yes i often start with deadlifts um and i'll do a set of deadlifts um basically to failure um failure is a little bit different in an exercise like that because of what i mentioned you're using free weights you always want to stay in good form so when i feel like i can't do another one you know if my form is breaking down i stop um then i might proceed to chinups uh and again i'll do those to failure one thing that i do in most of my exercises is uh uh what are known as set extension techniques so basically there there are two of them drop set and rest paw in a chin up since i'm using my own body weight and i can't change my body weight i use rest paw so i might get 15 chinups till the point where i can't pull myself up anymore then i'll stop and rest up to about 10 seconds and do another rep and i'll do that several times um with this this other set extension technique uh drop set this is more appropriate if you're working out on a machine because you can change the weight very easily uh usually with a pin just takes a second or two so you get to the point where you can't push that lever or pull as the case may be the ever anymore then you drop the weight say 10 to 15% do another rep in good form i can do that i might do that several times um so yeah so then let's say i'll do i'll do the uh deadlifts uh do chinups then um on a on a day that i don't start with deadlifts i might go to the leg press uh and do a set of those and then i will do i will do chest press dips um i'll do an overhead press machine overhead press and then maybe also uh uh dumbbell lateral raise for the shoulders also uh chinups chinups are an exercise that um works the lats and and back muscles and so i also do a seated row uh also works the back um at that point i've got most of my compound exercises done so like i said it does vary a little bit but that that's basically it and then i'll go do uh say a set of biceps curls um i like to do shrugs as well that works the traps um once in a while i'll do a set of triceps pull down something like that and then i'll go to my metabolic finisher so in terms of uh so deadlift for example you're not it's it's got to be submax because you can't be going to failure at you know you can't and you can't it's probably not a good idea to jump straight to like 220 or you know whatever you're doing work sets at 180 there's got to be some warmup there right well yeah well yes and no so you're totally correct about um you know not being a you know a totally a maximal effort on the deadlift because like i said i'm very conscious about preventing injury i don't want my form to break break down and i often will do a warmup you know a few warm-up reps for the deadlift however regarding warmup generally well i don't do them for any other exercise so so so basically the idea is that for you know people do a warmup largely because they want to prevent injury if they're lifting a you know a heavy weight they do a warmup so you know everything everything's in working order and they and and then they do their main set the thing is in in my way of training we're not lifting or moving a weight that on the first rep or two has the potential to injure us right so you know the the the stress of or the or the the uh stimulus to building muscle comes from continued reps and going to failure so con in conventional weight training you would see a lot of people doing say a set of three to five reps um at a pretty heavy weight and and so if somebody can only do a set of exercises say from three to five times they're generally using a pretty heavy weight that has the potenti potential for injury so i am not doing that so then you've got to know what your one rep max is in order to scale it back to have a weight sufficient enough to induce gains you know strength and and muscle mass gains while at the same time you know uh being heavy enough to provide that stimulus right so you've got to know you one rep max in that deal and then scale it back so do you know approximately where you're training relative to your one rep max so so actually i don't um the way that i uh do this is that um i select a weight and of course by now you know i'm i'm used to doing this so i have a you know pretty good idea of what weight i'm going to use every time i hop on a machine and i'm always trying to either increase my weight or my reps um because i'm you know always pushing it pushing to failure when you push to failure you are always training against the limits of your strength strength so at least in theory you should always be making progress um so what i do is i try to uh i select a weight such that i get to failure somewhere between about 45 and 90 seconds of doing the exercise anywhere in there so if i can't get to 45 seconds of course i'm not sitting there with you know looking at my watch or anything like that but i do slow reps yeah and so i have a good idea how long each rep takes and and then so i try to do it so i hit failure somewhere between 45 and 90 seconds if i can't hit 45 seconds then i'm i'm using too much weight if i can keep doing it 90 seconds or longer then i need to add some weight so i get to failure in less than 90 seconds so are you doing that specifically because of atp cp uh energy metabolism and if you go beyond like you know you get past 3 minutes now you're on aerobic metabolism right right exactly when you when you get up into several minutes of doing this yeah you're you're it's it's more like a form of aerobic training than really uh you know anerobic or strength training so how many reps is it i mean i've seen you do i think like 225 20 reps i mean is it you're generally doing 20 reps for each of the compound movements within that 90 second frame um no it it isn't that many um it you know it it depends some of the um some of the machines that i use seem to be more conducive to slower reps others are not for example in a seated row where where i'm pulling this way i can pretty easily you know just maintain tension in you know an 8c up 8c down seven or eight seconds something like that where others i find myself doing them a bit faster like let's say a biceps curl probably probably no more than 5 seconds up 5 seconds down something like that so it it does vary i'm not but it i don't think there's anything that i do that's as as much as 20 reps so it's time under tension it's a combination of reps and time under tension right so right right exactly it's it's time under tension i mean technically reps you know the number of reps doesn't matter it's all about time under detention i mean i've i've seen a really uh uh you know some some people um you know believe in very slow reps and i i've seen uh an interesting video um of a guy who was training with doug mcguff and he did a his chin up was i i believe it was 60 seconds up 60 seconds down so he did one rep but he was doing that for close to two minutes yeah but then then the there's like a balance between slow strength and then explosive power right so if you're training i get the time under tension and time under tension is going to be good for muscle mass and even strength i wonder how that translates where you know if your time under tension at a sufficient load is so great that now you've got real explosive power or do you need to train explosive power all the time in order to have explosive power right so right so as far as as far as um resistance training goes i i believe that um no one should ever do any explosive movements so explosive movements of course are necessary playing a sport football or soccer or you know whatever baseball anything that you know you need these quick explosive movements and and so this this uh points to another distinction uh be you know i mentioned between exercise and physic phical activity there's also a distinction between exercise and sports um and and this is you know i mean somebody might say well that's pretty obvious they're not the same thing but the thing is is that in exercise for example i mentioned don't get hurt that's you know that's top priority whereas in sports you you kind of you know you go into playing a sport knowing that yeah there are certain risks you've got to use explosive movements this kind of thing whereas in exercise i don't believe that explosive movements are necessary that they shouldn't be done now somebody might point to let's say powerlifting so this obviously involves some pretty explosive movements but again or or olympic weightlifting again powerlifting and olympic lifting are sports and certainly somebody who who who trains that way will get stronger and so on but there are more effective and safer ways of training and it's my view that the only people who should be doing powerlifting or olympic lifting are those who want to practice them as a sport if you want to exercise for strength no you shouldn't be doing those yeah that's an interesting approach i'm with you on almost everything else you know basically compound movements um you know a circuit training based approach you're getting the cardiovascular stimulus only i'm doing it for 90 minutes i could do it for longer but the fitness metrics start to look like overtrained all the time and chronic fatigue which we'll get into that too but then um but i do include clean and jerk i do include a little bit of the explosive movements um and whether that may translate into like uh you know the when you think about older age i believe me i hear you on minimizing injury risk right but when you think about older age it's a loss of you know basically explosive movement right an older person can't race across the street to get away from a car or predator right uh so if that's never trained i imagine and granted i like i like the heavy gorilla lift it up over my head and press it i mean it's like you know it's a it's a rush too so but i hear you on injury risk nothing is worse for aging than uh injury especially lower back herniated disc from deadlifting and all that stuff absolutely absolutely people have life-changing injuries in the gym and that's that's something definitely to be avoided so no uh negatives too you don't do negatives so uh well uh yeah i do negatives i mean i um on the negative portion of the rep i go just as slow so that's a negative and and if i'm on the last rep i'll try to do a very slow negative so yeah i do those ah but at a higher uh weight like for example if you're doing uh if you've maxed out on chinups and you can't do anymore sure you could do a p you know a pause and then and and do more reps and i do that too but then other times or lately i've been uh you know doing negatives where i'll literally jump up and then control the slow down so i know i've exhausted myself on the concentric and i'm purposfully exhausting myself on the ecentric and you know i'm sure you know that there's data you know overloading the ecentric phase can uh incre imp improve the concentric so no negatives within that right well well maybe a little bit but not not so specifically like like what you're talking about because as you you've got to be careful too too many negatives too often increase injury risk and then you can't train and that screws it all up right so absolutely and probably you know i i feel pretty um right now i feel pretty comfortable with the idea that i'm not going to hurt myself in the gym i've done everything possible you know to to avoid that the the real a more important risk for me you know if you want to call it a risk is overtraining and when you overtrain well you know you don't feel so good and then it takes longer to get back in the gym again all this kind of thing so i really definitely try to avoid that that's one reason when you know if i'm working out in the gym and i see that clock on the wall and i've been there 30 minutes and i know you know i bet i just i i just better get out even though i i get very enthusiastic i want to keep going but it's better for me if i just stop at that point wait before we go down the overtraining road so um in terms of uh i've just had something else there on the workouts uh injuries right so have you had injuries tendonitis herniated disc lower back all that stuff have you had injuries over the past i don't know say 20 30 years i i have yes um i've had tendonitis uh in my elbows and that went away pretty easily when i just figured out what was doing it i stopped doing that and it just went away um yeah i've hurt my back um i i don't really know how seriously i think most of the stuff were you know muscle pulls this kind of thing i i certainly don't have any kind of lingering injury i've never seen a doctor for you know for any of that kind of stuff so hopefully i you know i haven't hur hurt myself too seriously and and i guess even if i did it's it's gone now but yeah even even pulling a muscle it's painful and then you can't work out out for a while and yeah so you know even something like that definitely to be avoided and then how long have you been on this 30 minute you know twice a week how long have you been on that and then i know that evolved out if you were a runner so how long you know yeah how's that evolution been and and and do you see that being the same you know uh approach going forward indefinitely um yeah so to to to answer the the last part first yeah this is what i intend to keep doing um my um my study of high-intensity training has convinced me that this is a uh completely um adequate if i want to say or legitimate way to improve cardiovascular health that doesn't require you know long training runs or long you know bouts of whatever it is for for cardiovascular stimulus um as far as how that evolved well so that that takes us into another place but yeah i was running i ran for years and years i've i've run a couple of marathons in my life i used to go out and do a lot of lot of distance um and then um i was fairly ill for a while like i said this takes us into another thing we can talk about that if you want but i was ill and and uh for quite a few years and then when i started getting better um i decided well i'm going to try lifting some weights and and and i got into it again it was pretty tough at first but um you know joined a gym so that that's where that started about 15 years ago um and then i i trained in a conventional way for i i don't know six seven years something like that until i discovered high-intensity training and switched to that and i've been doing that ever since nice so going down to overtraining road so i guess were there times when you were it was it wasn't a 30 minute workout but it was a 60 or longer some longer workout and then you realized ah if i go above that 30 minute threshold don't have a certain amount of days in between i feel fatigued and all of the symptoms that come with overtraining a absolutely i mean i there there were times i mean i think even a typical workout back back in the day i i might be in the gym an hour and 15 minutes hour and 20 minutes something like that of course it wasn't the same in the sense that there there was some rest time between exercises and i you know i was doing multiple sets and and all this kind of thing but yeah that that kind of training um really kicked my ass i mean it it was it was i just had too many days where you know i wanted to just sit sit in my comfy chair and not get up so it's such an ego hit because like i love doing my like i said 90-minute workouts and i could do it for even longer it used to be three hours where i would just throw stuff around like a gorilla for three hours right and like in a circuit based thing but that like you said the next day i feel like i've you know gone out and it's a night of drinking so it's it's such an ego hit to have to cut it down and it like you it takes me 3 to four days to recover from that so um yeah absolutely yeah it's a big hit but i think most people aren't thinking about it like that it's everyday gym it's you know 10 sets per body part and then the next day you do a different body part and i think you know so when you think about like uh i'm sure you know the the the vibe that's all over the interwebs these days of have your v2 max as high as possible and basically train like an elite athlete to to maximize longevity which ends up being at most like seven years on average for lifespan but when you consider that exercise is well known to increase average but it doesn't get you to the maximum whether it's in animal models in comparison against calor restriction or elite athletes and you know four minute mers who get the increase in average life life expectancy but you don't see them at 115 years old so i wonder if overtraining is a component of that equation it has to be right where exercise gets you that increase in overall general health but at the same point even if you're o overtrained by some amount maybe that limits you know getting to the maximum and potentially beyond right right and i'm sure you've seen those uh u-shaped curves as far as exercise goes where you know too much exercise is bad and and and in resistance training too much exercise turns out to be not all that much um i mean there's some studies these are epidemiological studies of course but some studies where you know 60 minutes a week in the gym was basically as much as you would want to do um so yeah some you're you're right about exercise as as far as longevity goes um i mean in in animal studies and so on the exercise just doesn't seem to do all that much for for longevity certainly increases health span i mean it's it's totally totally the best thing to do is is to do the right kind of exercise and the right amount and everything definitely very healthy but as far as longevity goes um yeah it's it's not all that impressive and and yes maybe overtraining has something to do with it i mean you you see these uh you you've seen these uh studies where um you know like lifelong distance runners have the the you know scarring on the heart um there yeah what do they call that gatum late gatum enhancement um where they do these imaging studies and they have you know their heart their hearts aren't so good um because they've been just really overstressing them for a long time yeah so how many so what's your uh and maybe this is a philosophical question so do you have longevity genetics like are your parents still alive or or not how long yeah so uh so yeah kind of um so my parents are not alive no my mother died um just a few years ago at age 99 um so yeah and and so her side of the family there's some long lived i i had a great uncle that lived to be over a hundred um my father's side not so much just sort of normal um 70 70ish uh he he was he was in his 80s um when he died um and and but with but without um without modern medicine you know would have been definitely less so what do you have an expectation for how long you expect to live or is it just a matter of squeeze as much juice from the orange as you can and wherever that lands is where it lands yeah more more the ladder so you know i do think about this i as far as um okay i'm i'm 69 years old how much longer could i possibly have um like you you know very nicely said at the beginning of the show uh here that um you know i don't seem like a 69y old or look like one not like bill gates for sure so so i think wow you know if if i just keep doing this uh and and honestly i i don't think i feel all that different from what i did 10 years ago for example so if i just keep doing this um you know how long can i keep doing it i i you know obviously i don't know but [music] um when when people talk about um like say living to 120 or you get even more extreme things you hear here you know here and there right but when people talk about that i think you know like at least for myself i think nah that's not going to happen um you know it's so it's just a matter of doing what i want to do to keep myself fit and healthy and then yeah the chips are going to fall where they may really you know i i i exert as much effort towards this as i can but you know then then the rest is beyond my control have you seen any performance uh uh deficits in the gym like do you have do you know exactly all right i i i'm usually doing 20 reps for deadlifts at this or 15 reps like are you tracking your like strength over time and have you seen any decrements or is it pretty consistent for the last you know 10 15 years since you've been uh focused on it yeah yeah you know it's hard to say because like like i said i used to used to go for one rep max deadlifts for example and i don't do that anymore um for for the reasons i stated so i don't know um a few years ago let's see so i don't know how long you i don't know six seven years ago or something um i weighed about 20 pounds more than i do now and um you know when i started weightlifting i was like okay i was i was skinny and you know i wanted to put on muscle i did pretty successfully i put on muscle rapidly in the course of you know six months to a year when i started training and and i was eating appropriately or maybe inappropriately anyway i got to i got got up to about 20 pounds more than i weigh now and you know i was still training hard and everything and i mean one day i you looked at myself in the mirror and i said you know hey don't fool yourself there's a lot of body fat there um so i deliberately lost weight now did that affect my muscular strength you know i don't know i kept training obviously kept eating in the way i thought was appropriate but you know maybe it did wait so that 20 pound weight loss was how many years ago pro probably um seven eight years ago i'd say so then within the past seven to eight years would you say strength and performance during your workouts is about the same i mean granted you said you used to one reped maxes but uh if there's any way to relate how so i'm thinking you know if you can maintain strength and performance indefinitely right that's a big part of longevity right so whereas if you start to see some decrement then it's like all right what what can i do to fend this off and what's underlying that you know uh so right right right so as far as i know no i have not seen any decrement in in performance um that you know that said i'm terrible at tracking things um unlike you um but but yeah so so i i haven't been able to notice anything um i i really you know when i go to the gym i mean i i'm cranking it and um i i do sometimes think that you know like you know could i could i please have a little bit better recovery um you know that's the thing so like for for instance today today uh i worked out two days ago let's see today sunday so i worked out on friday morning um usually 48 hours after the workout is when i'm feeling it the most um you know so i so i always would like better recovery and i you know really try to like i've talked about already try to control how much work i'm doing in the gym so i don't get into that overtraining state like today for example i i wouldn't say i'm overtrained but you know maybe close we you know feeling you know not so energetic and so on um so yeah but but otherwise i i just keep doing it i think that uh i i can't tell that there's any been any uh you know diminished uh strength or anything like that that's good news so then i think you mentioned that you do like just low intensity walking on the other days and have you have you played around with i mean i can hear people that are saying coal plunge and all these things that are purported to enhance recovery which i put them in quotes because i i'm just not convinced because you know for me nothing works better than actual rest like don't stress me with sauna or i need to physically relax my heart rate for everything to to get back to normal so have like have you experimented with all right i'm just not going to leave the house today and see how that impacts you know my recovery versus i walk one mile i walk two miles do you have that in an equation almost or um um yes yes somewhat um there are there are days when i when i just say um yeah i don't think i'll go out for a walk today um unfortunately when i do that it's usually kind of too late like in other words like i'm just feeling too tired so you know i better not not do any of that um um but yeah so you know my like my walking i mean i'm not going out and doing the you know 10,000 steps you know for for time or anything like that like some people do it's more of a casual walk i just i think you know this is an interesting point about physical activity that you know in in my study of of this i think that um maybe is unappreciated or underappreciated i don't know anyway that just the idea of kind of like getting the juices flowing is really important um you know the the the amount of physical activity that um is conducive to having much lower mortality rates i you saw me post this the other day is very low yeah um so if somebody goes from sedentary to walking 30 minutes a day a few days a week you know they're getting just massive benefit out of this health benefit um so and and also you you kind of just briefly touched on this earlier what you had in your in your video a couple weeks ago about v2 max and how the these so-called elite uh elite v2 max had the you know the lowest mortality but the elite actually wasn't even all that high you know it's something that's attainable by most people that doesn't require hours and hours of of conditioning exercise conditioning a week yeah and some of that too is so when you look at the so i'm okay with the casual walk i'm doing the same exact thing like it's very low intensity on the non-workout days my whole workout routine is centered around that you know circuit training compound movement based 90-minute workout so i i'm not trying to kill myself on the other days even even with the recovery and overtraining there are day if i didn't have to expend energy on activities of life like commuting to work or parenting other things that impact stress levels which can impact recovery i could do some high intensity stuff on the day after but even there i've got to be very careful it's got to be like less than 10 minutes of like allout sprints otherwise i'm further pushing my recovery to even slower than it usually is so uh but what the point i'm trying to get at is when you look at like published studies on like 8,000 steps a day or 10,000 steps a day on like maxim maximally reducing the all cause mortality risk this is generally in people who are you know eating a poor diets and are overweight maybe they need a little bit more whereas someone who's really hitting it hard on those recovery days you don't have to go and walk three miles or four miles i don't know it's just a hypothesis but you know there's no evidence in my data whether it's blood pressure or you know lipids you know um that you know ramping it up even higher in terms of duration and frequency for exercise would be beneficial so yeah i i totally agree with you yeah that that um right e even even with um well just basically i'm just repeating your point yeah most of these people are are not eating right and you know might be overweight and so on and and yeah you just don't need all that much exercise i used to try to do um i used to try to intersperse my strength training workouts with some you know high-intensity interval training and i mean almost every time i would just push myself over the edge into you know oh man i'm way overtrained here um so i don't do a whole lot of that anymore i just you know take it take it on you know on my training days that's it and then yeah the rest of the time pretty casual stuff and let the body recover right absolutely all right so let's transition into diet right so the sun stak and steel approach so we got the steel that's the uh exercise component steak being you know a major part of the diet component so what's a normal diet like starting from when you wake up uh to when you you know what time do you wake up what time do you go to sleep what's the eating pattern you know in between okay okay well um these these days i'm getting up pretty early because uh i i uh coach clients and some of them uh i they're from all over the world so like if somebody's in uh australia for example i i i mean i talked to an australian just the other day and it was uh 5:00 am my time um 17 hours time difference um so so i'm up pretty early um i drink copious amounts of tea um that that's that's my uh drink of choice and uh sometimes i will do some intermittent fasting um you know it kind of kind of depends but um i would say generally speaking i i probably wouldn't have anything to eat till i've been up for five or six hours something like that um and i eat i protein and um i emphasize protein uh at breakfast you know i might have something like uh uh greek yogurt like non-fat greek yogurt or something like that or some cottage cheese or maybe uh maybe some eggs that sort of thing very similar things for lunch i try to keep it light dinner is typically yeah some kind of meat like a steak with some vegetables salad maybe something like that i have a couple glasses of wine um yeah and that about covers it i mean it's it's you know pretty similar from day to day and and you know and i like it so your eating window basically starts at some 10 10 in the morning then if you're up at 5 10 11 yeah that yeah that's fair enough i mean it's not the same every day of course but yeah something like that right and then ends at about what time um probably probably before 6:00 p.m. So 10 all right 8 hour eating window and then on workout days when do you fit the workout is the workout in the morning you know afternoon how when do you right right i go i i do go early in the morning for you know actually a couple of reasons well one like i just said i have clients and and i you know if it's on uh you know a weekday i often have to just squeeze the workout in and fortunately because my workouts are short and the gym is only 3 minut it's drrive for me that's pretty easy to do um uh and and yeah and then of course if if i do work out i'm not going to be fasting afterwards i get some protein afterwards in some form or or other um yeah so let's see i don't know what did i answer the question was there something else there yeah so the workouts are basically in the morning fasted and then uh you come home and then do you continue to fast after on purpose or then as soon as you get home it's it's get food in the you know food in right right exactly it's it's get some food in um right after so yeah that that's what i do voraciously right i mean it's uh you know i i look forward to it after a workout i've got it ready to go cooked and everything abs absolutely i i usually f uh or i often find that i you know weigh a pound or two more the day after my workout because i've eaten so much on workout days i'm so hungry ah so you're that's right you're not you don't so you're just you're not counting calories at all it's just completely satiety and right yeah interesting wow i can't do that i wish i i could do that and and auto regulate but unfortunately that doesn't work for me h uhuh well you know the like like i've said to people the only the only uh app that i use in fitness is a scale um so that's you know basically how i'm judging things it's interesting too you know when i step on the scale and it kind of gives me um a a general idea of like am i really hungry so like if i step on the scale and i'm like a pound or two more than i think i should be i then i i think oh well you know yeah i guess i'm not really very hungry am i and then so i'll fast a little bit ah so ah so then so that so do you weigh yourself every day is that is that a part of oh that's so if you see if you see the scale weight is a little bit higher that morning then that's the motivation maybe to eat a little bit less that that day right yes interesting absolutely but you've got to do that over a long enough period of time where it's like all right yesterday i had more salt than usual it's a salt thing it's not a calorie thing this is this is true i mean and and especially if i've uh maybe had a few carbs i eat generally pretty low carb but if i've eaten more than usual and of course you know body water comes with eating carbs and so yeah um you usually i can tell what's going on there you know especially like if we've gone out to eat or something like that and i've had some things that i don't usually have and then yeah so it's not a never based approach for some of the more quotequote fun stuff it's just a limit that stuff as much as possible you know right right rest restaurants like i tell my clients restaurants are terrible for weight loss absolutely terrible i mean in theory it's possible you go to a restaurant and if you're really good you can find something on the menu and stick to the plan and all this kind of stuff but in practice you know you go to a restaurant you're with friends or family you have a drink or two and then it's like ah who cares you know i'm just g to have whatever i want so yeah restaurants are not good for that and they're in the business of like making sure you you know pay as much as possible by satisfying you as much as possible so it's going to be hyper palatable even though it's not you know ultr processed right so absolutely yes and that that's probably you know where i think we agree the most is ultra processed foods you know now granted i'm not a never on that too but you've got to be really careful with it you know to include it at all because if you know if it's frequency you know the the if the frequency of ultr processed food is more than a certain amount now you're messing up the signals between the gut and brain and you can't turn it off and you can't auto regulate you know so never on ups for you or that's just it's a very rare thing yeah i i i'd say just very rare so there probably there are probably few things not too many things that are just never for me but you know some something like a dessert well that's not strictly speaking ultra process but let's say uh uh but but but let's say a nice dessert i mean i'm probably only having something like that a few times a year yeah nice so so uh that gets to uh like calorie uh calorie restriction like how what's your i don't even know how tall you are what's your body weight so i i'm uh about 5'9 and maybe 5'9 and a half on a good day uh and i weigh about 150 pounds ah so you you may be some aspect of cr i mean bmi what's that bmi it's probably like 23 is 20 it's it's in the it's above 22 but it's like 22.3 or something like that yeah interesting yeah all right yeah so yeah i i i've wondered about that myself um um if i kind of fall into that category of i mean obviously i'm not restricting calories for one thing i'm not doing it deliberately and for another thing the people who are doing it deliberately are even you know as you know a lot lighter you know like bmi of 19 this kind of thing right so i'm not anywhere near there but yeah i' i've i've wondered about that does that have something to do yeah i'm in good health and i you know we talked about you know age and all that kind of stuff is this have something to do with it i do think that um you know i i like i said i'm terrible at tracking but i look at overall and i think you know yeah maybe i don't really eat all that much so maybe in terms so when you like you said when you think of uh calor restriction yeah there are people that are like 18.5 and below which to me is way too far in the extreme but yeah when considering you were 20 pounds heavier that's some form of calorie rtion that you are able to maintain a 20 lb lighter uh body weight so i think there's a pretty good marker i don't know if you've measured uh sex hormone binding globulin shbg that's dramatically elevated for people on cr it's elevated by people who exercise you know frequent uh frequent regular exercisers but it's almost double that for people who are on cr so i don't know if you've measured it's it it i have but it's been a long time so i you know i couldn't tell you what it is currently um you know my my i will tell you so this is an indication i mean last time i had blood work it's been over a year um but i had a testosterone done and my so you know i'm sure you know all about the relation between shbg and free testosterone and so on my free testosterone was out of range high ah so that get yeah shbg probably very low right ah interesting so probably not then that's interesting wow yeah yeah i guess yeah i'm on the other side of that coin right now where my shb shb bg is double the reference range my total testosterone on the last test was very high like 970 but my free is right on that border of you know uh what's considered low so i've actually increased my calories by a small amount uh because you know so uh free testosterone impacts urethal poesis which could impact total levels of reven blood cells and hemoglobin so i've actually started to see a pattern in my data of a trend down for red blood cells and hemoglobin as i've been cutting calories sequentially test over test so that argues that my current bmi of around 22 may actually be too low so the people who are on more extreme extreme cr i can only imagine like i don't know that they're doing it that that carefully so right right yeah that's interesting um yeah the the i i've seen in in a number of clients who were were um exercising like mad that they had you know low free testosterone even low total total testosterone high shbg um i mean i t i talked to a young guy uh he you know he's like 20 23 24 years old or something and he was saying wow i can't can't put on muscle and what's going on there and so i talked to him and i mean he he was like in the gym two hours every day all you know all week long i'm like well gez no wonder you know your testosterone's low and yeah overtraining it goes back to the overtrained phenotype right so right yeah and and you would think that more is better where you're just moving your body but yeah so all right so the third component and i should mention people who don't know you're if i were you i just as a suggestion i'd put it on a t-shirt sun steak and steel i mean it's a great model right so uh so yeah so we've got this uh steak and steel so the other aspect is sun which uh so no sunscreen no sunscreen ever no sunscreen ever um but i i guess i i would have to uh uh maybe maybe people get the wrong idea so it's not it's not like i'm spending hours out in the sun lying out there every day nothing like that it's more like i mean like i was out there today lying out a little bit i was out there for 20 minutes i mean it was so all that depends on you know time of day season of the year all this kind of thing so i'm not i'm not you know laying out uh hours a day or anything like that it's more well a couple of things i would say one is that it's more about don't be afraid of it like like so many people are you know that we've been taught to be oh yeah you know if you're going to be out there five minutes you better have your sunscreen on this kind of thing um the other is that it's more or less shorthand for just get outside get some fresh air move around you know and yeah get some sun so that's that's what that's all about yeah so i'm in the same boat 20 minutes 20 to 30 minutes um it used to be an hour and i started to notice some like bleaching you know that you get like sunspots that bleach and i was like ah this is too much which sucks because it's fun to be in the sun now i'm not trying to go the opposite extreme in no sun but that's i dramatically underrated you know especially with sunscreens everywhere my 15 year old's like i'm going to lather up and i'm like you're you need to get sun exposure it's we evolve getting sun you know um even you know brian johnson probably is the most famous for this where he's you know never getting in the sun which i mean that's just disagree with him there you know so yeah yeah totally i yeah i agree i i think i've heard you say but most people are deficient especially older adults so you know it's hugely potentially hugely important to to get that right so right right absolutely and and and also you know be being in the sun as you know um uh it it does a lot more than just uh you know produce vitamin d in the skin so increases nitric oxide levels and and has all you know these other benefits and then not only that um usually i mean if you're lying in the sun you're getting some grounding which i believe in also so reduces inflammation and so on so i think those are those are good you you get into you get into um you know the whole marginal benefit thing like how you know how like if i am who i am how much benefit am i getting from uh say you know grounding every day or something like that well you know who knows um it certainly can't hurt the average person could probably get a lot of benefit out of it so wait grounding is basically where you just bare feet on grass or and then what is it it's something about the electrons in the ground i don't know what's what's the me right right so um yeah so it's bare feet on the grass or you know if you uh also uh if you're on concrete that's in contact with the earth that works as well um and so what it does at least one of the main things it seems to do is yeah you you're um getting electrons from the earth and this increases the zeta potential of red blood cells and so it lowers blood viscosity so therefore it improves uh circulation and and um and then it reduces inflammation as well there have been studies on this now whether whether the reducing inflammation part has anything to do with the zeta potential of red blood cells i don't know um but but the uh yeah the the zeta the zeta potential is important i mean if you look up uh for example um you know studies about uh you know the arthy sedimentation rate and mortality you know you find that people who have um high said rates have higher mortality and it's because their blood you know red blood cells are all just clumping together so you don't want that to happen so that anyway that's one thing at least that grounding does so grounding can reduce the esr reduce uh or or the zeta potential has has to do with if the red blood cells are i guess they're negative right right so the the the zeta potential is the fact that um each red cell has a uh negative electric charge around it therefore um they repel each other yeah and and so uh grounding increases the zeta potential and so they have less of a tendency to stick together so is there published data that uh grounding is associated with reduced all cause mortality risk has has that been published that i don't think so i've never seen anything like that but it's the hypothesis that it should lead to the less tendency for the the red blood cells the clump less cling and all that all the bad stuff that goes with that right all right so i have i have all right so since we're on biomarkers right so i want to so the lean mass hyperr right so let me pose the situation right so you've got someone who's very low carb and uh as expected you know triglycerides come down ldl goes up hdl goes up right so you have a low tg to hdl ratio ldl very high high total cholesterol the the assumption would be that in that case someone may improv their metabolic status where now glucose is low hba1c is low but what if that's not the case what if it's uh what if it's just um you know glucose is over 100 hba1c close close to six in conjunction with the lipids being in those directions so what would you what would you do in that situation well in that situation i'd say that person is likely not metabolically healthy um so you you know in a metabolic healthy person you'd expect to see hemoglobin a1c closer to five yeah um and and so um and if they had a high the ldl part so this is i suppose what's of most interest here um for one thing it appears that oxidized ldl is the important part of it that if it's not oxidized it really doesn't matter and um and then you know of course lately they've been getting into at all the apo stuff and the same thing goes here because apo b is a a marker of small dense ldl particles which are associated with poor metabolic health metabolic syndrome and so on so um i i mean i would expect for you know for somebody to go for someone that went on a low carb diet to see improvements in all those markers but in any case so the way you describe it that's not good metabolic health and so this is what i believe is the crucial component of cardiovascular risk yeah so how would i'm not for me it's not i mean i hear you on the ldl but it's more of okay if someone has gone low carb and they see all of the things you know and they're not over uh overweight or obese um you know so how would you improve metabolic health so that they can reduce glucose and reduce hba1c within the context of going low car yeah so um well of course uh one thing is exercise of course um whe you know whether they're doing the right amount of of exercise or any any exercise at all um people uh who are uh of normal weight often have relatively high body fat and low muscle mass so just the fact that someone is is in a normal bmi range doesn't mean that they have good body composition and that they have good good metabolic health in that way and then another thing that i've have seen uh a lot in talking to my clients and this is not uh this is not hard to believe but unfortunately in my opinion in you know ketogenic and low carb diet circles that promote ingesting a whole lot of fat um and and they they think that this is uh basically um you know a free food or harmless or however you want to put it and so some of these people are in in you know doing you know massive amounts of of fat i mean i've had i've had clients for example that have come to me and they're drinking bulletproof coffee for example and and you know like i think why would anyone want to do that you know i mean not not if you're aiming for weight loss certainly um so you know whe whether all that dietary fat could you know be involved in having a higher hemoglobin a1c or high glucose i you know i don't really know but it could certainly be a factor in not being able to lose weight for example or you know lose excess body fat is it possible that that that uh increasing carbs in that t in that case and i don't mean like pastries and cookies and all this other stuff but like just real food you know maybe uh the fiber helps to you know the gut microbiome get involved to reduce uh you know to improve insulin sensitivity there's published data on that um like i hear you there may be people who thrive on low carb whether it's high fat or not um and then glucose is low uh hba w see as low and they're not you know and they're exercising you know but for people who are high you know it's a matter of trying to titrate the dose and people who may not you know respond to generally you know the lower carb diet where now you've got some other metabolic issues that shouldn't be there well maybe it's there's stuff in the diet they can change or maybe try to get leaner well right so you know i'm sure you're probably aware of the you know the paper by nick norwitz where he ate ate oreos and it brought his ldl from very high way you know way down and it was more effective for him than when he took a statin um and so yeah but but i think so yeah so so if somebody's on a very low carb diet and they have high ldl yes they they could potentially um you know bring it down by eating some more carbs then this is the lean mass hyper responder phenotype but not but not the l ld ldl side of it i'm more interested in the glucose hba1c you know because you're going to get the i hear you in in nick's experiment you know you're going to produ ldl but ldl you know uh maybe maybe it's meaningless it's within the context of insulin resistance and inflammation that maybe now it's it's a big player right so right so so for the aside from the lipids like uh you know i don't know if i looked at his paper but i i don't know if that it was in there but did his glucose or hb1c or insulin levels change when he added yeah i don't i i i don't know i don't think that was in his paper um i i you know one thing that happens in and uh i've seen this in myself is this the so-called dawn effect with blood glucose so i've had i've i've gone in and had a you know fasting glucose done it was like 105 and i've seen like for example uh sha baker uh posted his you know this is a few years ago i think but yeah he had like you know it was 120 or something like this and so the idea here is is the dawn effect the idea that when you get up in the morning and and cortisol rises and your blood glucose rises and and this is especially uh um especi especially happens if people are under stress and by stress i don't mean necessarily you know something horrific but just like getting up in the morning driving off to work you know rush rush rush i mean so like when i had my 105 gluc glucose i was working in a clinical lab and you know i had gotten up in the morning rush rush drive off to work my commute to work get in the lab i'm running around in the morning getting all my work done then i finally after two or three hours there i had a break and i said said to one of my co-workers hey can you you know draw my blood you know so obviously i was all you know all this stress so maybe that had something to do with it yeah so hb1c maybe uh a better measure in that case right because then it would be more reflective of the longer term changes i think sea i think sean rationalized that his insulin levels were low i think it like three milli use which in even in combination with a glucose of 100 would be a low homa and technically insulin sensitive but uh yeah i i too work with clients so i i do have one that where uh his um you know high high fat high low carb low carb diet basically keto diet and um glucose glucose you know older than age expected hb1c older than age expected you know and then it's trying to figure out what can we add in to to you know you know to solve to square the circle there you know what i mean so i i think that um one you know what the resolution to that is i'm not so sure but one one an interesting thing to do would be to get a non-fasting glucose test and if it's lower than the fasting then i think you can you can very probably say that you know this this fasting glucose is this dawn effect it's an anomaly and overall maybe it doesn't matter yeah all right so let's let's shift into your probably your most famous biomarker being the iron you know dumping iron if people don't know you've written six books that's one of them dumping iron um so what's so the i get the iron story that it's a part of hemoglobin and red blood cells but there may be people who aren't familiar so how would you how would you you know pitch the iron story in aging okay wrote a paper too that got published so right right so um let's see where do i start so iron is necessary is a necessary element for all living things and as far as human beings go uh go we have uh finely tuned uh iron regulatory mechanisms hormones and so on that regulate the absorption of iron from our food so at least in theory if somebody is very metabolically healthy everything else is right when people get to a certain uh level of body iron stores basically the regulatory system will really kind of shut down the absorption of iron so you can keep that in fine-tune in practice many people are not metabolically healthy and there's there are sources of iron that um we we uh didn't necessarily have before you know for example flour and cornmeal in the united states is mostly iron fortified and people take multivitamins with iron supplements and you know this kind of thing um so the result is is that um generally speaking uh people's iron iron level body iron stores as indicated by the mark fertin rises with age and this has been shown to be associated with all kinds of ill health and higher mortal ity and so on um this this whole line of reasoning and investigation basically started when um the late jerome sullivan several decades ago was thinking about well why do women have such lower heart uh rates of heart disease um and you know at the time and for all i know maybe still now a lot of people are are saying well they have estrogen and various things that you know prevent heart disease and he thought oh well gee women have much you know premenopausal women have much lower stores of body iron their fertin is low and you know in middle age like uh you know let's say between the age of for 40 and 50 um you men have uh about five something like four to five times the levels of fertin that women do and they also have about four or five times the rates of heart attacks as women do at that age um so that's where where it all started there's been a lot of research iron is important um for instance in cancer cancer is a rapidly growing tissue anything that is growing requires iron for growth um some many uh to cells upregulate transferin receptors so that they can accumulate a lot of iron uh another side of this evidence is is that um and again this this research goes back a few decades and there there's more recent research too um that blood donors have better health than non-blood donors now of course you run into a big problem there which is the healthy donor effect because you got to be healthy to donate blood and and not not only that probably people who don't feel so healthy or not even going to try um but this is so this has been looked at as well um you know try trying to stat statistically account for the healthy donor effect to you know to see how much of this is real and it certainly does app appear to be real there was a paper that came out a few years ago that said that um so one thing they do to account for the healthy donor effect is they look at for example they compare frequent donors with non-frequent donors so you know this this doesn't necessarily account for the whole thing but at least you're not comparing just blood donors to non-donors so anyway they they looked at this and found that um it it it was something like ev every blood donation beyond two donations a year was associated with 75% lower mortality rate i think i got that right um so this this was trying to account for the healthy donor effect they've also looked at things like um like in some countries people are um um not allowed to give blood after the age of 65 so they compare current blood donors with former blood donors and so anyway that that's the whole thing with iron and and so um the idea is oh and also let me let me add another part to this um um therapeutic photomy in other words bleeding people blood liting um does all kinds of good things for metabolic syndrome and fatty non-alcoholic fatty liver disease all this kind of thing so iron is a very reactive metal um and and you know can cause oxidative stress does all kinds of um all kinds of bad things so um so keeping iron body iron levels low is uh in in in a low normal range i should say is the thing to do for good health and longevity so it it's not just looking at iron by itself but iron with uh fertin or is it could you look at iron by itself as a biomarker right so so b basically no in most cases you have to look at fertin now so this is this brings up an interesting point because the iron that is causing trouble in the body that causes damage and so on is what they would call free iron or la laile iron in other words this is iron that is not bound by the protein molecule fertin so the you know the the question is well so if you uh donate blood for example you lower your fertin does that um but the in in my book the i use the analogy that um for example if you look at dynamite okay so dynamite is you know allegedly if it's just sitting there you know it's all safe you know until until you do something to it like i don't know light a fuse whatever they do to dynamite uh um it's okay but you know you wouldn't necessarily want to store a case of dynamite in your house um and and so that's the analogy i use with fertin so if if the if the iron atoms are locked into the fertin mo molecule then there's no problem but in practice this whole system becomes disregulated um one of uh the late dr leo zakari who wrote the preface to my book and he he had done a lot of work on iron um he he talked to me about um for for instance um uh f the fertin molecule can become glycosilated if dur with you know if somebody has high high glucose excursions or generally high blood sugar the you know it become it can become glycosilated and then it just doesn't work properly and it leaks iron so um so in in that sense um yeah get you know getting the fertin down to a low normal level is helpful in that way so probably looking at both right not looking at only at iron levels and blood but also fertin probably measuring both would be a good idea because if you only have the iron you don't know the fertin and if you only have the fertin you don't know the iron right so well well so so if you're looking at um if you're looking at serum iron um yes it does become disregulated ated sometimes but but the damage of um of the iron is going on inside cells uh and and so you know this this gets really technical into sort of uh you know the kind of territory a hematologist would be looking at you know iron and transfer and and uh total iron saturation and all these kind of things um so um there there are number of studies that you know that have been done i don't know a few decades ago where they were looking at um what were they looking at transferin i guess or iron saturation but this is just not as if somebody has a high iron saturation that generally means they're absorbing too much iron uh and um you know so like they they might have hemocromatosis or at least you know some gene variant that is causing them to absorb too much iron ah interesting so then it's maybe it's not just looking at iron as a biomarker and fittin but total iron binding capacity right because if that's high right you've got a lot of iron being released from hemoglobin and wherever else it's coming from and that's indicative of cellular damage and you know for whatever reason whether it's microbes causing it or your cells are just dysfunctional right so right right just think wow yeah so so what i i didn't even think i was going to bring in microbes into it but do you think microbes when considering uh you know uh g gut leak um there could be a blood micro microbiome that maybe just overgrowth during aging do you think that that's a component in the iron equation since microbes compete with human cells for iron where um yeah that's interesting and and you know i'm not sure i i only have an idea or two about that you know one thing that i found so interesting was recently i i i learned this is is so two um two genera of bacteria that are gener generally considered probiotic namely lactobacillus and bifido bacterium do not require iron at all they are like one of the very few species you know genera you know life forms whatever we want to call it uh that do not require iron and you know it it seemed curious to me that the fact that they don't require iron and they are considered healthy for the gut you know does is that related um one thing i i could say is is that as far as um you know the gut goes well the liver is the first organ to you know to see basically see the contents you know the what's coming in from the gut and of course we get you know fatty liver and soros and things like that iron is involved in in that um definitely you know it's free iron of course um an interesting thing kind of as an aside you know a lot of people don't know this but being on twitter i'm sure you do you see all the stuff about seed oils yeah um right and and what they're doing and as far as they they polyunsaturated fats are very reactive molecules and and and lead to uh you know oxidative stress molecular damage and so on so what's going on there well in at least in many cases it appears to be it's a combination of polyunsaturated fats and free iron the free iron is reacting with the polyunsaturated fats to create this problem um this is exactly um you know you you know about this too uh lipo fusin um so you know this is a so-called age pigment that bus up in inside uh lomes and just basically totally messes up the cell it's been called the garbage catastrophe of aging because it's garbage that the cell can't get rid of what's lipop fusin made of it's made of polyunsaturated fats and iron and then and and then it it it messes up the protein molecules and then just forms all this junk and so it's yeah iron and polyunsaturated fats that's that's what causes the buildup of lipop fusin so microbes potentially playing a role in that process outside of the lactobacillus and the fitto bacteria um so so for example for example if you know like in the gut if uh there is there can be like a you know the degradation of the mucus layer so now the bacteria can get into the epithelial cells so could there be a situation where the micro microbes had infected a cell and you know it's in inside the cell you you know the and maybe that's a part of autoimmunity i mean this is speculation right but uh could there be a process where microbes are competing for iron and then there's cellular damage as a result iron is released uh as a part of that process which then is a cascade of you know horrors for the body right so right right so yes um for one thing um well what's interesting is that um yeah so so all all bacteria microorganisms apparently other than lactobacilus and bifidobacterium all require iron and if if we're talking about pathogenic bacteria that invade the human body iron is absolutely the limiting element for their growth they absolutely have to have iron so they have developed ways to acquire iron and we have developed ways to withold it from them this has been called an evolutionary arms race where where it you know like our transferin molecules for example have grown to become ever you know to ever to hold iron ever tighter and tighter and tighter you know so that bacteria can't get them and then they the the bacteria or other microorganisms have developed ways like sedero fores so these are you know that the the proteins and that they secrete into their environment that grab iron um so uh um whether you know whether that's uh well another thing is that when people are uh critically ill or um or they have severe injuries th you know this can lead to the release of free iron and then you have the bacteria or other micro microorganisms swooping in because they've got all this free iron and then you you know you see infections and so on um whether that dynamic has anything to do with you know disordered iron metabolism you know as most people would experience it i couldn't say yeah i don't know that that's the yeah that's the next step in this evolution of the story right are microbes causing it uh you know causing the the you know the leak but who knows right so right all right so what would if you had if you had to change parts of your approach uh you know what if you had to go back and tell your younger self you know what would you change like in and two in two ways one the the pre-runner the pre you know the listening to mainstream health advice i was brainwashed by that nonsense too eat low fat i was going 10% of my total calories and it wasn't until i started tracking diet and looking at correlations was like oh man that's not true at all that's actually terrible for you know um a lot of biomarkers so um so so in two phases like i guess before you you had that awakening before you unplugged and i heard you say you know red pill the red pill also was in total recall right so we got to be careful we got to be careful about people throwing around red pills because maybe people saying the red pill stuff maybe trying to throw you know a blue pill disguised as a red pill but anyway so so in two in two parts with the the pre you know basically autodidact which i have the greatest respect for that level of of thinking which i think you in that boat and very few people are unfortunately i hope that more people would would be on the self-taught you know uh uh a road um so before the you know the the the runner the pd runner and then over the past you know say 10 years since you've been more on this track so are the things that you would change and you wish you changed earlier on relative to to now well yes um so you know i wish i had been training the way i am um a long time ago um you know that said i i really did enjoy running i mean there's something like when you when you go out and run 10 miles and when you get into it it's just this this feeling it's it's euphoric yeah um you know so i i really did enjoy that but i don't think it's the best way to exercise anymore um what i really wish that i had done differently was um not gone near any of that vegetarian vegan nonsense um protein and particularly animal protein is just so important and you know generally speaking vegetarians are ve you know and especially vegans don't get enough and you know i practice both of those for a while because yeah i believed all the mainstream stuff oh don't have saturated fat it's going to clog your arteries and kill you and heart disease you know you asked me earlier about my family well my dad's side of the family heart disease runs in the family they all had it you know including my father and so this was always a big concern of mine like you know i don't want to get that um you know so i you know this this was the message coming down from mainstream media or mainstream health sources that you know you should don't eat don't eat red meat don't you know or don't eat meat at all that's even better um i listen to these it's like it's like i'm almost embarrassed to say now i mean i mean i listen to people like uh dr john mcdougall um you know who who was advocating this uh vegan diet and so on um so that that was that would probably be the main thing that i i wish i could change well here's another one i just i just thought as something else um i smoked cigarettes for 15 years yeah i've heard you say that that's crazy yeah right you know at the time i mean so every god i just like when i was say around 20 years old every everybody smoked and um you know it was kind of this thing about like well yeah they're telling me it's bad maybe i should cut back or you know this kind of thing and of course eventually i quit um but when i look back on that now wow lighting lighting tobacco on fire and inhaling it into your lungs like wow that's pretty crazy how long how long did you smoke for about 15 years oh man how many cigarettes a day well um so it wasn't all that many i mean probably even at my heaviest it was half a pack and then towards towards the end there it was more like five or six cigarettes a day that sort of thing but that was uh 35 years ago or so yeah so when when we i pro probably probably started uh you know about age 16 and probably smoked till i was 30 32 somewhere in there so what motivated you to quit just health yeah yeah i mean you know my just talking about my dad who had heart disease well he was a smoker he was also a doctor um you know back then even the doctors smoked and and so it was just totally normal you know in the environment um but then yeah eventually the messages started getting through to me and i thought yeah okay i better not do this so my mom smoked when she was pregnant with my brother and i so that's you know crazy just like literally crazy i can't imagine yeah yeah right right so advice would be don't go vegan uh don't go vegetarian and uh don't smoke back then that's what you would uh change right right don't smoke i mean the the message not to smoke cigarettes is of course you know everybody recognizes that now but it was at the time i guess it it was just so common i guess it was just less appreciated smoking was so common that that message wasn't appreciated have you tested lung functions since then uh i have um for some reason uh i was having some kind of problem medical problem this would have been over 15 years ago or something and i went in and so they gave me a chest x-ray and they said why don't you go get this lung function test so i did that and they told me i was in the top one percentile for my age ah nice all right so like okay i'll take it yeah all right so it wasn't that that much of a negative right where persistent yeah so that's good news all right i'm out of questions anything that we didn't cover that we could have covered should cover uh uh not that i can think of i think we covered a lot here cool all right thanks pd uh until next time well thanks a lot mike it was great talking to you thanks for having me same all right ciao okay all right ciao bye
