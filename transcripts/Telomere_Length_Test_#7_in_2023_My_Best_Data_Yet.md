By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tiir shortening is a hallmark of aging additionally tiir shortening negatively impacts other hallmarks of aging including genomic instability mitochondrial dysfunction and stem cell exhaustion more specifically t t length declines during aging with data for men and women as shown there on the y- axis we've got ltl or lucy t tm length in kilobases and on the x-axis we've got age plotted from about 20 to about 100 years old and for both men and women we can see that there's an age related decrease for tiir length such that tiir length in youth is about 7.75 kilobases whereas in centenarians or 100y olds it's closer to about 5 kilobases now essential premise of the channel is to slow aging by optimizing biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible including tiir length so with that in mind in today's video i have i now have 10 test since 20 22 so what's my data and then additionally which factors are significantly correlated with tiir length so let's jump into the data so to address that i sent blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own tm length there's a discount link in the video's description so the most recent test that i have data for just arrived uh about a week ago and that's test number seven in 2023 uh november 27th test and for that test we can see that tm length according to the screenshot was 7.1 kilobases but that's a an error because below that screenshot in the report it showed that it was 7.19 kilobases so for whatever reason there was a rounding error for whomever a true diagnostic made the this image now note that in youth 7.75 kilobases is what's found so i've got some work to do there to get it closer to youth from 7.19 to 7.75 kilobases but the good news is this is my longest tiir length yet over 10 tests so note that this is just one test though for comparison let's see how t length in 2023 compares against 2022 and that's what we'll see here on the y- ais we've got t length with data for 2022 on the left and 2023 on the right over 3 tests in 2022 average tm length was 7.04 kilobases and after seven tests in 2023 i increased it to 7.14 kilobases and note that on this image which includes all of my data we can see that now true diag notic properly rounded up as that 7.19 is a 7.2 there on the plot now rather than just looking at year-to-year averages we can calculate using a two sample t test if this is a significant difference and we can see based on the p p value being less than 0.05 i was able to significantly increase t length in 2023 versus 2022 and note that it declines during aging so this is a uh some this is a good good data so with that in mind which factors may imp t length how am i able or how have i done this or what's underlying potentially underlying this these improvements so let's start off with correlations for diet with t length and note that i looked at 87 different comparisons so 87 different correlations with tm length which included most of all of the foods that i commonly consume and then also macronutrients and micronutrients and note that for this approach it includes using the average dietary intake from one blood test to the next and when that means is that if there's a 60-day period in between blood tests if i take the average dietary intake for those 60 days that corresponds to the latter test and note that i track my diet with a food scale i weigh all my food i enter enter that data into chronometer and then put that data into a spreadsheet so i'm able to calculate averages for example for a given 60-day period so each blood test whether it's tm length or other biomarkers has a corresponding average dietary intake and then now that i have 10 blood tests i can look at correlations i technically i was looking at correlations after five blood tests but after 10 blood tests i can look at correlations between diet including foods macro macros and micros with tm length or with other biomarkers as i mentioned as i've shown in other videos so here's the first portion of that data and note that the the rest of these data are on patreon and the reason i did that is because there are 43 foods sl nutrients that were significantly correlated with with a p value less than 0.05 with kil length now going to patreon to see that data may not be important as we'll see in a minute uh but note that these these uh six foods and or nutrients have a p value that's less than 0.05 now in terms of the correlation as shown there little r which is the correlation coefficient we can see that parmesan cheese and cacao beans are inversely associated with or inversely correlated with t length so that suggests that relatively higher intakes of those two foods are significally correlated with a shorter tm length conversely positive correlations for selenium and the majority of my selenium comes from brazil nuts so you can see brazil nuts are actually significantly correlated with t length too that suggests that relatively higher intakes or at least towards the higher end of my range of intake is significantly correlated with a longer tiir length and then additionally vitamin b1 and ground black pepper also have positive correlations but note that these are unadjusted correlations and that's potentially important because calorie intake is also significantly correlated with t length so are these changes are these foods related to a longer or shorter t length or is it just calories that may be driving these these correlations in terms of the correlation for calorie intake with t length that's what's shown here and we can see that significant inverse correlation you can see the little r correlation coefficient is negative so a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a shorter tm length in my data and conversely a relatively lower calorie in intake is significantly correlated with a longer tmal length now with that in mind what happens if i'm able to consistently reduce my calor intake below its current about uh 2100 calories per day to somewhat lower somewhere around 2050 uh based on extrapolation of of this graph i may be be able to more consistently see closer to 7.2 kilobases for testing in 2024 so stay tuned for that data in in uh 2024 but i should mention uh there's going to be a lower limit to one can only get so lean before i start to impact muscle mass which that is the last thing i want to do it's get as lean as possible while not messing up all the any biomarkers right what's the lowest limit of leanness where i can optimize the majority of a biomarkers with without messing up other biomarkers and we'll see that that may be the case for some biomarkers like heart rate variability and resting heart rate in terms of body weight but that's a story for another day so in terms of now looking at adjusting these unadjusted correlations for calorie intake are any foods or nutrients significantly associated with tm length after adjusting for calorie intake so that's what i started to do here and now in this model we've got both parmesan cheese and calorie intake in other words again is parmesan cheese significantly correlated with tm length after adjusting for calorie intake and we can see that it is so even after adjusting for calorie intake a relatively higher parmesan cheese intake is significantly associated with a shorter ti length so with that in mind for the first test in 2024 coming up in a couple of weeks i've made another smaller cut to parmesan uh cheese i'm hesitant to completely take it out because it adds flavor uh to food so uh you know i'm not trying to there is a balance here between health and taste that i'm not trying to completely eliminate taste for the benefit of health or at least not yet all right so when looking then at the calorie adjusted p values we saw that the parmesan cheese is significant but then using this same approach selenium is now not significantly associated with t length and nor is vitamin b1 and if i continue down the list brazil nuts cacao beans and black pepper those two would not be significantly correlated with t length after adjusting for calorie intake so then the big question is will this approach work will reducing parmesan cheese and i should mention as a side note even though the calorie adjusted um associations for selenium brazil nuts cacao beans and black pepper are not significant i've actually kept my brazil nut intake towards the higher end of my range to further test this hypothesis and i've increased black pepper so i usually eat about 1 gram so i've doubled it to two whether that's going to make a dent i don't know we'll see so rather than just purely relying on the stats i can directly test these correlations by changing intake and then re-evaluating the correlations after each test so whether or not it'll work we'll see for the january test all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for tmr length and epigenetic testing ned quantification oral microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with c fox health which includes april b and other biomarkers that are mostly different from the metabolomics diet tracking green tea or if you'd like to support the channel we you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great
