# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #7 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The central premise of this channel is that aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the seventh time in 2022 so what's my biological age so here we can see that data and this is using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own biological age that link will be in the video's description so when entering data for its nine component biomarkers and chronological age we can see that my phenotypic age or biological age is 32.6 years which is 17.3 years younger than micronological now note that quests high sensitivity c reactor protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter again we've seen this in many recent videos so crp could be less than 0.3 but not more than 0.3 so the overall biological age could actually be a little bit less and besides looking at data in a spreadsheet all of the blood test data from the lab will be included via screenshots at the end of the video so if you're interested in that check it out now note that this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and i have 22 blood tests over that time span and that's what we can see here so first from 2018 to 2019 i had three blood tests with a an average phenowage or levine biological age of 36.1 years then over six tests in 2020 my average was 35.6 similarly in 2021 again 35.6 and then over the seven tests in 2022 my average pheno wage was 33.8 years now rather than just looking at averages from year to year we can compare these data using a two sample t-test and when comparing the 12 tests in 2020 to 2021 versus the 7 in 2022 we can see that i was able to significantly reduce the biological age score for 2022 when compared with the earlier two years so that's one way in looking at the data another is by looking at the difference for chronological hca minus biological hba and prior to this year my average biological age reduction relative to chronological age was 11.9 years and that's over 15 tests thus far in 2022 over the seven tests we can see that each of the tests was had a greater reduction than 11.9 years for the chronological age minus biological age such that my average reduction for ca minus ba was 15.5 years so i was able to further reduce biological age relative to the 15 tests before 2022. So i'll i'll update in a future video hopefully sooner rather than later i'm hoping to get it done sometime next week for which biomarkers improved year over year rather than just looking at the overall biological age score now pheno age isn't the only biological age tool that i use also i include aging.ai so what's my aging.ai age so aging.ai includes a 19 component biomarkers more specifically 19 biomarkers on aging.ai 3.0 and we can see my data here so if you're interested in double checking my numbers it's using the north american data set and these values and when i enter these values i get a predicted predicted age of 28 years which is 21.9 years younger than my chronological now just like we did for levine's test this is just one test so for more context let's have a look at previous data for aging.aih and that's what we can see here so i have a lot more data for aging.ai age i have 37 blood tests that go back to 2009 so 37 blood tests over the period from 2009 to 2022. So when i first started testing when i first started having data that i could use to compute aging.aih that was in 2009 and over three tests over a five-year span my average was 32 years now our three tests over five years representative of the uh aging.ai age or overall biological age so with that in mind in 2016 i started testing more often and we can see that from 2016 to 2021 i have 27 blood tests with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years so what about 2022 well we can see that with the green arrows and over the seven tests in 2022 my average aging.aih was 29.4 years now just like we did for pheno age i can compare these data from 2016 to 2021 versus 2022 using a two sample t-test and when i did that the data are not significantly different in other words over from 2016 to 2022 over that seven year span my average yearly aging.ai age is consistently in the 29 to 30 year range regardless of my chronological age all right so what may be contributing to these biological age reductions for these two tests including supplements fitness and or diet and i'll cover that in future videos again i'm hoping to get a lot of that done next week as i've got a week off from in-person work so stay tuned for that so if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch and i'll show the blood test data so for the discount links uh epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch which is what you can see here and if you're interested in that that link will be in the video's description too now on to the blood test data and i usually just let this data play but i want to highlight a couple of things that will be included and talked about in upcoming videos the first is homocysteine you can see that my value is 10 micromolar and for those who think i'm anti-supplements i'm not i just started glycine supplementation with the goal of bringing down homocysteine somewhere in the seven and a half range so i started that on december 15th of this year and for the rationale if you're interested in the why behind why glycine and not other stuff i intend on making a video update for that so stay tuned for that very soon it should be coming very soon not later what i also want to highlight is dhea sulfate and my value for this test was 109 micrograms per deciliter now just like homocysteine which relatively higher values are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and they increase during aging so my values going in the wrong direction similarly my dhea sulfate value is low and dhea sulfate has been shown to decline during aging and relatively lower levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk now for this test i try to reduce my fructose intake and why my fructose intake and how that links with dhea sulfate i'll do a video update on that so also stay tuned for that data thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
