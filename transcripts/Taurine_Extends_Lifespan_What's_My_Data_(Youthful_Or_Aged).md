# Taurine Extends Lifespan: What's My Data (Youthful Or Aged)?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A paper was published yesterday that identified taurine deficiency as a driver of aging so let's take a look at some of that data first serum levels of taurine decline during aging and mice on the y-axis we've got serum levels of taurine plotted against age in weeks and then we can see that significant age-related decline for cm levels of taurine we're considering that taurine declines during aging would supplementation then extend lifespan so that's we can see here with survival data for female mice and for male mice on the right and then in terms of survival we can evaluate median survival so that's the line at the 50 survival that's the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive and then notice the rightward shift for the taurine supplemented mice in other words taurine extends lifespan in both female and male mice alright so what about data in people does taurine decline during aging in people and that's what we can see here serum levels of taurine again on the y axis plotted against age and in this case the age is up to around 60 years old but the age-related decline is similar in humans and mice as you can see by the red lines which then raises the question to potentially increase lifespan should we be supplementing with taurine now to that question i think blood testing is a first step so with that in mind what's my data so i used at-home metabolomics with iowa below and if you're interested in using at home metabolomics yourself there'll be a discount link in the video's description so for my first test using at-home metabolomics this was in april of 2023 my circulating of taurine was 173.1 micromolar so to put that on the chart that will put me somewhere around there relatively useful so i don't think it makes sense to supplement for me for with taurine yet but i'm going to keep an eye on taurine going forward in future blood tests and if i start seeing age-related decline i'll change my diet and potentially supplement all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buy hack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics any de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel is different from myolos diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
