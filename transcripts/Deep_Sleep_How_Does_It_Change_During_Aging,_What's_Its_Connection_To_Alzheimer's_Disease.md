Deep sleep how does it change during aging what's its connection to alzheimer's disease and what's my data so first we're looking at a hypnograph which is a measure of sleep stage on the y-axis versus hours of sleep on the x-axis so starting from being awake when we fall asleep we progress through various stages of sleep light sleep being n1 and n2 defined as n1 and n2 and n3 being defined as deep sleep otherwise known as slow wave sleep so the subject in this picture spends about an hour in deep sleep and then they progress uh up to n2 uh relatively light sleep where they uh but then they go to rem sleep and spend a few minutes there so that right there is one sleep cycle and then the subject in this picture uh goes through another sleep cycle so first through n2 and then to n3 where they spend a little bit more time in slow wave sleep or deep sleep and this process continues throughout the night until we wake up at some point later in the future so uh just as a quick uh aside notice that most of the deep sleep uh is accumulates within the first four hours or so and then it goes away conversely rem sleep starts off relatively low and then accumulates throughout the night such that when we wake up it's mostly rem sleep dreams and dream sleep not so much slow wave sleep so how does slow wave sleep change during aging so before answering that first it's important to go through how total sleep time changes during aging so this is uh data from a meta-analysis of 65 studies and i'll post the link to all of these studies in the descript description for the video so uh for a young subject in this case 20 years old um young people sleep about 450 minutes per night so uh in contrast an 80 year old only gets about 350 minutes of sleep per night so what about slow wave sleep so in this case the percentage of sleep uh divide or slow wave sleep divided by total sleep time otherwise known as slow wave sleep percentage also declines during aging so for a 20 year old 20 year old gets about 20 percent of the total sleep time as slow wave sleep which when considering data in the previous slide 400 minutes 450 minutes of total sleep time that's about 90 minutes of deep sleep per night for the 20 year old however the for the older uh uh subject for the older adult and eight year old in this case they only get about nine percent of uh their total sleep time as slow wave sleep which considering that they uh an 80 year old gets about 350 minutes of uh sleep per night that translates to about 32 minutes of slow wave sleep so about three fold less slow wave sleep for an older adult when compared to a younger subject so how does getting less sleep during aging affect health well one way is linked with alzheimer's disease or amyloid beta production which is found in alzheimer's disease patients so uh first in looking at this plot here what what it basically shows is that a higher baseline proportion of slow wave activity during sleep is correlated with a reduced four year accumulation of brain amyloid beta a beta in 76 year old subjects so just looking at that plot so we've got rate of a beta accumulation on the y axis and then brain slow wave activity on the x-axis and what we can see by extrapolating with the trend line we can see that for subjects that had higher brain slow wave activity during sleep they had lower levels of a beta accumulation in their brains over a four year period so this was a longitudinal study so that's a good thing get more slow wave sleep have less a beta in the brain at least in this study conversely subjects that got a lower proportion of slow wave sleep had a higher rate of a beta accumulation in their brain over that four year period as as indicated by the arrow so why is a beta important so in looking at this uh simplified cartoon uh a beta affects uh the synapses the the points at which neurons communicate with each other so first in looking at the normal synapse uh and the condition when there is no a beta there's normal uh neuronal activity normal neuronal inter you know interneuronal communication however in in the situation where there is a lot of a beta in between the or at the synapse in between neurons it induces neuronal hyperactivation which leads to neurodegeneration so getting getting enough deep sleep to uh minimize a beta is important so one way um i plan on uh or trying when i plan on trying to reduce abd in my brain is by tracking my slow wave sleep so i do that by wearing a fitness tracker and i should point out that i'm not sponsored to promote them so i'm just gonna briefly mention who they are so i wear whoop and woop has been compared against uh the gold standard for measuring sleep in overnight sleep studies which is polysomno polysomnography psg so um so whoop was compared against psg for uh detecting each of the sleep stages so tst total sleep time wakefulness light sleep slow wave sleep sws and rem sleep so how did woop do when compared with the gold standard for measuring these sleep cycles or sleep stages so first in in terms of uh total sleep time whoop was just as good as the gold standard and similarly for slow wave sleep it was yeah as good as psg for detecting uh the amount of slow wave sleep so the values between the the two different methods whoop and psg was not uh statistically uh different so um based on this small this was a small study i think it was in like 12 subjects um one could argue that whoop is as good as the gold standard for uh you know psg for detecting uh total sleep time and slow wave sleep now well i should also mention too for wakefulness and light sleep it was also not different from psg however noticed that for the rent sleep whoop actually overestimated rem sleep by about uh 15 minutes so um however uh however discussion of rem sleep isn't in this video so uh but for what for what we want total sleep time and slowly sleep whoop is is based on this data just as good as the gold standard so how much nightly slow weight sleeve slow wave sleep do i get so this is data for uh the last 526 days so from may 2019 through october of 2020 so the amount of slow wave sleep in hours is plotted on the y-axis against time and um each day each dot refers uh corresponds to a day you know one day over the last uh you know year and a half so uh based on the trend line i get about 93 minutes of slow wave sleep per day so that would indicate that my slow wave sleep amount is relatively youthful which is a good thing so um that may change with time and if it does i'll try different things to try to uh get it going back towards youth so what variables affect slow wave sleep with the goal of optimizing it and if you can optimize it potentially we could uh reduce our accumulation of a beta with uh with time so two two things that i think may have an impact are i keep a consistent sleep schedule so i try to get to sleep between nine uh to 10 pm uh every night without fail and even there are some nights where i'm i'm trying to go to bed you know uh during from eight to nine o'clock earlier the better if it's dark outside time to get to sleep that's what that's how we evolve for millions of years uh and also try to stop eating or drinking at least three hours before bedtime in on many days now it's way earlier way earlier than that so maybe you know six to seven hours before uh bedtime so a long overnight fast um but are there other factors that affect slow wave sleep so the obvious would be just sleep more if you sleep more you'll get more deep sleep but is that true what does it dave say so at least for me for my data when comparing when looking at the correlation for slow wave sleep versus total sleep time so slow wave sleep on the y-axis total sleep time on the x-axis there is a significant a moderate significant correlation between those two so uh more sleep time uh more total sleep time more slow wave sleep that's a statistically significant correlation in my data and um to get the 90 minutes of slow wave sleep that's found in youth i would need to sleep about seven hours a night which is isn't isn't too tough for me to do so far uh at least at my age current age all right but which factors impact total sleep time you know it's easy to say just sleep more but how do you control your brain's uh how do you control your brain sleeping more while you're asleep you know it's one thing for me to say okay i'm gonna eat x y or z in my diet and that may impact you know muscle mass you know for example protein impacting protein synthesis but how can you use uh you know diet or supplements or anything to impact you while you're asleep that's a whole nother ballgame at least that you know my opinion so um so to investigate that i started looking at correlations between my diet with total sleep time with the hypothesis that maybe there are things in my diet that can affect how much sleep i get and if i get more sleep potentially i'm getting more slow wave sleep so the strong strongest correlation between total sleep time with all of my dietary variables was total calorie intake the average daily calorie intake and again this is during the same 526 day period from last year to uh this october and we can see a moderate uh correlation 0.35 for total sleep time with daily calorie intake and what it shows is the higher my calorie intake the longer i'll sleep um so with that hypothesis if if i just simply increase my daily calorie intake i should get more total sleep time and more slow wave sleep so uh in support of the hypothesis so that's just total sleep time versus daily calorie intake the goal is to get you know to maximize slow wave sleep uh what's the correlation between daily calorie intake with slow wave sleep so there there's a weak correlation but statistically significant so the correlation is 0.13 and it's significant at a p-value of 0.003 so what about the effect of an increased calorie intake on other metrics if i if i increase my calorie intake to increase total sleep time to increase slow wave sleep and we know that having more slow-way sleep may be good for reducing amyloid beta accumulation in the brain if i optimize that but it negative negatively getting too many calories negatively affects other variables well that's not good so what about other metrics so first increasing calorie intake may negatively affect resting heart rate rhr and heart rate variability these are two cardiovascular related metrics actually heart rate variability is a measure of sympathetic nervous system divided by a parasympathetic nervous system so it's not just the cardiovascular system so first in looking at heart rate uh versus calorie intake resting heart rate on the y-axis versus versus total calorie intake on the x-axis uh we can see that for a higher calorie intake there's also a higher resting heart rate and based on right now my average calorie intake is somewhere around 25 to 2 600 calories a day that would put me at a resting heart rate of about 48 beats per minute and if any if you if you've seen my previous video on what's optimal for resting heart rate values closer to 45 are associated with maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk so um eating about 2 600 calories at least based on this correlation with resting heart rate does puts me at 48 which is isn't too far from the 45 that's that may be optimal for health so if i increase my calorie intake resting heart rate would increase which is going in the wrong direction so similar data is observed for heart rate variability so uh based on my diet right now about 25 to 2 600 calories a day my heart rate variability uh is about 60 uh 60 milliseconds and uh as i noted in my last on my in my video for heart rate variability again link in the right corner values close to 70 are found in youth so if i increase my calorie intake based on the negative correlation here i'd expect my heart rate variability to be reduced which also is going in the wrong direction so uh just on to illustrate you know the the cat the link between calorie intake total sleep time slow wave sleep and these cardiovascular metrics it's important to identify the calorie intake that maximizes all of them not just selectively one but not others um so finding the sweet spot is key and that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
