# Reduced Blood Pressure: Was It Caused By Lung Muscle Training?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that inspiratory muscle training reduces blood pressure and that was true regardless if the study was performed in young middle-aged or older adults as shown by the green arrows so with that in mind the topic of today's video will be was my blood pressure reduced as a result of using a lung training device alright so let's start off with systolic blood pressure before lung training and this data is over a three-year period from september of 2019 through october of 2022 and that 60 individual days of data forces stock blood pressure and there we can see that my average was 123.1 millimeters of mercury or 103 23 for short now note that i measured blood pressure five to six different times around the same time of day so around noon and then it took the average of those five to six measurements and recorded them in an excel file all right so let's put these data into perspective how does systolic blood pressure change during aging and based on this plot it should be pretty clear that systolic blood pressure increases during aging both for men in green and women in blue now what's expected based on chronological age for someone of my current chronological age would be a systolic blood pressure of 125. So i guess it's all right that my systolic blood pressure average over the past three years has been 123 which is a little bit below what's expected but we can see that for someone that's around 18 years so uh youth we can see the systolic blood pressures at least for men is somewhere around 118 but is that optimal what's optimal for blood pressure well in one study that was published in 2021 optimal blood pressure keeps our brains younger or is associated with having a more youthful brain age so in this study they saw that people who had systolic blood pressures less than 115 had significantly lower brain ages as determined by mri scans of the brain so that's the goal to get it lower than 115 for systolic blood pressure what about diastolic blood pressure and that's we can see here over that same three year period before lung training my average diastolic blood pressure was 74.6 so let's put that data into perspective by having a look at how diastolic blood pressure changes during aging and in contrast with the systolic data we can see that there's an inverted u for diastolic blood pressure changes during aging so based on what's expected based on chronological age somewhere around 77 for diastolic blood pressure is what i would expect for my 50 years of chronological age now in terms of putting my data on this plot technically it could be found in someone that's 30 the average values for someone that's 35 to 40 years but also 65 to 70 years so the age related plot for diastolic blood pressure isn't really helpful for determining what's optimal so for that to figure out what's often before diastolic blood pressure let's have a look at that screenshot from the study that looked at optimal blood pressure and how it relates to brain age by mri and there they found that people who had diastolic blood pressures less than 75 or actually the combination of systolic and diastolic of less than 115 over 75 had significantly lower brain ages so that's the goal to keep it below 75 so technically although i'm just a bit under it i should be good in terms of slowing brain aging with having a relatively lower diastolic blood pressure but i think i can do better so now to the question of the day did lung training in effect systolic and diastolic blood pressure so starting with the data on the left which is my three year average 123. On the right we've got systolic blood pressure first with the lung training device and then without the lung training device so first using the lung trainer device which was the breather fit we can see that my systolic blood blood pressure was 120.3 and then when comparing these two groups of data with a two sample t-test this was a significant reduction in other words the when i use the breather fit the long training device there was a significant reduction for blood pressure when compared with the earlier data on the left now if the lung trend device caused this reduction in blood pressure if i remove the lung training device i'd expect to see an increase in blood pressure so is that true is that what i saw so to test that i for the next seven weeks i didn't use a lung training device post-breather fit and over that time my average systolic blood pressure was essentially the same 120.5 so systolic blood pressure did not increase after stopping the lung training device which then raises the question that if blood pressure was maintained without lung training it suggests that something other than the lung trainer impacted blood pressure so more on that in a second let's then take take a look at diastolic blood pressure so on the left we've got pretty long training again with 74.6 average over that three year span and then with the lung trainer and without the lung trainer on the right so when using the breather fit my average diastolic blood pressure went down to 72.1 and when comparing that with the data on the left with a two sample t-test this was also a significant reduction so once again there's a significantly reduced blood pressure in this case diastolic when using the lung training device again if this is a real effect if the breather fit caused a blood pressure reduction when i remove it i'd expect to see a blood pressure increase when i stopped using it so i tested that and post breather fit we can see that diastolic blood pressure did not go up in fact it was 71.2 but that without showing the p-value that's not significantly different from 72.1 so that diastolic blood pressure didn't go up when stopping the lung training device again suggests that something other than the lung trainer has impacted my blood pressure so which other factors could impact my blood pressure now one that may be playing a role is body weight as body weight is significantly correlated with blood pressure in my data so here we take we've got a look we're taking a look at systolic blood pressure plotted against body weight and this is from september of 2019 through february of 2023 and that's 120 uh sorry 102 days of data and there we can see a significant positive correlation for systolic blood pressure with body weight in other words a higher body weight is significantly correlated with a higher systolic blood pressure and vice versa so when my body weight has been lower my systolic blood pressure has been lower all right what about diastolic blood pressure so here we can see similar data as diet as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with a higher diastolic blood pressure and vice versa as my body weight has been lower that's been significantly correlated with a lower diastolic blood pressure so with that with this study in mind for the optimal blood pressure of less than 115 over 75 that suggests that if i can continue to move my body weight towards 148 and lower that i should be able to get my systolic blood pressure consistently less than at the and or an average systolic blood pressure consistently less than 115 over 75 which may slow brain aging at least that's the goal all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links for the discount links and papers will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
