# On Deck Longevity Biotech Presentation: Biological Age Optimization

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

The gauge which is a biological age calculator and i see morgan on the call so hi morgan and uh thanks for your thanks for uh you know developing this tool because i use it so often so yeah so i measured my blood test for the sixth time 2021 and then uh this morgan's biologically calculator includes uh nine uh blood tests biomarkers shown there albumin creatinine glucose etc and then when you plug in that data in conjunction with your chronological age uh it gives you your biological age or which is otherwise known as phenotypic age which in this case in this test was 36.9 which was 12 years younger than my chronological so the big question should be how good is this biological age calculator so uh these nine biomarkers and chronological age so that combination is strongly correlated with chronological age which is shown here in this plot of phenotypic age or biological age uh against chronological age so you can see it's almost perfectly linear and in two separate studies in nhanes iii and nhanes four these are you uh us-based cohorts of you know about ten thousand and eleven thousand subjects the correlation for this biological age tool with chronological age was zero point nine four and n hands three and zero point nine six in uh enhance four so a correlation of one is as uh perfectly linear that's as close as you can get you know uh that's as good as it gets for uh linearity so 0.94 is very close to almost perfectly linear so how how good does um morgan's test compare with the best epigenetic clocks because i think when most people think about biological age they don't think about these blood-based biomarker tools they think straightaway about epigenetic clocks so the best performing epigenetic clock in terms of its correlation with chronological age is the horvath clock and uh this is a multi-tissue uh clock that included 15 different cell types including you know just looking at the right side so breast cells cheek cells brain cells colon blood etc and when using that multi-tissue clock we can see that the co its correlation for uh epigenetic age with chronological age is 0.94 which is basically identical or very similar however you want to look at it to the levine clock using the blood-based biomarkers so the levine test isn't just strongly correlated with biological age it's also significantly associated with all cause more mortality risk or risk of death for all causes so for for every one year increase for biological age all-cause mortality risk increases by nine percent and this biological age again being using uh the phenotypic aid so uh morgan's test so this was true for all-cause mortality in a study of 11 000 plus people you can see that hazard ratio for every one-year increase in biological age that hazard ratio increases by nine percent now that was true whether uh it was young middle-aged or older adults so for every one-year increase in biological age using the beans test we can see that um uh all-cause mortality is increased by 13 10 and 8 in young middle-aged older adults and these are significant associations so it's not just all-cause mortality we can also break that down into disease-specific mortality and uh having an older biological age using levine's test was significantly cor associated with increased deaths from heart disease cancer lower respiratory disease interestingly not cerebrovascular disease uh diabetes related mortality and then uh deaths from influenza or pneumonia and then along those lines an older biological age from 2006 to 2010 so up to 14 years before the pandemic was associated with an increased all-cause mortality or associated with increased mortality risk in covert 19 patients and then last but not least an older biological age using levine's test is associated with an increased risk of death from kidney related issues including nephritis and nephrosis so while i just showed you data from my last test while that's a good start having data for many tests can provide for a more accurate picture and i see a lot of people testing once a year and then posting their data and whether or not that's reflective of the full year that that's another story so i'm going to go through all of my data that i've gathered over the past few years so i've measured um i had 15 blood tests since 2018 using levine's test and as we'll see in a bit i have more data than 15 tests for a different biological age tool so for more context let's have a look at the other five biological age results that i have in 2021 and that's what's shown here so levine's biological age on the y-axis versus time and starting from my uh 36.9 on my last test it wasn't much different from test number five but not as good as test number one 32.7 so when taking the average of these six tests in 2021 my average uh biological age was 35.6 so then the obvious question should then be how how does how do these biological age results compare with 2020 data because the goal that you know one of my goals is to slow biological aging or even you know stop it if if possible for as long as possible so what about 2020 data so uh my range for 2020 went from 33.5 of a low to as high as 39.8 but again over those six tests my average was 35.6 so just having two two different average values um you know we can assess whether they're statistically significantly different or not so to assess that i used a two-sample t-test and we can see that they are not significantly different so essentially i've got the same biological age using levine's test year-over-year now note that i i said i had 15 tests since 2018. These are 12 of them so i just started testing uh for crp because it's not included in the standard chem panel it's something you have to order extra at least here in the u.s so i only have three tests from 2018 to 2019 and over those three tests over a two year span my average levine biological age was 36.1 so at worst you know i've i flattened the biological age for at least a two year period but at best one could argue that i've reduced it over over a three to four year period now note that uh well i'm a big fan of morgan's work and everything that she does even if all nine biomarkers stay the same year over year biological age using this tool will increase 5.9 years for every one year increase in chronological age so to me if i'm 80 and i have the biochemistry the systemic biochemistry of a 20-year-old or at least it looks like that in the numbers am i you know up to 20 years younger than my chronological age or am i somewhere even younger than that so to account for that i i like to include other biological age tools including aging.ai which doesn't include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so aging.ai is also free to use and i should mention that i have an excel file as a downloadable link so if anyone out there is interested in calculating their own biological age just uh reach out and i'll send you that link and you can calculate your own uh you know biological age using morgan levine's test on your own so agent.ai 3.0 is also free to use hopefully it stays that way and you can find it at aging.ai so for that test it includes 19 biomarkers and that's usually the biomarkers that are found on a standard chemistry panel in a complete blood count cbc which in the u.s is about a 35 test and i should mention that uh crp is about a 45 test so essentially for 80 you can run two different biological age or blood-based biological age use two different tools so aging.ai has strongly correlated with biological age without including chronological age in its model and that's we can see there with its correlation of 0.8 for chronological aid but note that it's not as strong as levine's test uh so what about its association with all-cause mortality risk well biological ages that were younger than their corresponding chronological age were associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and this is true in a canadian cohort so for people that had biological ages that were greater than five years older than their chronological age we can see a significantly increased um all-cause mortality risk is shown there and then uh conversely people that had biological ages that were five years younger than their chronological age had significantly reduced all cost mortality risk as shown there and that data is basically uh the same in a u.s cohort in this case nhanes with similar values to the older biological ages with the increased all-cause mortality risk and the opposite data for people who had younger biological ages being associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk all right so what's my data so here's the my data for my blood test number six that's the test that i got done about a month ago and when entering all these values into aging.ai 3.0 i get a biological age of 29 years which is pretty close to 20 19.9 years than my chronological age so for more context just like we did with the levine's test data let's have a look at previous data for aging.aih because one blood test is interesting but more data can help tell the more complete story so i've been i've been blood testing as far back as 2009 and since then i've got 30 blood tests so from 2009 to 2013 i was just going to the doctor once a year for my annual checkup annual physical and then recording that data in an excel file and over the over three tests over that five year span my average aging.ai age was 32 years now note that i wasn't tracking diet i wasn't uh you know i was exercising of course and um trying to be fit in general that's always been a focus of mine but i wasn't as hardcore until starting in about 2015. And in 2015 i started diet tracking and i'll talk more about that approach uh in a slide or two but since i've been diet tracking for the last six and a half years i have a i also decided to start blood testing more often with the idea that more data again will help me get closer to what the actual picture is and then once i know what the actual picture is in terms of systemic biomarkers i can then go after trying to optimize it so over that six the last six plus year uh period uh my average biological age with two tests in 2016 was 28 29.3 over four tests in 2017 uh it's hard to see because it's in yellow so apologies for that 29.5 six tests in 2018 30.3 average three tests in 2019 over six tests in uh 2020 31.3 now it should be pretty obvious that these data are increasing in terms of biological age from 2016 to 2020. Unfortunately over six tests in 2021 i was able to at least slow that down uh to a with an average of 29.8 over those six tests which is definitely going in the right direction so uh over these 27 blood tests since i started diet tracking my average um biological age using aging daddy is 29.9 and my chronological age over that period is between 45 uh 43 and uh 45 uh 48 years old so i'm about 15 to 20 years younger using aging.ai consistently so then the big question is how am i doing it so i'm going to cover two aspects of that i'm going to go through my diet and some aspects of why i do and include some of the things that i do and then cardiovascular fitness metrics so in terms of diet what's the approach so as i mentioned i've been tracking my intake since 2015 and that starts with a food scale and i literally weigh everything i weigh all my food and then i enter those food amounts into chronometer and i'm not sponsored by chronometer there are other apps that can do similar things and then the chronometer is output data i take that including macro and micronutrients and the individual food amounts and i put that into a spreadsheet and then with enough data for diet fitness metrics and blood biomarkers and note that now i have up to 34 blood tests depending on the biomarker since 2015 i can investigate correlations between those variables and then followed by interventions aimed at optimizing the blood biomarkers which i expect will minimize disease risk and maximize longevity so what's my actual diet so here we're looking at my average daily dietary intake from november 1st 2021 through 12 12. And the reason those dates are important is because november 1st was the date of blood test number 5 and 1213 was the date for blood test number six so this 42 day period is the period in between blood tests so this is my average daily dietary intake for a 42 day period that then corresponds to blood test number six so for each blood test i have an average dietary intake and when with enough blood tests and enough average intake you can start to look at correlations so let's go through why i've got certain foods here and why they're important so atop the list are carotenoid-rich foods and that's because relatively higher blood levels of carotenoids are correlated with a younger biological age in this case it's an epigenetic test called grim age and so we can see that the higher the average level of carotenoids in blood as indicated by the bicore so the blue the blue column that's significantly correlated with a younger epigenetic age and then more specifically carotenoids are are subdivided into five main groups including lycopene alphacare alpha carotene beta carotene lutein plasaxanthin and beta-cryptoxanthin so each of those individual carotenoids are also significantly correlated with a younger epigenetic age as shown in the bicore plot and the p-value for statistical significance so i try to have my diet abundant in each of these five carotenoids for example watermelon watermelon and tomatoes and you can see that on the left uh you know they're how much i'm eating of them on a daily basis in terms of grams carrots are a rich source of alpha carotene carrots and spinach i get most of my beta carotene spinach and parsley i get most of my lutein and zeaxanthin and then red red bell peppers is a pretty good source of beta cryptoxanthin so also abundant in my diet are strawberries second and second on the list and one reason for that is because they're a rich source of trisetin which extends median and maximal lifespan in mice and that's what's shown here in this plot so we're looking at percent survival against age and we when we go to 50 survival this is the time when half the population mouse in this study it's a mouse study half the population is dead and half is still alive we can assess median survival and we can see that there's an increase in median lifespan in the physetin treated in the red line when compared with the control diet and there's also you can see there's an increase in the maximal lifespan here when compared with the controls too all right so also i've got uh foods like blackberry and parsley so why are they included uh these foods contain dietary cd38 inhibitors in parsley it's apigenin and in blackberries it's coromantid so why is that important so here we're looking at a plot of activity versus age and uh with nad and cd38 so nad which is a metabolite that that's involved in the health and functioning reverse virtually every organ system in the body nad levels decline during aging as shown there and then conversely cd38 levels increase during aging and that's important because cd38 is an nadas which means it degrades nad so one way to help slow this down is by including dietary cd38 inhibitors again epigenetic and chromatin which are found in parsley and blackberries and then by including them i expect to increase nad or at worst to potentially slow the age-related and nad decline now also abundant in my diet are mushrooms we can see about 167 grams per day and one reason for that is because they're a rich source of spermidine so why is sperm indian important and uh i should mention that i have videos on my youtube channel for basically all of these things you know physetin and carotenoids so if you're interested in any additional info i'm just going to give the abridged version in this uh presentation but if you're interested more info my youtube channel is a goldmine for everything else uh going into this stuff you know more in depth so spermidine extends lifespan this is data in mice again when looking at median survival we can see that spermatidine supplemented mice have an increased median lifespan when compared with controls now mushrooms are also a resource rich source of ergothioneine which up until a few weeks ago hadn't been assessed in terms of it in terms of its longevity uh potential longevity promoting effects in model organisms but a couple weeks ago a study was published in flies that shows that ergothioneine extends lifespan and flies and that's what's shown here so again looking at median survival we can see that two doses of ergothione significantly extended lifespan were compared with the controlled uh fed flies in the uh purple so just going so those data are in mice and flies what about in humans so here we're looking at all-cause mortality risk and this is for spermidine uh so all-cause mortality risk cumulative incidence of death on the y-axis against follow-up so up to 20 years after a baseline assessment of spermatid intake and what we can see is that the lowest uh all-cause mortality risk was for people that were consuming uh a greater than 11.6 milligrams of spermidine per day with higher mortality rates for people who are consuming lower sperm intakes per day so just from the mushrooms i get more than 11.6 milligrams per day i get about 11.8 just from mushrooms alone with smaller amounts in the rest of my diet all right now also note that for this for this dietary period i increased my intake of corn oats and barley and when you sum those three it was 154 grams per day which was only 30 about 32 grams per day for blood that corresponded to blood test number five so at 5x my intake of those whole grains or you know or starchy you know containing foods so why did i do that why did i increase whole grain intake for this blood test so in order to answer that now it's time to look at some of my blood test data so here's a data for glucose and this is 32 blood tests over the past six plus years and it's pretty clear to see that it's been increasing over time and more more uh specifically blood glucose has been greater than 90 milligrams per deciliter for 15 consecutive tests so what may be impacting glucose so to assess that i can look at again look i can look at correlations for my diet with the blood biomarkers and then alter you know stuff in my diet in the in an attempt to optimize blood biomarkers including glucose so uh this is correlations for macronutrients we'll start there with glucose so let's start with what's not significantly uh correlated with glucose and that's calorie intake is shown there with the r correlation coefficient and the p-value it's not statistically significant and then the strongest correlation for uh blood glucose is with fat a higher average uh daily fat intake so the higher my fat intake that's significantly correlated with the higher glucose and conversely the higher my carbohydrate intake that's significantly correlated with lower glucose and uh note that again this is for 32 dietary periods that correspond to these 32 blood tests now from whenever i've shown this data many people uh you know i don't know i want to say raise the outrage that they find it hard to believe that uh having a higher carbohydrate intake can be correlated with lower glucose but i think that pro that's probably true if you're eating a lot of junk and eating a western diet and it's filled with simple simple carbs and you know in my case as we'll see with full diet composition in a minute that that's not the case at all and along those lines we can see that a higher fiber intake is significantly correlated with a lower blood glucose so i get most of my fiber intake from carbohydrates i mean you know fruits and vegetables um uh specifically so uh that's probably what's behind the carbo carbohydrate correlation with with glucose now also note that a higher protein intake a higher average daily protein intake is also significantly correlated with higher glucose so my highest protein intake over the past six and a half years has been 147 grams per day uh but for this blood test it was about 108 grams per day so i've already cut it by 40 grams uh and going forward cutting it more doesn't make sense but what does make sense is going after the biggest fish uh biggest potential fish which would be fat intakes so let's take a little bit of a deeper look at that so we can see that my fat intake has been increasing uh since 2015 and if you look at the plot on the right versus the plot on the left they look almost identical although the plot on the left is for glucose and the plot on the right is for my average daily fat intake and again remember that each of these circles for fat is the average daily intake that corresponds to a blood test now my average daily fat intake i've purposefully been increasing it over time so that i can have enough data at low intermediate and relatively high values in order to have a data range to assess correlation with glucose and other other biomarkers now for the most recent blood test i cut my fat intake total fat from 116 grams per day which is one of my highest intakes to 94 grams per day and along those lines my blood glucose fell from somewhere closer to actually 100 to about 90 somewhere i think it was 91 or 92. Now if correlation is causation for the next blood test if i continue to cut in this case down into the 80 to 85 range that may bring my glucose out of the 90s and into the 80s for the first time in 16 tests now because note that because protein intake is also correlated with higher glucose i'm going to keep that close to the same uh 108 grams per day as the last test and when i do that that that will then that'll be better a better evaluator of what's going on in terms of fat intakes potential impact on glucose levels now i'm not just interested in optimizing one biomarker i want to optimize as many as possible so if i reduce total fat intake will it improve glucose and make other biomarkers worse and if so i may i may not want to reduce total fat intake all right so what are the big picture biomarkers uh so that's that's what's shown there and uh there uh basically they're basically 23 biomarkers and composites of biomarkers that cover multiple organ systems so more specifically they include glucose homocysteine as a as an index of methylation three markers of kidney function three markers liver function all the major lipoproteins all the major immune cells including platelets red blood cells and other red blood cell related measures like the average red cell volume and the red blood cell distribution with rdw inflammation so celiac protein and then overall biological age score with morgan levine's phenoage and aging.ai so when evaluating correlations for total fat intake with these big picture biomarkers 11 are significantly correlated so what what can we make of that if total fat intake is significant correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong then a higher fat intake daily fat intake may be optimal and for me i i can't suppose that this is true for other people without actually seeing what their data is so to assess what if they're going in the right or wrong direction how did these biomarkers change during aging and what's their association with all-cause mortality risk so i'm only going to cover a couple of these in the interest of time but again if you're interested in more info about uh further details about each of these biomarkers and how they change during aging and with all-cause mortality risk i've got that data on my youtube channel so let's start with the easiest one which is glucose here we're looking at uh average fasting glucose plotted on the y axis against against age and for both men and women in this case of highlighted the data for men as it directly applies to me we can see that glucose levels increase during aging also relatively higher glucose levels are significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so in my case a higher fat intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose so that's clearly going in the wrong direction so we give it a red arrow now another easy one to go through it are neutrophils which is shown here so we've got levels of neutrophils on the y axis plotted against chronological age with data from men in green and data for women in blue and for men it's pretty straightforward neutrophil levels increase during aging for women there's more variability uh likely related to pregnancy and along those lines i have that data in my neutrophil video on my youtube channel but nonetheless the data for women increases uh pretty consistently after 55 and then similarly a neutrophil levels relatively higher neutrophil levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so when starting with two to three thousand neutrophils per microliter there as the reference we can see that having relatively higher levels in that again is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so in my case a higher fed intake is associated with or significantly correlated with higher neutrophils and when considering the aging and all-cause mortality data that's going in the wrong direction so we give that a red error too so just using that same analysis a higher fat intake is significantly correlated with seven biomarkers going in the wrong direction so glucose blood urea nitrogen as shown there neutrophils the percentage of lymphocytes which is shown there monocytes and platelets now one biomarker that's actually going the right direction so a higher fat intake is correlated significantly correlated with a lower mcp so the average volume inside of a red blood cell and that's going in the right direction because lower mcv is found in youth and relatively higher mcv is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and these are in big studies uh so um so that's going in the right direction in terms of higher fat being better for that potentially being better for that biomarker now there are three debatable biomarkers including ast which is a specific for a liver for the liver but it's also found in other tissues and i say it's debatable because if you go by the all-cause mortality data uh relatively lower is associated with a lower all-cost mortality risk but when i do a biomarker versus other biomarkers so ast versus these other 23 biomarkers uh having a little bit higher asd is actually correlated with more biomarkers going the right direction than wrong so that may be a green it may be a uh sorry maybe uh is better so it would be uh green but then in my data it may be red so uh so yeah debatable and then similarly for ldl both lower and higher it had been reported in studies to be associated with an increase all cost mortality risk but when i do a biomarker versus biomarker analysis having relatively lower is uh seems to be better for my biomarkers correlated with more going in the right direction than wrong so this also may be a a red because a higher fat is correlated with higher glutes significantly correlated with higher ldl and then similar story for red blood cells so higher is found in youth and lower is uh you know they decline during aging and lowers associated with increased all-cause mortality risk so superficially that higher fat is correlated with higher red blood cells would seem to be positive but when using a biomarker versus biomarker analysis it's possible that there is such a thing as too high even within the range so um this potentially is also a red so even without the debatable biomarkers we've got definitively seven that are going the wrong direction of the 11. So from that i conclude that a higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with more of the big picture biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and then along those lines beyond the correlations with the glucose this explains why i reduced fat intake for my latest blood test and correspondingly increased my intake of higher carbohydrate-containing foods so what does the rest of the diet look like so this is going to be my full macro and micronutrient composition that corresponded to the last blood test in 2021 so a little bit less than 2 400 calories we already saw my protein intake full breakdown of fat intake full breakdown of carbohydrate intake and just i'm going to highlight some key notes note that i averaged 86 grams of fiber a day which is 3x the rda and that's intended to optimize the gut microbiome um and then i keep an eye on total fructose and total fructose intake so sucrose is fructose divided by two so when you sum that that's the total fructose intake that's because a relatively higher fructose fructose intake is significantly correlated with lower hdl of my data so this is actually a relatively low amount of fructose for me as i can eat you know tons of fruit i'm a fruitaholic i can eat that stuff all day so i've got to be careful with that based on my hdl correlation and then full vitamin breakdown and again you'll notice that most of this is way higher than the rda and one of the benefits of this approach is that i'm not just going after optimizing blood biomarkers but in doing that i'm getting closer towards a personalized diet that is you know optimal based on the blood biomarkers so it's like a two-way street of optimization both blood biomarkers and diet so some key notes here you can see the carotenoid abundance with each of those five individual carotenoids uh vitamin c intakes that are way higher than the rda and one reason for that is because there's a published dose response for higher blood levels of vitamin c with all cause reduced all-cause mortality risk uh similarly vitamin k and adequate intake is about 100 micrograms per day so for this blood test that was 17 times that and there's published data and again i have a video on that on my youtube channel where uh vitamin k intakes greater than a thousand micrograms per day may be optimal and then in terms of minerals there's a full breakdown this is a key highlight you can see my selenium intake which is also about three times higher than the rda and one reason for that is there published studies showing that up to 200 micrograms per day may be optimal and in terms of the rest of the diet so i showed the first 26 foods in terms of abundance so here's the remaining 26 foods in terms of how much of a diet their average intakes over the 42 day period that corresponded to blood test number six and i should mention i have a video on this uh you know on youtube but i for for some reason i didn't include that i had nutella uh so for every blood test uh i basically after the blood test is over for that day and the day after if i'm gonna splurge on some junk that's that's when i do it and then i basically shut it down for the rest of the blood test uh period you know so i didn't need any other junk for the 40 days after uh having it on the first two days um that corresponded to this blood test so four grams of nutella per day is is for a 42 day period that was about 160 grams over two days in conjunction with the peanut butter so i made homemade reese's peanut butter cups uh or not really homemade i just mixed those two together to make that all right so diet isn't the only fact that can affect blood biomarkers and biological aids so what about supplements and fitness and a big question i get is when i show these data people think i'm taking you know purported cena linux you know like nmn and r or other other you know metformin rapamycin so what what about supplements and uh cardiovascular fitness metrics so in terms of supplements i was diagnosed uh as being hypothyroid more than 20 years ago so this is prescribed i'm taking 137.5 micrograms per day of levothyroxine and then in terms of other supplements uh all i take is uh well vitamin d in the winter i didn't include that there but that should be there uh for this blood test it was uh methyl b12 a thousand micrograms per day and that was once every three days uh but that's it for supplements no other no no anime no rapamycin no metformin none of that it's all diet and exercise so what about fitness related stats so in terms of body weight i'm 155 pounds and again i weigh my myself every day two in the morning uh so about 70 kilograms and then my resting heart rate in terms of cardiovascular fitness resting heart rate is 47 about 47 beats per minute and heart rate variability is about 50 milliseconds so what are those what are those metrics and why are they important so the resting heart rate is pretty easy uh to define it's the number of heartbeats per minute while at rest and the fitness tracker that i wear records that automatically so it takes away the human error in measurement so is to when seeing these numbers let's put into perspective is cardiovascular fitness contributing to my relatively youthful biological age so first let's look at the aging data for resting heart rate and this is using whoop i wear whoop i'm not sponsored by them other fitness trackers do you know a similar thing by looking at resting heart rate heart rate variability i'm not here to promote them or any other any other brand so when looking at this data which goes from 20 to 50 years old we can see that the resting heart rate increases during aging for both women and red and men in blue so based on my chronological age i should expect to have a resting heart rate of about 56 beats per minute but in contrast i'm at the other end of that range 47.2 which one could posit would be youthful based on extrapolation so is a lower resting heart rate though associated with health so to assess that we can look at all-cause mortality risk against the resting heart rate and this is a meta-analysis of 46 studies that included more than 1.2 million subjects so we can see that when compared with the resting heart rate of 45 which was lowest all-cause mortality risk as the resting heart rate goes away from that all-cause mortality significantly increases so that would seem that would suggest that my data of 47.2 may be youthful and associated with health but there's a but in this story so whereas the woop data only went up to 50. This is data for fitbit users and we can see that in agreement with the woop data resting heart rate does indeed increase up until about 50 for both women in green and men in blue but after 50 from 50 to 85 now we can see that resting heart rate decreases during aging so how can we know if a relatively low resting heart rate in my case is indicative of health or low because of aging so looking at data for heart rate variability can provide more insight about cardiovascular fitness so what is hr hrv so the simple definition is that it's the variation in time in between successive heartbeats so for example if your heart rate is 60 beats per minute the assumption is that it beats exactly once every second but that's not true it can be 0.9 1 1.1 you know and that would give you the same 1b per minute average but there is variability in the time in between beats and that's what's shown here so based on these times in between beats we would get a heart rate variability of 67 milliseconds and this is using the rm ssd method in case anybody wants the details on that all right so how does the hrv change during aging so that's what's shown here and again this is group data now goes up to 65 for some reason but what we can see is that when looking at the high end of this range so starting in youth where 20 year olds have values of about 110 that get knocked in half about half to 65 year olds similarly that happens to median values and that also happens to the low end of this range so it should be pretty clear that hrv declines during aging so what about my data so for the last test my average hrv every day my average daily was 50.3 which would put me for my chronological age somewhere there now note that the median hrv for my chronological aid is somewhere around 42. So in to answer the question you know is my low resting heart rate uh good or bad is that the aging or is that youthful uh in my case resting heart rate is relatively low in conjunction with a heart rate variability that is higher than the median for my age at worst or at the low end of the range for a 25 year old so there are two situations low heart low resting heart rate high hrv which are found in youth and then a low resting heart rate and a low heart rate variability which are found in older adults so to address that question i posit that my data is more representative of youth because if my average heart rate variability was below the median for my age then i that that would suggest that my low resting heart rate would be in conjunction with a low heart rate variability would be indicative of poor cardiovascular fitness but that doesn't seem to be the case based on these data now similar to uh the blood test stuff this is only you know the data that corresponds to one test how's my data since 2018 and i say since 2018 because i started tracking this stuff uh in august of 2018. So i have more than 1200 days of data for both resting heart rate and heart rate variability so first the resting heart rate data so and each each dot corresponds to one day so uh just to delineate that so in 2018 uh my average resting heart rate was about 51 beats per minute and notice note that i wasn't inactive at any time uh during during this journey i mean i've always you know strength trained two to three times a week walk 10 to 15 miles a week so i didn't go from sedentary to fit so i've always been relatively fit so uh in 2019 i reduced the resting heart rate down to about 49 to about 48 in 2020 and then to closer to 47 in 2021 and we can assess these chain these uh differences when compared to 2018 using a two-sample t-test so we can see that uh based on the t-test the p-value each year since 2018 i've significantly reduced it uh you know yeah relative to 2018 value so it's a statistically significant uh reduction for resting heart rate for each year when compared with 2018. So is it going in the right or wrong direction is a cumulative thing not just one one you know for one blood test as i showed before so again we go back to how it changed how resting heart rate changes during aging so first up to 50 we can see that resting heart rate increases during age so at least i've resisted the age-related increase for resting heart rate but then the same question arises how do we know that i'm not on the declining age-related decline for us to heart rate so to assess that let's take a look at heart rate variability since 2018. So i started off in 2018 uh with about four months of data with a heart rate variability of 47. I increased it in 2019 to 56 further increased in 2020 to about 58 and then i had a little bit of a dip in 2021 to 52. And each of these uh years each of these data for each year is significantly higher than 2018 so i've been able to uh significantly increase heart rate variability each year since 2018. So to answer that question how can we know if the declining resting heart rate is indicative of better or worse cardiovascular function uh let's go back to the data for how heart rate variability variability changes during aging and then when looking at the data for my chronological age this three year period from 45 to 48 or up to about 49 that 12 1200 plus day average is about 54 milliseconds which is higher than the median for my age so if the resting heart rate uh a reduction that i've had over this three plus year period was in conjunction again with a relatively low heart rate variability that would suggest worse cardiovascular function but that does not seem to be the case for me so that suggests i've been able to improve my cardiovascular fitness at least since 2018 but note that it's not all sunshine in 2019 and 2020 i had higher heart rate variabilities so um that shows that there's room for improvement especially since i had a little bit of a dip in 2021 even though 2021 was better than 2018. So then the big question going question going forward is you know is the 2021 data the sign of a decreasing cardiovascular fitness and 2022 is going to have a lower heart rate variability or will i reverse this trend and get it back to 2019 2020 to get at my highest levels all right so that's all i've got for now um there are lots of places to find me online including on patreon uh and with that uh i'm ready for questions oh hey wow that was awesome what a what an incredible sort of like outlay of data and just like so meticulous too i just i just love it um so yeah thank you thank you once again um mike for for coming in and speaking uh maybe we'll get to a couple questions but um yeah but before i do that actually i want to make sure that we ask you know the question that we ask all our our speakers um you know in the spirit of service here at one deck is there anything that we can do to help you i know you mentioned some things on on the last slide but uh i just opened that up for you as well yeah i mean patreon is a good spot uh it's a growing community there so that's probably the top but uh if you want to know more about any of the things that i presented i've got further detailed analysis with approaching 100 videos on my youtube channel so that's another place to get some pretty pretty solid content um those are probably the two top self-promotion uh yeah places to go okay awesome great so everyone check out uh mike's stuff on youtube and also his patreon okay great so we have a couple questions um uh carl uh asks do you do time restricted eating that's a good question yeah i do and uh the thing is so i i try to stop eating all of my food so i wake up between four and six a.m so i basically start eating as soon as i wake up and uh i stop eating by 3 p.m on most days on the weekends it's about probably about 2 p.m some days it's about 1 p.m i don't notice a difference in the blood biomarkers when i time restricted you know when i do trf i don't i don't notice a difference there but i do it mostly for an improvement in sleep quality because i'm eating such a high fruit and vegetable diet which is a lot of water you know fruits and vegetables are water abundant so i used to have a really bad problem of eating two to three hours before bedtime and again normal food fruits and vegetable fruits vegetables all the things that i just showed that i ate and i'd wake up to pee two three four times during the night time and i'd wake up in the morning just feeling terrible so by doing this because this gives me you know six to seven hours before before i go to bed with enough time to you know use the bathroom before which limits my nighttime awakenings which leads to better sleep quality so um for that reason trf is is the major reason why i include that but also that i may get the benefit of you know uh you know fasting may drive the um longevity promoting effects of the calories through the diet and i'm mildly cr um depending on what you define as my ad lib intake so um you know maybe there's secondary effects there in terms of longevity we'll find out right we'll find out over the next 70 70 plus years if the trf also impacts that so okay awesome your uh your gi tract is uh is very impressive for uh 85 grams of fiber per day in a you know only half the day half the 24 hour period so i don't know if everyone could do that and probably you couldn't do the one meal a day thing some people really like to do and maintain that quantity of fiber is my guess i've done i mean i've done it as one meal a day i used to eat i used to fast all day and then you know do omad from 6 to 9 pm at night so it's it's doable i mean granted in the beginning it was you know uh i trade up i had to work my way up to it but um and there are certain foods that aggravate my gi tract that i have to stay away from or minimize so i think if you find you know foods that you can tolerate that don't cause more gi distress than then can potentially impact the blood biomarkers i think it's easily doable but that said i wouldn't recommend doing that replicating my diet as an approach for everybody you know i do this because having a higher fiber intake even as high as that is significantly correlated with more of these big picture biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong and i actually titrate i'm consistently titrating how much omega-3 how much omega-6 how much saturated how much saturated fat from dairy how much saturated fat from things like coconut butter uh to to optimize the blood biomarkers but also by evaluating them both i can see how the diet is correlated with the blood biomarkers so if more things are going in the wrong direction than right i get towards a more precise amount so for someone for for some people eating a very high fiber diet may be correlated with more biomarkers going the wrong direction than right i'd say don't do it then it's not for you you follow your own data so okay awesome awesome um aaron do you have a question uh you can come off me or i can read it for you sure hey michael uh so is there an online database for all the biomarkers um with age correlation somewhere i like not so for for aging.ai what you do there is you put in your a whole list of information and then they just throw it through a black box and then they spit out some number to you but is there raw data like is there just like a database somewhere of raw data for changes over time of all any and all measured biomarkers you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah so um yeah so the the direct answer is no um okay i hate to say i'm the first to start to look at this stuff but i'm probably one of the first to uh start to try to organize that and uh on my youtube channel i mean if you just do a search for the biomarker of interest i've uh i basically go after the largest so i i do comprehensive literature reviews and then basically put in the videos the most representative data um but you know i'm going after very large studies you know if they exist for other things like mcv maybe there aren't studies of 10 000 people where we've got mcb published data but for each of these major biomarkers yeah i've got that on my youtube channel in terms of in terms of age-related changes and changes with all cause uh mortality risk um okay we're gonna need that at some point so i'll try to i'll see if that can be pushed into the current project morgan mentioned and haynes what's n haynes it's the national health and nutrition examination survey okay no problem it's been a while yeah cool okay awesome um brad do you want to come off me and ask your question uh yeah sure it's all the same um yeah thank you dr leskerman that was really incredible um to do all that guinea pig work for all of humanity um do you have the raw methylation data on yourself from those biological age tests that you've taken up to this point yeah so uh i i do i have i have data for two tests but i'm not ready to present it yet because i wanna have more data and and when i start presenting the epigenetic data i wanna have it with correlations with not just the blood biomarkers but diet but yeah fortunately i reached out to the horvath group and the clock foundation i don't know if they're on the call now and uh yeah they agreed to measure at least two samples um using all of their epigenetic tools and uh we may actually uh be working together to uh provide epigenetic analysis every time i do the other blood tests so uh i'm pretty sure there isn't published data for you know levine's phenotypic age and aging.ai and how that even compared well there is some data but at least at the end of one level i don't think there's any published data so it'll be interesting to see how the epigenetic data with more tests looks in correlation with these other blood-based biomarker metrics yeah wow fascinating thank you it's really interesting um and this is a bit more in the weeds maybe than most so i apologize to some ears but um just to throw a potential wrench in the works down the line i don't know if people are thinking about this this much but uh the clocks that are trained on chronological age i know sometimes have diminished returns with regards to their all-cause mortality so that might be something if you're if anyone's using that as a golden standard to sort of keep in mind going forward but that's that's just a ongoing problem in the field i think yeah and morgan morgan just noted that too yeah i mean they are noisy uh so that's another you know and i'm a big fan of the epigenetic clock approach uh but at some point the noise you know the variability will be reduced uh and i'm definitely going to integrate that you know as potentially in a higher level to uh you know optimize everything but in contrast most people i'd say you know are not thinking about these blood-based biomarker tools um which is disappointing uh you know because they you know these biomarkers have been studied for 50 to 100 years plus depending on the biomarkers so it's well known how they change during aging um and with all-cause mortality risk whereas for the epigenetic clocks even that it's still being uh discovered all epigenetic epic genetic clocks aren't the same for their predictive ability with chronological age or all-cause mortality or even which aspects of aging that they're even measuring so um but like i said i'm a big fan of that approach and uh even multi-ohmic uh base clocks um so i've got my eye on that stuff too i'm not just trying to stay in one box the blood-based biomarkers forever i'm always trying to look how to branch out and improve okay that was very informative there's a wonderful presentation thank you thanks brad actually i had a question to to segway on to that do you do any other sort of like functional measures that you you track over time as well or and also you mentioned something about sleep too yeah i track i mean uh strength you know i have a pretty standard uh fitness workout you know compound movements so i'm i i'm always paying attention to physical function there uh but cognitive function someone was asking me about that you know and i mean that's hard to gauge i mean basically someone you could you could tell by i don't know how someone talks you can you can hear it over time i don't know maybe people listen to my youtube videos you know a couple years ago versus now and hear a change i don't know but yeah i do track sleep uh there is some uh decent comparison with the gold standard for sleep polysomnography with my fitness tracker with uh slow wave sleep and total sleep um how good that actually is i'd say debatable it's still an evolving field and very small studies too so uh but i do track that stuff i don't try to optimize it so much anymore these days based on changing my diet to optimize sleep i find that again the trf does the best to improve sleep quality and even extending potentially my uh slow weight sleep which declines during aging but yeah i'm tracking all the stuff that i mentioned physical physical strength uh flexibility mobility balance all those things because i don't want to be 80 and i you know can't bend down and tie my shoes or you know uh or move because mobility the clients during aging too uh but yeah sleep and physical fitness too those are big aspects and in terms of like you know just in the name of science doing all this tracking and biological you know optim age optimization have you ever been tempted to you know try some of the the more esoteric interventions i guess like uh i don't know like metformin or around the myosin and see what happens to the the biomarkers yeah so i'm not i'm not opposed to these purported semalytics and not opposed to it at all i just i think i targeted need so for example here here in the summer i i try to get as much sunlight full body exposure as possible so that i can actually have my skin make vitamin d but in the winter it's impossible so i have to supplement with it right so same thing with b12 methyl b12 reduces my homocysteine by about 20 percent if i could do that totally through diet i would but you know i have i don't know 17 or 18 blood has something like that for homocysteine that it seems to be resistant to all of my dietary changes so far i've tried other things in the published literature to reduce various things whether it's liver enzymes or changing my diet but i just i i you know maybe there'll come a point when diet and exercise and tweaking and doing my own little interventions doesn't work anymore and i have to take something like metformin but i think most people jump to that right away without going after the foundation of what's causing high glucose in the case of metformin um as an example but even things like rapamyces so rapamycin's a well-known antifungal especially against things like candida candida infections and bloodstream infections with candida uh increased during aging so older adults have about a 10 to 15 increased incidence of bloodstream infections with candida versus younger age groups so if i have a documented bloodstream infection for sure i'm going to take rapamycin or whatever the antifungal of choice would be to kill that you know specific antifungal species so and i'm actually considering doing a blood microbiome analysis there are companies that do that maybe i have a subclinical you know subclinical amounts of fungi in my blood that shouldn't be there right so uh yeah i'm i'm open to taking these things but you know but even then how much to take and uh you know in terms of milligrams per day or micrograms per day and you know how often by using this approach it doesn't have to be okay this is what the animal studies show this is what the rct show in my opinion all published data has to be evaluated at the end of one level even if the study had a million people 10 million people 50 million people and it works on a population based average you still have to do the individual testing with an ample testing not one or two tests maybe 10 15 20 an abundance of tests to see if it actually works for you and then with that said too is it net beneficial is it neutral is it detrimental right really taking a scientific approach to whichever supplement whether it's rapamycin or something else right so i wish more people were doing that rather than just based on hope and you know public studies you know looking at their own data to see if it's actually beneficial um so that's how i would do it okay yes absolutely and i think i think that's something that we can all take to heart like you know in terms of actually measuring in a meticulous way you know in the scientific way and i i really enjoy that um obviously it's a little hard to do uh here in canada but i think in the us it's a lot easier to get these blood tests um and it's also tedious right and time consuming to do the correlations on my own it's time consuming i should say i'm working with one company right now i'm i have plans in mind to develop my own company to make it easier to do this for other people so uh eventually this will be much easier to do whether it's through me or other people doing it okay awesome looking forward to that okay so i'd just like to thank michael uh for for giving an amazing talk again you know spending his time to answer all our questions fantastic learned a bunch and uh yeah um hopefully we can have you back sometime in the future thank you so much all right thanks nathan thank you all right take care everyone bye you
