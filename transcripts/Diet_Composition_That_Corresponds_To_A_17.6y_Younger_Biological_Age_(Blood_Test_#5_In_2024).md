# Diet Composition That Corresponds To A 17.6y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #5 In 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number five in 2024 when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age we saw that my biological age was 17.6 years younger than the chronological so what might be contributing to these data in the last video we covered supplements and if you missed that i'll put the video link in the right corner but what about diet more specifically what diet composition corresponds to blood test number five so for here for now we're going to take a look at average daily dietary intake this is from may 28th that's immediately after blood test number four through july 25th that's the day before blood test number five and that period is 59 days so immediately after the last test through the day before the next test that 59-day period i take the average uh daily intake average dietary intake as i weigh all of my food so the full list is shown here so i ate 54 different foods for this period and this list is ranked in grams from highest to lowest with the exception of coffee i had one 20 ounce coffee this isn't anything from starbucks or anything crazy like that just uh black i made it home um brewed myself so that's an ounces and also green tea is an ounces and if you want to use what i use there's a discount link for organic loose leaf green tea in the video's description all right so what about experiments for this test so the goal is to always improve to optimize all of the biomarkers simultaneously not just focus on a few so to do that i run several experiments and then calculate correlations after each test so what experiments did i do so the most important one potentially was reducing mushroom intake from an average of 250 gram per day for for test number four to 95 grams per day for test number five so why did i do that experiment mushrooms are a rich source of ergine spermine which extends lifespan in mice so why would i cut mushroom intake well mushrooms can conin niin but as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid and i raised that question because if it's nicotinic acid i'd expect my nad levels to be higher than they usually are as they generally track on the low side or age expected which is a dirty word in my approach age expect being a dir word so that they're not relatively high with high doe mushrooms which are rich in nyson that suggests that mushrooms contain a lot of nicotinamide and that's potentially important because as we'll see in the next video nicotinamide increases plasma levels of homosysteine a lot more than nicotinic acid so i did the experiment that maybe having mushrooms a mushroom intake a bit too high may be contributing to my age expected values or current values for homeline so did that work stay tuned for the next video for that data and the story i also added broccoli sprouts into the approach so i grew them myself at home and then reintroduce broccoli into the approach as for test number four i cut it out for most of that period and i did that because both broccoli sprouts and broccoli are rich sources of sulfurane which can reduce oxidative stress oxidative stress can limit teir length and knowing that my teir length has also been trending on the lower side for the past few tests i want to reverse that trend and try to get it closer to as close to youthful values as possible teir tests aren't yet in those results are expected in the next week or so so stay tuned for a video update for whether any of these changes impacted uh tiir length in an upcoming video now also note that to maximize sulfurane content which is lost in cooking so i added the broccoli sprouts to a cooked mix after it was done cooking but still that the temperature of that mix is 212 f or 100 uh celsus so it's possible that there was some degradation of sulfurane induced by heat so to help minimize that i added mustard powder in terms of how much mustard powder to add to cook broccoli or when eating broccoli sprouts i'll post that in a relatively short video uh coming up in the near future i also reduced coconut butter and cacao beans as these are my two primary sources of saturated fat in the diet and i did that following the correlations with an older epigenetic age using the horvath test which is the best epigenetic cl clock for asking how old are you what's your birthday so in my data uh total fat and a relatively higher saturated fatty acid intake are significantly correlated with an older horvath epigenetic age so to test that correlation if i cut saturated fat and if i cut total fat i should see an improvement if correlation equals causation i don't know if that's true i have to do the experiment so for this test i cut the two primary sources of saturated fat in my diet coconut butter and caca beans i also added kimchi into the approach as it's fermented cabbage and i did that because fermented foods including kimchi contain certain lacto basilla species which have been shown in both animal models and human randomized control trials to have a positive impact on the gut muscle axis in other words improving muscle mass and function with specific lactobacillus species isolated from fermented cabbage if you miss that video it'll be in the right corner now in terms of dose and people completely unknown i have no idea how high to go but i figure at least having some may be better than none so kimchi will be in and out of the approach at relatively uh low amounts for future videos future diet composition videos i also increased brazil nuts to close to their highest intake since i started tracking diet in 2015 and i did that exclusively for their selenium content as i was trying to make a positive impact on the free t3 to free t4 uh ratio these are thyroid hormones so that ratio declines during aging selenium is a required co-actor for converting t4 into t3 so i tested the hypothesis that if i increaseed selenium intake i could increase that conversion of t4 into t3 and improve the free t3 to free t4 ratio unfortunately it didn't make a dent increasing uh uh selenium intake from about 260 up to 400 micrograms per day didn't make a dent on either free t3 or free t4 as they were exactly the same at both the lower and higher selenium intakes so for the next test i've reduced brazil nut intake back to where it was prior to these changes so around 7 8 g per day relative to 14 g per day i also increased s sardines and this is about a 45 g per day increase relative to the last test and i did that because sardines have a plus 6 net correlative score with a panel of 25 clinical chemistry biomarkers that i track for every test and that i calculate correlations on and that doesn't include correlations with epigenetics or metabolomics so that net that strong net positive correlative score suggests that if i eat towards the higher end of my intake range for sardines that should have a positive effect on more biomarkers in terms of aging and all cause mortality risk now increasing sardines for this test didn't make a dent on pheno agage as it was almost exactly the same test over test number four versus number five and almost all of the other biomarkers didn't change with the exception of blood uria nitrogen going up up by a bit and uric acid going up by a bit and that's not a surprise as higher protein intake probably more of that converted into bun and sardines are a meat source so they they probably have a high purine cont content which can be converted into uric acid nonetheless it didn't make a big dent on at least the clinical chemistry biomarkers so for now i've cut them back down to where they were for test number four and that story will be more in the uh next video when we talk about mushrooms and homosysteine and nicotinamide all right so what about other uh aspects of the diet including cheat meals so the diet isn't always purposefully clean and i do that because if i try to go completely cold turkey no junk ever i get to a point where i start thinking about junk food and that can increase the risk for a binge and i'm trying to avoid any excess uh eating over the calorie goals that i set every day trying to be mild cr for as long as i physically can so with that in mind i include a couple of cheap meals for at least 2 days out of every dietary period so for this test it was no baked cheesecake the kind of stuff you know you can buy it at the store in a in in a container already pre-made and mixed in two separate containers on day one raspberry jam on the first first day or actually raspberry jam and caramel sauce two separate containers and then i decided which one i like better and had the raspberry jam mixed with cheesecake on the second day so that's only two days of junk and then after that i shut it off 57 days afterwards completely clean no junk at all in terms of the calories that were provided from the junk from these three foods about 1,600 from cheesecake about 600 from raspberry jam and about 315 from the caramel sauce together they add up to a little bit more than 2500 calories and when divided by total calorie intake for this 59-day period it's 2% of total calories so the diet was 98% clean now for other tests it's been 99% clean so what these data suggest is that whether it's 99 or 98% clean that doesn't seem to have a big impact on at least pheno agage and the clinical chemistry biomarkers i'm analyzing the metabolomic data now and the epigenetics aren't yet in there may be some changes there but we'll have to see how that plays out uh so the big question is how clean does a diet have to be to have one's most youthful data right i'm not against fun foods right and and enjoying my diet which i generally do but is it 95% and i'm not trying to do that experiment i think 1 to 2% for me is the lowest limit i'm not trying to mess around with how clean or not um others can do that experiment but for me this is what works all right so this list is ranked in grams which foods are are the top contributors in terms of calories and that's what we'll see here with the top 10 foods and this list is generated by chronometer if you want to track your own diet using chronometer there's a discount link in the video's description so the top contributor for calories as it has been for many tests is sardin so apologies to the vegans but uh this is just what works for me in terms of the other foods on the list nine of the foods nine of the 10 foods that are on this list were also in the top 10 list for test number four at this point the goal is not to blow up the system it's to opt is to keep biomarkers that are are already mostly youthful as evidenced by pheno age and a few others blood pressure uh lung function etc strength body composition i'm not trying to blow up the system i'm i'm trying to make small changes to improve weak spots like homocysteine horvath horvath epigenetic age increased dhea sulf sulfate by bit increased ti length back to youthful levels but without blowing up the rest of the system so you can see for nine of the 10 foods that were on this test in the top 10 for calories they were also in the top 10 for test number four all right so what about macronutrients so first starting off with calorie intake the average daily calorie intake the 59-day period that corresponds to this test was 2,162 calories now this is the second test in a row since 2021 where calorie intake was non sequentially lower so for 21 consecutive tests over the past 3 years i cut calories by a small amount for every test very small amount not 500 calories per day not 200 calories per day for me losing uh cutting calories too fast and losing weight sl fat too quickly has led to a rebound gain and i was trying to avoid that as much as possible so that's why i made very small calorie cuts over a very long period of time now two tests ago i stopped that and i increased the average calorie intake for test number four by about 40 calories per day and i did that because i started to see a strength decrement for things like pull-ups and the overhead press uh overhead shoulder press now the goal is to be as lean as at least my goal goal is to be as lean as possible without any deficit in strength i don't care if i'm 160 lb or 140 141 lb i don't want to lose an ounce of strength regardless of which body weight that i'm at so i started to see a strength decrement so i added calories by a little bit for the last test for this test i increased to a little bit more so now i'm about 100 calories higher than i was two tests ago at 2162 and i have no plans to change the calorie intake going forward i'm going to stay at this calorie level as strength has somewhat come back um so i don't know if that's for because of calories or because of i've increased nad by a little bit both of those may be involved but those are stories for another day in terms of average daily protein intake for this test 112 grams per day which is 21% of total calories in terms of fat intake 83 gr per day which is about 35% of total calories and then for comparison let's bring up test number four so you can see that the major cut was first total fat from about 9 3 to 83 gam per day so 10 c 10 g per day cut with the goal of improving the horvath epigenetic age in terms of where that fat fat cut came from you can see that it was from saturated fat at about 8 gram per day now also note that i didn't change omega3 and omega 6 as they were 9.6 and 16 g for this test and in the same ballpark for test number four so again trying to keep other aspects of the diet stable while make making specific cuts or reductions or increases to other areas but very specific cuts while not blowing up the rest of the system there was a small decrease for mono saturate fat but as you can see the biggest cut was to saturate fat intake again for horvath trying to test that correlation all right next up carbon take so total carbs were 281 gam per day which i say a lot that may seem like a lot but net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake for this test was 88 gam per day so when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 193 g per day we'll multiply by 4 calories per gam and then dividing that by calorie intake multiplied by 100 net carbs that correspond to this test was 36% now note that al fiber also contributes calories to the diet and that's because uh fiber is comprised of insoluble and soluble fiber the soluble fiber is con converted by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids in other words a fraction of fiber about 20% is converted into fats so about that 20% equates to about 188 calories or 9% of the diet coming from fiber being converted into fat so i can add that to total fat with and then we can calculate net macros which for this test were 43% total fat 36% net carbs and 21% protein now within total carbs i also pay attention to sugar intake but more specifically spefically sugars are there's a big wide net for sugars but more specifically i track total fructose intake because the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables especially fruits and vegetables that are rich in fructose and in my data total fructose is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i have to make sure that it's towards the lower end of my range to try to minimize any adverse effects of too much fructose on blood biomarkers so for this test when taking the sum of fructose plus half of sucrose because sucrose is uh fructose bound to glucose so half of sucrose is fructose when summing them together i get a total fructose for this test of 56 and half gram per day which may seem like a lot but that's close to my lowest of 56.2 gram per day and i've been able to make another fructose cut so expect to see fructose being a bit lower than 56.2 my lowest ever for test number six which is scheduled for around 2 weeks from today all right what about micronutrients so the full list of vitamins as shown here and for anyone starting on this journey i i always recommend covering the rdas now how high you should go above the rdas is very debatable and uh probably very individual what works for me may not work for others in terms of how high or not to go for for specific vitamins and minerals just to highlight a couple uh in terms of full rda coverage it looks like choline is not above the rda but unfortunately chronometer doesn't have chine data for sardines when adding the choline from sardines i cover the rda there and also for vit vin d that looks like that's not meeting the rda but as we saw in the last video infrequent vitamin d supplementation plus infrequent sun exposure and i'd love to get more sun exposures there just isn't too many cloudy days and rainy days in boston in the summer unfortunately uh but we we saw in the last video that the even with infrequent vitamin d and infrequent sun exposure circulating levels of vitamin d were 38 nanog per mill which is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes so all good there many other micronutrients are purposely much higher than the rda and that's because i'm following correlations with blood biomark blood and other biomarkers including blood pressure and if you're interested in that data it's on the correlations tier on patreon so check it out for comparison let's bring up test number four and highlight niin so for this test i purposely raised it a bit higher to around 71 milligrams per day the majority of that coming from nicotinic acid with the goal of increasing nad and you can see for test number four it was 42 milligram per day and rather than just assuming that those levels can have a positive impact or not on ned i measured it and on the day of testing for test number five it was around 28 micromolar in conjunction with that 71 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day but for test number four with a lower nasin nicenic acid intake we can see that ned was on the lower side and that's that's probably my lowest uh limit for ned that that's where i started to see uh strength decrements so the goal is to keep it nad away from 20 micro and keep it closer to 30 and that's the goal for the next test to increase uh nicotinic acid and total nin to around 80 mg per day that might not seem like a big jump but the goal is small you know progress i'm not trying to again i'm not trying to blow up the system but make small targeted changes all right what about minerals so we can see that listed here for test number five and then bringing up test number four for comparison so first we can see that calcium intake was about 100 milligrams higher and i did that on purpose by because i increased collard green intake collard greens are a low oxalate containing vegetable that are rich in calcium and because they're low and oxalate that and because i'm increasing calcium intake when're considering that calcium binds to oxalate and then it it's excreted that limits how much oxalate is absorbed so the goal was to increase calcium by a little bit you know more relative to the last test so i can potentially further reduce oxalate absorption and then maybe see if any biomarkers changed as a result of that all right also note that copper it was 1 milligram lower which may not seem like a lot relative to test number four but that's a 25% decrease and also zinc was a little bit lower too both of those are related to decreasing mushroom intake and decreasing uh cacao beans which are my two major sources of copper and zinc and then also we can see selenium i increased that to the tolerable upper limit and that's not from supplementation that's just from diet with the brazil nuts and other foods like sardines which are selenium rich you can see that for this test it was was around 400 mig per day and that was a further increase relative to test number four but again no impact on thyroid hormone uh markers like free t3 and free t4 all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where besides posting daily uh the diet you know updates every couple of month a couple of months after a blood test i post diet data every day so you get to see the day-to-day uh struggle for how how i'm running the show or how i'm running the approach but then i also have cor biomicro correlations on patreon so after every test i calculate correlations for diet macros and micros with at least 25 uh standard clinical chemistry biomarkers so if you're interested in that check it out but i also have been posting uh full metabolomic and epigenetic correlations there too so it's a lot more than just 25 biomarkers in their correlations with diet i also posst daily data for heart rate variability resting heart rate sleep stages and then if you want to check out early videos before they're posted on youtube and ad free and i also provide blood test consults so if any of that interests you check it out we've also got a bunch of discount links and affiliates that you can use to test yourself while also helping to support the channel including ulta
