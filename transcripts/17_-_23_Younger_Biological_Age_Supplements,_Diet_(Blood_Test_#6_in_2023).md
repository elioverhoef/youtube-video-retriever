# 17 - 23 Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Blood Test #6 in 2023)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that my biological age when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age was se about 17 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai it was about 23 years younger so what's contributing to these data so first let's take a look at supplements and if you're familiar with the channel the first two shouldn't be a surprise as i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early 20s early to mid 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin about 140 micrograms per day ever since the second is vitamin d i supplement with vitamin d 8 to n months out of the year when i'm unable to get full body sun exposure uh for this test it was 1,000 ius per day which i've since increased and i'll have that in an upcoming video for the why so note that i supplemented with vitamin d4 20 of the 49 days that corresponded to this test so what does that mean so the 49 days that corresponded to this test are from august 21st through october 10th of 2023 and why specifically those days is because august 21st was the date of test number five so immediately after test number five through the day before test number six which was on october 8th that's a 49-day period and that lines up with the blood test data for blood test number six all right so for the third supplement i supplemented with methyl b12 1,000 micrograms per day for 46 of the 49 days that correspond to this test to try to reduce homosysteine as the serene plus vitamin b6 experiment didn't work and i'll have that data in an upcoming video i also supplemented with fish oil epa plus dha 2.1 g per day for 18 days to potentially impact nad and if you miss that video i'll put it in the right corner now note that that was early in this 49-day period from august 24th through september 10th and it didn't work it didn't raise nad so i took it out of the approach and then last for supplements but not least i supplemented with nicotinic acid again only this time a far lower dose than the 650 migr per day that increased my ned very high to 67 micromolar this time i used a 10 times lower dose of 60 mig per day and i did that for 13 days and later in this period so uh from september 22nd through october 4th and i purposefully ended it a few days before the blood test because i'm not yet sure if nin itself is messing up my epigenetic pace of aging d and pace so i ended it a few days early before the test because i didn't want to mess up my epigenetic pace of aging still waiting on those results for ned we'll see if even a small dose of nin was able to increase nad so stay tuned for that in an upcoming video all right so that's it for supplements uh which then brings us to diet so what diet composition corresponds to this test and that's what we'll see here this is the average daily dietary intake over that 49-day period that corresponds to test number six now note that i weigh my food every day and i record that data in chronometer and then log all of that into an excel file so these data are as close to one can get as exact in terms of how much i was eating for each of these foods now i rank the foods based on the left from 1 to 25 and on the right from 26 to 50 so i ate 50 different foods and these foods are ranked in terms of amounts in grams with the exception of green tea which is an ounces and if you're familiar with the channel the foods that are at the top of this list have been purposely consistent in 2023 that's because after 45 blood tests since 2015 this diet including macro and micronutrients is consistently associated with relatively youthful biomarker data with a few exceptions of course horvath's epigenetic age homocysteine but for the most part it's a mostly youthful biomarker profile now i did make a few changes for this test in terms of dietary intake relative to test number five and that's because i try to alter my oral microbiome by changing some of the foods that are associated with bacteria in my mouth that can reduce sadium maresin or potentially can reduce sadium maresin so those foods included increasing red bell pepper increasing yogurt and increasing pistachio not big increases very small increases um as i don't want to blow up the system for one variable the oral microbiome and mess up potentially mess up blood biomarkers so i made very small increases to follow the correlations with bacteria again that can potentially reduce sadium maresin and then those are the foods that i increased but i also reduced a few foods including mushrooms and onions under the same premise that these foods were associated with a bacterial profile an oral bacterial profile that may have been able to reduce sadium maresins which is 95% of my oral microbiome which is just outrageous but it didn't work and i'll have that data in an upcoming video now to meet my total fat goal of about 80 grams per day by increasing pistachios that means i had to reduce something else and the in this case it was almond so i made a small cut to almonds to accommodate that small increase for pistachios and i also added in two eggs per week uh one each on workout days with the premise that uh if i increase dietary choline intake especially from eggs eggs are a rich source of choline that might be able to help reduce homocysteine to get it away from my age expected data where it currently is and to get it to more youthful values and just as a quick aside my foliate intake is 2.5x the rda i'm supplementing with vitamin b12 tmg in the past trimethyl glycine uh didn't work up to 3 gram per day to reduce homocysteine and the serene plus vitamin b6 experiment three times three different doses didn't work so choline could be one area where i can increase uh potentially increase it to reduce homocysteine as i'm generally only around the rda for that nutrient all right so the diet isn't always purposefully clean i try to include no more than two cheat meals per dietary period that corresponds to each test as if i go above that it can start to lead to an obsession with junk and then that can trigger a binge and that's i'm trying to completely avoid that so two is my limit two i try to make no more than two cheat meals per dietary period and for this test it was chocolate chips mixed with peanut butter as a homemade reese's peanut butter cup i'm addicted to it what can i say uh it tastes great so on the immediately after test number six and the day after i mixed the chocolate chips with peanut butter so that 4.7 gram per day average isn't everyday it's exclusively on 2 days and when calculating the calories from chocolate chips it was about 1,200 calories which equates to 1 1% of my total calorie intake for this period so 99% clean 1% junk all right so this list is ranked in grams what about foods ranked in terms of calories for top contributors for uh test number six and that's what we'll see here so note that these data are tracked with chronometer and if you want to measure your own diet with chronometer that link will be in the video's description so at top the list as it's been for many tests now are sardines so i get the sardines are my number one food in terms of where i'm getting the majority of my c calories from and then in terms of the remaining foods on the top 10 list nine of these foods are the same as they were for the first five tests in 20123 with the exception of coconut butter which didn't make the this list at 89 calories per day just you can see the top 10 is 93 calories per day so coconut butter just barely missed the cut and then what entered into the top 10 for this test are collared greens whereas for test number five they are at 85 calories per day for this test 97 g per day and i did that on purpose follow following corations for vitamin k with collard greens being a great source of vitamin k with hdl and that may actually be one reason why my hdl has now been higher than 50 for four consecutive tests again i'll have that data in an upcoming video too all right what about macronutrient composition how does that correspond to test number six so first starting with calorie intake it was 21 2,15 calories per day which you may have seen me say this a lot but that's my again my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015 with 2122 for test number five being my previous low so i've been trying to make very small cuts to calorie intake over a very long period of time with the goal of sustaining whatever fat loss that i've or whatever fat that i've gotten rid of over the past year or so all right in terms of macros and protein intake i average 95 grams per day which is another quick aside is about 1.5 g per kilogram of body weight with 1.6 g uh of protein per kilogram body weight being close to the maximum what's been reported to maximize muscle mass as a result of strength strength training so i'm pretty close to that at 95 gram per day i may go a little bit higher though but that's where it was for this test protein intake accounted for about 18% of total calories all right so what about fat intake and that's what we can see here average daily fat intake was about 81 gram per day which is about 35% of total calories and if you're interested in how total fat breaks down including monop po poly on saturated omega3 omega 6 saturated trans fats and cholesterol all of that data is listed there all right so what about carb carb intake carbohydrate intake that's what we can see here so total carbs are about 290 gram per day which superficially seems like a lot but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake for this test was 83 gram per day and again this is a 49 day average not the day before the test but for all 49 days in between test number five and test number six so fiber was 83 g per day and when subtracting that from net carbs we get uh total carbs we get a net carbs of 207 gram per day multiplying that by four calories per gram we get that my diet for this test was about 39% net carbs now note that fiber also provides calories as soluble fiber within total fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acid so some percentage of the total fiber is converted into fat and for this test it was 176 calories so it's about two calories per gram coming from the fiber uh intake that can be added to the total fat so that uh just to note that total fat uh total fiber contributed about 8.3% of the calories of total calorie intake so now we can calculate my net macros by adding the 8% to the 35% for total fat to get to yield a 43% fat for average fat intake every day about 30 9% net carbs and about 18% protein and note that i didn't start off on this path with those percentages in mind i've let the blood biomarkers guide what the diet should be and i've settled on this diet because it seems to yield the best biomarker profile all right so within total carbs i also track sugar intake and more specifically total fructose so fructose and sucrose note that sucrose is half fructose so when dividing that by two and adding that to fructose we get a total fructose of about 58 grams per day for this test now that may seem like a lot but that's once again i should say close close to my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracking in 2015 with 57.5 gram per day my lowest fructose intake and i've had fructose intakes that are double that so i've mentioned this in other videos but 58 grams per day is actually a small win compared to my normal or my usual or what i would normally eat um if i wasn't trying to quote unquote restrict fr somewhat restrict fructose intake all right what about micronutrient profile so we'll start off first with vitamins and this may be hard to see so i'd recommend going full screen if you haven't already so i won't highlight everything but i just want to note that i've got full rda coverage and that many micronutrients are purposefully higher than the rda as i'm following correlations with blood biomarkers just to highlight one of them vitamin k you can see is more than 2300 micrograms per day an adequate adequate intake or what the rda is is somewhere around 100 micrograms depending on if you're a man or a woman so i'm 23x the rda for vitamin k and not by any random luck it's following correlations with the blood biomarkers and that amount seems to be again part of the approach for correlations with an overall blood biomarker profile that's mostly youthful all right so next up is mineral intake and if you're interested in how my mineral intake looks i've listed it fully there all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging including daily data for food intake macro and micronutrients and food composition i post that daily on patreon we've also got discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic and t testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing including aple b including a panel using cy fox health that's different from the metabolomic so they're somewhat complimentary kits die tracking with chronometer green tea or if you like like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die ching brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
