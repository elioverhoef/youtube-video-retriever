# HRV, RHR: What's Contributing To Improvements Since 2018?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that i've significantly increased my average daily heart rate variability from 47 milliseconds per day in 2018 to about 64 milliseconds per day through the first six months of 2023 which is a 35 increase conversely for the resting heart rate after starting with an average daily resting heart rate of about 51 beats per minute in 2018 i've significantly reduced that to about 44 beats per minute through the first six months of 2023 which is a 14 decrease so what's contributing to these or what's potentially contributing to these improved data for the heart rate variability and resting heart rate since 2018 as a higher heart rate variability in conjunction with a lower resting heart rate is moving towards more youthful values so the most obvious impact on these metrics on heart rate variability and resting heart rate is exercise training so let's start off by taking a look at that so to track exercise training or regular exercise i use the average daily heart rate or adhr as an index of daily physical activity and that's in contrast with using step counts and this value is provided by myfitness tracker and i wear whoop not affiliated or sponsored so what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with next day heart resting heart rate and that's what we can see here with the resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against the average daily heart rate on the x and here we can see a significant positive correlation the correlation coefficient lowercase r is 0.63 and we can see that that p-value is less than 0.05 in fact that's a very i hate to say very significant but 10 to the negative 134 it's a significant correlation in other words too much daily activity too often is bad for my resting heart rate so what's the core what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with heart rate variability and that's we can see here so in this case we've got an inverse correlation in other words too much daily activity too often is bad for my heart rate variability so together from these two plots we can see that the higher my average daily heart rate is that's significantly correlated with worse data for heart rate variability and resting heart rate so with that in mind finding the balance between active and rest days is important for optimizing both of these metrics so what does that look like so here's a screenshot of a seven day period at the end of may in 2023 and before every workout i try to have as low of at as low of activity as possible so that i'm close to fully recovered in terms of cv metrics prior to workout days which are here the 58 and 57b per minutes beats per minute are workout days and then after a workout day so my usual workout is an 80 minute workout this is standardized i've been doing it for years full body workout including weights calisthenics flexibility mobility balance etc i won't get into that in this video but what i want to highlight is after the workout day i purposely titrate activity downward such that the average daily heart rate is less for at least two days after the workout which enables the heart rate variability and resting heart rate to recover sufficiently prior to the next workout so the next workout after that 50 2 was then the 57 after which i titrated activity lower again for the two days after that and then probably did a workout on that third day so it's a three day cycle now it's not a perfect system sometimes it takes an extra day of having a relatively low adhr before doing the workout but this is what works for me maybe for others they can work out more often but this is what works for me all right so physical activity pa isn't the only variable that may affect resting heart rate and heart rate variability and with that in mind what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate let's start with the resting heart rate and go into heart rate variability next so here we're going to take a look at my average monthly body weight values from august of 2018 through june of 2023 and we're also going to take a look at the plot we're going to look at a plot for the average monthly heart rate over that same time period and note that my body weight is recorded every morning after using the bathroom and fasted so when looking at these plots for the body weight on the left and the resting heart rate on the right there are some obvious trends especially during periods when i've lost weight and note that this is intentional weight loss as i'm i've always wanted to be as lean as possible during periods when i've lost weight resting heart rate has declined and conversely during periods when i've gained weight resting heart rate has increased now this is just gross morphological data we're just looking at overall trends what about more specifically is body weight significantly correlated on its own on a daily basis with resting heart rate so here we're going to take a look at daily data for the resting heart rate versus body weight and this is from august of 2018 when i first started tracking through the end of june 2023 first half of 2023 and note that little n that's almost 1800 days of data so when looking at the plot for resting heart rate on the y-axis versus body weight we can see a significant positive correlation in other words as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with higher resting heart rates in my data and conversely as my body weight has approached 144 pounds the resting heart rate has approached 43 beats per minute now extrapolating on this plot raises an interesting question what will resting heart rate look like if i'm able to further reduce body weight and i should say more specifically body fat as again i'm always trying to be as lean as possible based on dexa that i did in december of 2022 when i was 151 pounds my body fat percentage was about 12 percent so at 140 pounds assuming i lose no muscle mass no lean mass just pure fat mass that's lost i'll be about five to six percent uh body fat which is pretty close to my lowest limit so what will that look like in terms of the resting heart rate if i'm able to get there so stay stay tuned for that data in a future video all right so what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability so in terms of looking at the average monthly heart rate variability which is now shown on the right although it doesn't look as similar as the resting heart rate plot in terms of overlap with body weight there are some trends during periods where i've lost body weight heart rate variability has increased and during at least one period where i've gained body weight heart rate variability has decreased all right what about more specific data in terms of body weights correlation with heart rate variability and that's what we'll see here using the same setup that we did for the resting heart rate daily heart rate variability data versus daily body weight data with about 1800 days of data and that's what's shown here so now we see a significant inverse correlation in other words as my body weight has been higher that's significantly correlated with lower heart rate variability and conversely as my body weight has approached 144 pounds heart rate variability has approached relatively higher values 75 milliseconds and just like we did for the resting heart rate what will this trend look like what will these data look like as you can see i have no data from about 144 pounds to 140 what will heart rate variability look like if i'm able to get closer to 140 will it get close to 80 milliseconds i don't know we'll see so we can see from both these data for resting heart rate and heart rate variability that they approve approach youthful values as body weight decreases at least in my case i can't say if this would be true for others all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing and telomere testing which is also included in that test or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their biomarker panel is mostly different from the at-home metabolomics and also includes apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
