Ergothioneine extends lifespan so let's have a look at that data so here we have survival plotted on the y-axis against days elapsed or lifespan on the x and this is data in fruit flies more specifically the canton s strain so when looking at 50 survival this is the time when half of the fruit fly colony has died and half is still alive we can assess median lifespan so when compared with the control diet ck in dark blue there was an extension of lifespan for eat intermediate doses of ergothioneine from 10 micromolar to 100 micromolar and 1 millimolar with median lifespan increases of 11 to 15 percent also relatively smaller doses of ergothioneine included including 100 nanomolar and relatively higher doses of ergothioneine 10 millimolar significantly increased lifespan one and two percent now note that this is the first study to evaluate the impact of ergothioneine in lifespan there are no studies in mammals yet so i thought that this was an interesting study to cover all right what about lifespan and male flies so again this is the canton s strain of fruit fly and again we're looking at survival so when looking at 50 survival and when compared with the lifespan of the control diet ck ergothioneine supplemented flies that had one molar and 100 micromolar of ergothione in their in their diet lived nine percent and 12 percent longer for a medium lifespan when compared with the control diet but interestingly there was also a decrease in lifespan for a relatively lower intake of ergothioneine one micromolar so a six percent decreased lifespan when compared with the control diet now note that we've got a lifespan extension but now we also have lifespan shortening so uh interestingly the authors of the study decided to look at ergothioney's potential effect on lifespan in a different fruit fly strain the y at yw strain and that's what we can see here so did ergothioneine affect lifespan in a separate uh fly strain so in other words a different genetic background when compared with the cantonese strain so again we're looking at the yw strain for fruit flies and when looking at the 50 survival we're compared with the control diet in dark purple ck we can see now again there's a significant increase in lifespan for the intermediate doses of ergothioneine one millimolar and 100 micromolar but also again we have a significant decrease in lifespan too for relatively lower 100 nanomolar and relatively higher 10 millimolar for ergothioneine so again we've got this lifespan extension but also lifespan shortening so what about in the male uh yw strain of fruit flies so again going right to 50 survival when compared with the control diet dark purple or dark blue ck again we have that increased lifespan for the intermediate doses of methionine 100 micromolar and 10 micromolar so seven and six percent increase in median lifespan but again we have a small but significant decrease in median lifespan for the rel for a relatively higher dose of ergothioneine 10 millimolar and actually if you look at the light blue and brown there are two curves to the left meaning there there's a decreased lifespan decreased median lifespan for the lowest doses one micromolar and 100 nanomolar but these weren't statistically significant so uh from this data we can see that both relatively lower and higher amounts of ergothioneine reduce lifespan but what also happened in this study is that consistently 100 micromolar as i've put in this green rectangle for each of the fly strains cantonese and the yw and in both male and female flies a hundred micromolar of erythiamine significantly extended lifespan in both fly strains and in both genders so the big question is how is it doing that so is it a mild calorie restriction cr so to assess that the authors of this study looked at food intake which is what's on the y-axis and then they looked at flies at two different ages so 10 day old flies and 30 day old flies and note that the maximum lifespan for the flies in this study was somewhere around 110 days so these are still very young flies and then they recorded food intake after one hour feeding and 48 hours of feeding so in the very young flies at 10 days old we can see that there is no difference when comparing the control diet with the ergothioneine supplemented flies so young young flies had no difference in food intake whether feeding for an hour or for 48 hours and similarly there was no difference in food intake for the flies are a little bit older 30 days old whether feeding for an hour or feeding for 48 hours so from this we can conclude there is no difference in food intake and that kind of rules out that rules out that calorie restriction is not responsible for ergothioneine's lifespan extending effect and note that this study that they did for the feeding was uh with ergothioneine at 100 micromolar in in their food so uh that's the dose that was shown to extend lifespan in both fly strains and in both male and female fly so uh for all the experiments uh the data that i'm going to show it was at that 100 micromolar dose that extended lifespan for basically all of the fly data that i just showed all right so what about the gut microbiome so to assess whether the gut microbiome was involved in the lifespan extending effect of ergothioneine they treated the flies both the control ck and ergothioneine supplemented with antibiotics so a zenith flies means that the flies are treated with antibiotics in order to deplete the gut microbiome and what we can see by looking at 50 survival is that there is no increase in either median or even in the maximal even though i didn't put an arrow there in terms of comparing the ergothione antibiotic treated versus the control diet antibiotic treat treatment so that suggests that because the uh lifespan data is the same for the ergothioneine now versus the controls when treated both with antibiotics that suggest that the gut microbiome is responsible for this for this lifespan extending effect of ergothioneine because the lifespan extending effect goes away when the flies are treated with antibiotics now the authors of this study didn't go further into how that may be uh the case so i'm looking forward to future studies that can uh help tease that data out how is the microbiome uh affecting ergothioneine's effects on lifespan at least in flies so what they did find is that there was also there was reduced oxidative stress so in addition to the effect of the gut microbiome on lifespan ergothioneine supplemented flies had reduced oxidative stress so how did they measure oxidative stress well they used the gsh to gssg ratio gsh being glutathione gssg being um glutathione disulfide which is uh basically oxidized two two uh two molecules of glue glutathione get oxidized and they basically stick together to from one molecule of gssg so that ratio the gsg gsh to gssg ratio is a measure of oxidative stress so why is it a measure of oxidative stress so here we can see that starting with gsh glutathione in the presence of a mild oxidant in this case a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 glutathione becomes oxidized thereby thereby forming a gssg so we can see that in very young flies that were 10 days old there was no difference in the gsh to gssg ratio for the very young flies but then for 30 day old flies we can see first that the gsh gssg ratio is dramatically reduced when compared with the very young flies for both the control diet and the ergothioneine supplemented in blue but then the ergothione supplement that had less oxidative stress as indicated by this ratio were compared with the flies that were on the control control diet so how is this happening why is the gshg ssg ratio increased in ergothioneine supplemented flies and one reason is because the flies that were fed ergothioneine had increased antioxidant levels which is what we can see here so first we're looking at sod and cat so what what is that so uh in the presence of superoxide which is uh delineated there superoxide dismutase converts it uh well the enzyme superoxide dismutase otherwise known as sod converts that superoxide into the less toxic hydrogen peroxide and then catalase can degrade that hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen so s sod and cat are very important for antioxidant defense especially against superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide so first looking at the data in the very young flies that were 10 days old we can see that there was no difference in sod or a cat so no difference in these antioxidant enzymes at very young ages but then for both the 30 day old and the 50 day old flies uh we can see significant increases for both sod and cat in the ergothioneine fed flies when compared with the control diet so we've got increased antioxidant levels that makes explain this improvement in the gsh gssg ratio that in the ergothioneine supplement that flies when compared with controls all right so which foods are rich in ergothioneine as a means for getting this into our diet where can we get it from from food and i i already have an ergothioneine video if you missed that i'll put that in the right corner so i've covered some of this before but let's just go through it so here we're looking at ergothioneine content in milligrams of ergothioneine per kilogram of food in dry weight dw so oats kidney beans and oprah have very small amounts of ergothioneine and then we can see higher amounts for garlic chicken liver mexican asparagus and then the soy product tempe but far and above the all-star for ergothioneine content is mushrooms as we can see white button mushrooms and great oyster mushrooms have far more ergothioneine content where compared with all the other foods on this list so mushrooms are a concentrated source of ergothioneine but then also note they also contain sperminine which has also been shown to extend lifespan and i'm not a fan of the term superfoods uh but can when considering that mushrooms have both ergothioneine and spermidine uh metabolites now that are both shown to increase increase lifespan you know i'd be tempted to call it a superfood now note that from my most recent blood test for the 42 day period that uh went from my blood test number five to blood test number six that 40 to 42 day period i averaged 166 and a half grams of mushroom mushrooms per day now when considering that ergothioneine can increase but also decrease lifespan is my mushroom intake too much just right or not enough so by tracking food intake and blood biomarkers in other words the big picture biomarkers that i presented in many recent videos by looking at correlations between that between food intake in this case mushrooms with the big picture biomarkers that can help identify the mushroom dose that may be optimal for health and potentially longevity we won't know longevity because we'd have to live out you know the remainders of our lives uh so now i only have one dietary period that corresponds to one blood test so i'll need many more blood tests with track dietary data in order to start start looking at correlations for mushroom intake on the big picture biomarkers but i fully intend to make a video on that at some point in the upcoming future all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoy the video have a great day
