# 17.6y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #5 In 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

If we can flatten mortality risk can we optimize health and potentially lifespan so let's take a look at what i mean by that in this plot on the y- axis we've got the death rate plotted against age on the x starting from birth through people who are older than 95 years old and what we can see is that the death rate in newborns up until 1 years old is very high and then death rates are decline such that the lowest risk of death for all causes is when we're 10 to 14 years old but then afterwards death rates close to linearly increase as shown by the red arrows as we age now instead of having that age related increase for the mortality rate what if we could flatten it such that it doesn't linearly increase for every year that we're alive after 14 years old so then the question is how can we do that well aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades they don't just happen out of nowhere and apologies if you've heard this a billion times but this is the central premise of the channel and how i think that we can flatten the mortality risk or flatten mortality risk potentially optimize health and lifespan so with that in mind if we track and optimize towards youth optimize biomarkers towards youth and push them towards lowest risk of death for all causes whether it's by using uh exercise diet supplements etc so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can we slow ag ing and minimize disease risk with the goal of maximizing longevity so with that in mind uh late in late july i blood tested for the fifth time in 2024 and note that this is blood test number 53 time uh since 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator which me is a metric of biological a age and if you have blood test data and you want to measure your own biological age using this test there'll be a downloadable ex excel link in the video's description so when i enter the nine biomarkers as shown here i get a biological age of 33.9 years which is 17.6 years younger than my chronological now rather than just looking at data enter into into a spreadsheet i'll have screenshots of the lab test report coming up in just a bit but it's important to note that this is just one test we shouldn't get too high or too low over one test but tracking year-to-year changes i think is more important for being able to flatten that mortality risk flatten you know flatten that baseline in terms of mortality risk so with that in mind let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 as i have 34 tests over that 6 plus year period as shown here now when i first started tracking in 2018 to 2019 over three tests average biological age using lavine's feno age was 36.1 years but three tests over a 2-year span may not be representative of year-to-year changes so i started testing more often six times each in 2020 and 2021 so 12 tests over that 2-year period with an average biological age using this test of 35.6 years so that's probably closer to my true year-to-year uh average relative to the 2018 to 2019 data and then i had my best year-to date in 2022 over seven tests with an average biological age of 33.8 years it got a bit worse to 34 .7 years in 2023 but still better than 2020 and 2021 data and thus far after the first five tests in 2024 i'm back to my best data at 33.8 years so what we can see from these 34 tests is that i've potentially slowed biological age i would never say that i've reversed it this is the live long enough to live forever approach as all and i can't undo the first 51 years of of living with where who knows what my biological age and what these biomarkers look like prior to 2015 even though i do have some sporadic data but i can only control what i can going forward so the goal is to have as many biomarkers close to youth and what's associated with lowest risk of death for all causes for the next 70 plus years or as long as my genetic uh uh lifespan will allow so all right let's jump into the blood test data because i don't just focus on these nine b markers there are some other highlights and also there is room for improvement and that's what we'll see here now what i first want to highlight is that i've been using quest for many tests and one reason for that is you can see that i blood tested in the morning 716 in the morning is when when the blood was drawn and results were available within 24 hours which to me is just fantastic just going to my uh doctor in the past the results take probably about a week which is just too slow now to do that i i have't been going through my doctor but as i mentioned in the last video on lead i've been using ulta laab test altalab test.com and i've got an affiliate link there if you want to uh help support the channel so basically i go to altalab test.com and i order all of the tests that i want i bring them to quest pay the $10 uh blood draw fee and then as i mentioned i got results all of the results that i've shown here within 24 hours some some results do take longer like i measured candida antibodies that took about a week uh home assistin took about two or 3 days somewhere in that ballpark but for the standard chem panel and uh u um cbc one business day which is fantastic in my eyes all right so some highlights hdl 54 mig per deciliter is now in the optimal range 50 to 60 migs per deciliter i covered that in an earlier video if you missed it it'll be in the right corner now hdl is now greater than 50 for 10 tests in a row with an average over that 10 test period of 55 mg per deciliter for comparison for the 43 tests since 2015 15 prior to those 10 tests hdl average was 44.7 mg per dcil and when using a two sample t test that compare those two groups of data i've significantly improved it over the past 10 tests also note that hs high sensitivity c reactive protein is again less than3 mg per liter which is below the or is their limit of detection so that's the 18th consecutive test where i've had hscp less than3 mg per liter and it looks like quest has actually made a an improvement uh in reducing the limit of detection from. 3 to0 2 which let's see if i can keep it below 02 going forward also glucose which was 98 on the high side for my last test blood test number four uh returned too close to my average at 88 milligram per deciliter now what was behind that i can't say with uh much certainty but i did make a couple of changes that may have made an impact i removed branch chain amino acid supplementation so i supplemented with 5 g per day prior to the last test so for this test i removed that and then i also reduced fat intake from an average of 93 to 83 g per day so why i think those two factors may be involved in the glucose reduction going from 98 back to 88 is because a relatively higher protein intake and fat intake in my correlation so that 50 plus blood test data since 2015 that's significantly correlated with higher glucose in my data so cutting protein the branch chain amino acids and cutting fat intake may be part of the reason why i was able to bring glucose back to 88 from 98 from the past test all right on to page two so additional highlights egfr which is measure of kidney function in this case it's derived from creatinine levels are 106 egfr at 106 so that's uh 20 years younger than expected based on my chronological age and we can see that why that that's true here on the y-axis we've got the gfr estimate so egfr plotted against age and we can see that in this stud of about 386,000 people an egfr of 106 would be the average value for someone around 30 years old whereas someone of my chronological age 51 years uh has an average value of around 70 so that's about a 20 year better than expected egfr based on chronological age now the other side of that story is that creatinine levels are proportional to muscle mass my workout performance in terms of strength and everything else hasn't changed dramatically over the past few months uh no obvious major differences in terms of that so i find it hard to believe that a reduction in creatinine would be uh because of a reduction in muscle mass body weight is the same too and no change in workout frequency duration intensity uh or any of that also note albumin at five is on the high side of the range which is good news because albumin levels decline during aging and relatively lower levels of albumin are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk all right so now for some potential weak spots and room for improvement so the liver enzymes a and alt at 26 aren't terrible i've had higher higher values than that in the past but lowest risk of death for all causes for th those two liver enzymes is closer to the low 20s so i've got some room uh for improvement to bring those down thyroid hormones free t4 and free t3 i'm trying to increase free t3 and reduce free t4 in other words improve the conversion of free t4 into free t three as that conversion worsens with aging uh so to do that for this test i averaged 404 mg of selenium per day so there was 59 days in between blood tests so selenium intake for that 59-day period was an average of 404 milligram per day and i did that almost exclusively by increasing brazil nut intake now i didn't measure plasma levels of uh selenium to see if i was able to increase selenium in blood via an increase in dietary intake so uh that could be something that i look at in the future but i'm pretty confident that uh what's in the brazil nuts should represent uh a higher blood level of selenium so with that in mind i've got to come up with a different approach other than increasing selenium which is a required co-actor for conversion of t4 to t3 uh which is why i did that selenium increas selenium uh experiment to potentially increase the conversion of t4 to t3 so i've got to come up with a different approach to try to improve or increase free t3 while reducing free t4 m cv at which is the average red blood cell volume uh so do you have very large red blood cells or very small red blood cells the mcv increases during aging 94.2 is on the high side of my data over the past 50 plus tests and that's going in the wrong direction and i have some ideas based on correlations of my data which i post on patreon for why that may may be the case so uh that may be the focus of a future video so if you're interested in that uh check it out and then lymphocytes so 154 7 is better than my past two tests which have been on the low side but my past three tests for lymphocytes have been relatively low including this test with a three test average of 1443 for comparison for the previous 47 tests since 2015 average lymphocytes were 1902 and values for lymphocytes around 2000 is the average value for someone in their early 20s and values of around 2,000 for lymphocytes is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes and if you miss that data it'll be in the video in the right corner so i've got some work to do to figure out why my lympocytes have declined and what i can do to bring them back to closer to 1900 and even better around 2,000 now what i haven't gotten into yet is what diet composition and supplements correspond to these data and i started working on that video it'll be uh ready for uh youtube next week all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack ag aging check us out on patreon where i offer blood test content conss and before

blood testing with sciox health which includes apop but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for
