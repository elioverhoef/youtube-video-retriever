# Vitamin B6: Did It Increase NAD? (Test Results)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Vitamin b6 did it impact nad in an earlier video we saw that tryptophan is converted by the de novo nad synthesis pathway as shown here into nad but an age-related decline for vitamin b6 otherwise known as paradoxal 5-phosphate or plp may limit conversion of tryptophan into nad so with that in mind if i increase vitamin b6 intake will intracellular levels of nad correspondingly increase so with that in mind for nad test number four on april 24th i sent blood samples 2 to infinity and there we can see that my nad levels were 30.1 micromolar now to put that into context for ginfinity's ranges we can see that that would qualify me as suboptimal but that doesn't answer the question of whether b6 made an impact moreover it doesn't address whether nad of an nad of 31 30.1 micromolar is progress or just normal variation so to address that let's take a look at how 30 micromolar compares with the data for tests one to one two and three so for test number one on january 23rd my intracellular level of nad was 25.6 micromolar and note that i wasn't taking an r or nmn but because i tracked my diet every day with weighing all of my food i know my average b6 intake for the 30-day period prior to this test was 3.2 milligrams of b6 per day and similarly my average niacin intake for the 30-day period prior to this test was 42 milligrams per day now note that both of these are at least two times higher than the rda so i was surprised to see that my nad levels were relatively low so after getting these test results about a week later i started supplementing with nmn so for the 21 day period prior to test number two i averaged 300 milligrams of nmn per day but still no impact on my nad level so i think it's fair to say that somewhere around the 25 micro mole range even with 300 milligrams of nmn is my baseline level of intracellular nad and note that b6 and niacin were similar to the first test 3.2 milligrams per day and 41.7 milligrams per day for the 21 day period prior to test number two so after getting the results for test number two about a week later i started supplementing with an even higher dose of nmn 1000 milligrams per day or one gram per day for the seven day period that preceded test number three on march 6th and there i finally saw progress with an intracellular nad level of 39.3 micromolar note this effect is probably specific to nmn because my b6 intake was the same as it was for the other test and niacin was in the same ballpark too 41 and a half milligrams per day so for test number four i removed that mn to do the b6 experiment and we can see that my average b6 intake for the 49 day period from test number three to the day before test number four was about three to four four-fold higher so from 3.2 milligrams per day average to 11.3 milligrams for the average for vitamin b6 more specifically for the 14 day period before the test i increased it even a little bit further so it's about five-fold higher as you can see there 15.6 average b6 intake before test number four and with these data in mind note that niacin was still in the ballpark and i saw that 30.1 micromolar level for intracellular levels of nad so when considering that my baseline nad was is about 25 micromolar 30 is progress so i think it's fair to say even though it's just one test that there was some small increase for nad with vitamin b6 supplementation now if this is a real effect if i go higher i'd expect to see a further increase for nad so that's the plan for test number five coming up relatively soon will going higher for vitamin b6 more than 30 milligrams per day so i'm going to double it above my current intake which would be 10 times higher than where i was for test number three will that further increase nad so stay tuned for that video at some point in the future all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any of the quantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatrine brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
