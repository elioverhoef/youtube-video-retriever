# 62-Year Old Dave Pascoe: Slowing Aging Inside And Out

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Hey everyone today's guest probably needs no introduction dave pasco so dave is all over the interwebs uh you probably know him as the quote-unquote 62-year-old longevity athlete whose epigenetic pace of aging beats brian johnson although he's chronolog chronologically older which is a harder thing to do and also not spending $2 million a year but as we'll get into it i think dave is completely underrated so with that welcome dave to the channel shucks thanks it's great to be here i'm glad we're finally meeting face to face yes i agree uh same so all right so let's let's and you know it's funny because it's like uh the superhero backstory like i i humbly say for everybody watching that i kind of look at what we're doing is like longevity superheroes where for you know for better or worse you know some of us are on the right track some maybe guiding others on the wrong track but um we're trying to live as healthily as possible for as long as possible and going beyond just that eat real food and exercise kind of mantra so um you know i kind of look at look at that as like longevity superhero so you're i see you as a longevity superhero so i kind of want to know the backstory you know how does batman become batman or superman become superman right so were you always interested in health and fitness as a kid or did that de develop how did that start off for you yeah you know i think i was always interested in health and fitness as a kid um one of my earliest influen i think was uh watching the movie rocky seeing sylvester stallone you know jogging through the streets i did the whole thing put on the sweatsuits would go out jogging early morning drink the raw eggs you know the whole the whole nine yards so that uh that had a big impact on me that was at what age like how old were you gosh that movie came out in what 75 76 so it would have been like 13 14 years old okay so then 13 home gym you know a joe bench press in the basement kind of thing yeah yeah well except that was out in the garage yeah all right so then like bodybuilding magazines were you into that also as a kid or it was just the rocky set it off not really just the rocky set it off and then you know of course right about that time i think i was transitioning maybe from junior or into junior high from junior high wasn't wasn't quite high school yet you know girls started paying attention to muscles right so that was that was a huge driver for me it's same same it was like i went to summer camp and i saw there were a couple of uh kids my age and the girls for whatever reason were flocking to them and i was like when i come back to this camp next summer i'm gonna get in the gym and do all the things so for me it was exactly exactly the same but uh so basically it was just rocky there weren't any other you know fitness motivators not really no yeah i think rocky did it for me and then what was your tri i'm gonna apologize my voice is a little horse i'm dealing with a summer cold so it keeps going in and out ah so quick side note my uh nighttime respiratory rate which is a marker of immune activation i for me it's only gone above well pretty close to 14 with vaccination so the three times i got vaccinated respiratory rate like 16 or higher so usually 13 and a half average so i know that if it starts to trickle in that direction i've got something funky going on for the past five days i'm like slowly creeping up and i don't know what it is um so it maybe summer cold just like you i don't know be on the lookout all right all right so so uh how many days a week what was the approach it was just like every day how many how many hours like how what was the initial approach oh yeah back then i had no plan i didn't know anything um i mean i still don't really know anything i'm still i'm still learning but um you know back then i was just screwing around in the backyard with the weights you know doing the bicep curls and stuff trying to get the the buys and tries looking good trying to build the chest um just did like what friends recommended i did have one friend that worked at a a place called biofit and uh he took me through a routine once there and it was one of those routines where they scream at you the whole time like you g come on push you know you wussy and you know i'm like i got yelled at enough at home by my parents i i didn't need that too so that that didn't appeal to me very much i i never understood i never understood when if you're under a bench just as an example and you have that personality type behind you like talking the whole time i'm basically like shut up let me focus on pushing the weight right so but some people some people respond differently you know so um yeah that wasn't my thing yeah all right so did you play high school sports or it was just like a no um i really really wanted to play football badly in all through elementary school i mean that was my dream i wanted to be like the high school quarterback you know that was i don't know that was that was my childh good fantasy right but um yeah about the time i was in junior high i got braces on my teeth and my parents said no way you're not playing any sports with braces on so that pretty much ruined all all my plans and then you know the working out didn't help much because i had braces on my teeth i had you know hair that was sticking out here because that's what everybody did right total dork absolute dork so yeah i wouldn't say total dork because total dork implies no fitness at all right i think the st stot ype which seems like a derogatory thing to say a dork right but i think the stereotype of a dork is someone who's just academic and not into training or fitness or any of these things right so i get that because i grew up the same exact way you know academic but hey so i don't know it's not about me it's about you but quick story i'm still interested maybe we can talk about that later h or or it's just one big mix right but i heard you on interviews and i find so many similarities between us it's just it's cool it's very cool this may be different though so junior high we had a football team after school like you know who which grade has the best football team kind of thing and i grew up playing football like the same like i wanted to play high school football because kids on my blog played high school football i looked up to them so anyway i played a lot this wasn't like i i was pretty good too so for a little guy so anyway seventh grade came around and the quote unquote popular kids had their friends on this little football team and i was like put me in the game i got so annoyed it was like they wouldn't put me in so so uh yeah anyway quick quick side story all right so then uh and i know that there's your high school experience that was a computer science like a hacking story a biohacker story but i don't know people if people are interested in that i'll direct them to where i don't know if you want to talk about that i'm trying not to get you in trouble no we can talk about a little i think probably the statute of limitations on thata run out so so wait so you had coding skills or you always interested in computer science yeah yeah i think uh i took my first computer class in 1977 it was fortran77 and loved it absolutely loved it but back in those days we were doing it on punch cards so i mean you can imagine we're sitting at this you know huge punch card machine which is like a giant typewriter it's got this stack of cards that you put in the hopper and you could only type in one statement at a time on one card and if you screwed that up you had to throw the card away start all over again with the next one and then you know if you imagine like all the different statements that you would have in a computer program your deck could be this big so i used to carry this uh well it was a camera case and cameras back then were pretty large it looked like a giant purse but it was stacked it was just about the right size to hold my deck of computer cards so i had that strapped over my shoulder and that's how i walked around the hall in high school you know with my dorky uh computer stack stack there but we could only run a program once per day because there was no computer were no terminals when we first started the uh the teacher would take this deck all of our decks collect them and he would drive over to our intermediate school district where they had the mainframe and he would run all these things as a batch job so we would get our results back the next day and find out oh geeez i had a syntax air h you know frustrating so it would take all week just to run one program that's yeah that's i can't even i i look at coding now and i can't even imagine back then in the prehistoric days of trying to code you know so it truly was prehistoric yeah good good name for it or good word for it but i guess there was a time where uh you hacked into the school database and uh this the the wrap went around school that somebody's hacking into the computer database and you were talking to your friend about that you know yeah well it wasn't just our school's database it was our county's database because it was their mainframe system um we had in our library there was a thing that you could sign up for it was called the michigan occupation information system and it was designed for high school students to be able to try to figure out what they wanted to do for a living so it would walk you through a series of questions just to see what your aptitudes were and your interests and then at the end it would spit out a list of things that you might you know have it might be inclined to do so i used to have a free hour and i would volunteer in the library to take other students through this many times students would sign up and then they wouldn't show up so i had just time to play with it myself but having been a programmer i knew that um you know not all programmers are very conscious about how they uh do bounds checking on input and so i thought well i'm going to start putting this thing to its paces and see how good they were with the coding and sure enough i just i do some creative inputting i found i could get the program to abort and then when it did i was at a command prompt at the base of the operating system and i could go anywhere i wanted to and of course i did so so what was the what was the goal i mean it was just to look around and see how what's under the hood or it was just yeah curiosity more than anything um it wasn't like i wanted to do anything malicious it was just i just really want really wanted to see what was out there so i started exploring all the different things that were in people's accounts and i found that there was a a professor somewhere that was working on a um it was a star wars game now back then games weren't graphical they were text based so you know you would type in that you're doing something and it would come back and say okay it it would like describe a scenario of what you're seeing and then you would have to guess what to do next so in playing this game it was it was pretty fun it would always bomb out at a certain point you know just it would hit an error and bomb and as the weeks went by this didn't get fixed and it was kind of annoying to me because i really really wanted to keep playing the game so i fixed it and that was my first mistake i made a change right and that was that was detected because apparently i guess the bug or the error had been confounding this person for a while and they couldn't get past it and all of a sudden now it was working they're like hey wait what's going on here yeah so lo and behold i was gosh i think i was just trying to think what year or what grade that was in i think that was like seventh grade i time frame i'm not exactly positive maybe it was 10 be 10th grade yeah because there was a senior that was in one of my computer classes that worked for the data center and we got talking one day and he starts bragging to me about how how cool his job is and how smart he is and he started telling me about this uh hacker that they were trying to track and i'm i was kind of fascinated and as he told me more i got kind of shocked because i'm realized wait this is me he's describing and so like now i'm just in total shock shock and awe about this story so i was like glued to his every word really so what did he do next you know what did you guys do and so he was telling me everything they were doing to find this person which just made me laugh because then i knew everything to avoid so i contined to poke around and pr around and just have a good old time out there and i could see every grade of every student in the entire school district the entire county and i could have changed any of those grades but i didn't dare because another change would have attracted a lot more attention but i really at that point i thought that there was only a couple of students that would have been capable of that and i would have been one of them they would have looked at so yeah i didn't touch that i'm glad you didn't take it further because you know the like the anonymous hackers and well grant i'm not i have nothing against anonymous don't add me anonymous my gosh but you know i'm sure you could painting a target on your face right now i hope not but you know in in a in a in a parallel universe maybe there's a dave that took it a step farther and then started changing it all kinds of stuff but which then brings me into uh uh movies and this is just the side i know off track but but it's on my on my list because i think uh you know i want people to get to know the full version that is you right so um when the matrix first came out were you just like uh related to it you know hacker right real world oh very much so yeah even before that i mean me and the movie war games came out right about the same time that i was doing my hacking and i'm like this is so cool because this is exactly what i'm doing wasn't touching any government systems and wasn't like invoking any thermonuclear war or anything like that thankfully um but yeah those kind of movies like really really got to me especially go say that again in the matrix especially yeah yeah just real quick the war games i completely forgot about that movie and like i can't i can't i can't believe this is like 50 years ago i can't believe it's crazy right so all right wait so the matrix so i guess you related more to war games than the matrix well at that time because that was the movie that came out when i was doing that i mean matrix came out so much later and i was a lot further along you know in that so right right i see i got for me matrix the matrix is in my all four of them i know people are like the first one is great and i relate to all four of those like in every in so many different ways but um and i had i had to go back and watch each one as the next one came out too just so i was refreshed and ready to go yeah so it sounds like that's not in your top list of top movies even though you've got the coding background and these you know well i mean i was a movie geek i would go see every movie that came to the theater the weekend that it came out so people at work always would ask me in fact i had um like a little blog back before blogs were even a thing it was hardcoded right i had like an excel spreadsheet of the movies that i saw that weekend and i raided them and i would have the list of the actors names that were in them and uh and so people at work would want copies of this so i'd have to put it out on the file server and everybody would download that so they'd know what to rent when it finally came to uh you know to dvd blust movies everything i saw everything hey it's like blockbuster de pasco right it's like you're the so wait so what would you say that since you're a movie buff what would you put like which what would you put as your top you know their top five as the movies you know for you uh oh gosh that would be impossible i know people have asked me that before and i really can't nail it down one movie that's was incredibly watchable that i saw probably the most was beverly hills cop i don't know why it was just a fun movie it had great pace to it yeah yeah that's a classic yeah so so sci-fi is not your oh sci-fi is my jam absolutely yeah like robocop really love that you know all the the star trek you know and the star wars um yeah i mean you name it time travel stuff really awesome alien what about the alien franchise prometheus that whole oh yeah that too and i know there's another one coming out soon on that so i'm kind of curious to see what they do with the reboot yeah it doesn't seem as good as what what's already been but you never know right so it's frustrating when they just keep rehashing stuff instead of coming up with new concepts yeah all right so okay so now we've got you out of high school coding coding and then college comes right so computer science major or what was yeah yeah double majored computer science and psychology psychology so what was the plan with the double major uh really no plan i was just fascinated with psychology so i did enough of the uh the coursework that i just needed 24 more credits in anything to actually have a double degree but i didn't think that there was really anything i could do with just a bachelor's in in psychology and i didn't want to become a social worker or anything like that i was just fascinated by people yeah i've heard that i've heard you say that about you just observed everyone around you like you're the observer right so i think you mentioned before that in high school you saw all of the other or some of the other kids like partying a lot and you you're like i see what that can lead to i don't want to go down that road so have you ever have you ever uh you know briggs meyers personality type do you know your personality type i you know wanted to do that in preparation for this just to see what it would be today and i didn't get to it so i apologize but you know i've taken tests like that in the past but it' be decades ago now and it used to be any kind of test like that that i took where there was a quadrant of things i would land right smack in the middle of all four quadrants interesting which i guess makes me a bit of a chameleon but yeah that's the best way i mean it's you know you get to understand it from all sides of the equation rather than polarized right both i try to be you know like that too but but uh but yeah so inj so that think that's the observer type you know that's like the uh yeah so but you'd have to you'd have to officially not that it means anything it's just you know intuitive thinking judging you know but then you've got people who are more empathetic and more feelings based so when not when i heard you talking about oh i observed because i've been like that for a long time too or maybe forever where you know it was similar i saw the party type party lifestyle and granted i did too some of that in college and a little bit afterwards but uh there is a bit of it with my personality to like peeling back and looking at the world from the outside in you know so i got a sense of that from you too yeah oh exactly i i think most of my life i felt like the ultimate outsider i mean so even as a kid my dad was kind of one of those that believe children should be seen and not heard and if i was seen or heard it wasn't going to be pretty so i usually just tried to keep my head down keep out of the way not you know not be seen um that saying the tall poppy syndrome like you know don't don't stand out for any reason interesting was very very much a self-preservation thing when i was growing up yeah so i don't know it's a tricky subject right because parenting back then was a completely different you know mindset than it is now for better or worse right in some ways maybe better but but also many ways many other ways you know i i get that too but i don't know how deep we want to go down that rabbit hole it's fine anything anywhere you want to go i'm totally willing so yeah um so wait so computer science psychology and then after that working in tech or how how did that yeah i got my first job in a direct mail marketing company which was kind of frustrating because you i knew that the fruit of my efforts were just going to line people's trash cans so that was a little disappointing and i also i mean i had so much background from high school and college um oh one thing i forgot to mention was that um during the summers in high school um one of the computer teachers just loaned me the keys to their new $3 million mini mini mainframe and so every day i would walk three miles through the summer this like i'm not even in school anymore i'd walk three miles over to our um vocational center and i would have this mainframe all to myself with the manuals and i mean i just i dug in deep i i could operate the thing i could anything of the systems administration of that mainframe i knew how to do and so that came in handy for jobs when i was in college too but then when i got this first job for some reason because i had a college degree they placed me as a um i'm spacing out now what it's called um so i wasn't a programmer it was um hopefully you can edit this out when i have brain farts like this um my gosh i can't even think of what the heck my title was how embarrassing but it wasn't programmer it was something related to it doesn't matter why am i spacing on that that's like really annoying yeah um but it's an insignificant detail it's a title right you know you had a yeah yeah well well okay so let me just say because my role wasn't one of a programmer that when i had to interface with the programmers i wrote i wrote like the specs for the programs and then we would have a programmer that would do the coding and the coding that they worked in was a a very simplistic computer language that they created for themselves was super limited but it would just do what they needed to do for the direct mail marketing but our our coders really thought they were the [ __ ] i mean it's like we're programmers and you just oh i was an analyst that's a systems analyst that's what they call it and you're just a systems analyst so you know you don't know how to do this stuff and i'm thinking oh my gosh this is child's play what you guys are doing it just was so frustrating that i got treated like an idiot but i had way more of a background so eventually i had to i had to prove that the hard way just by um working with different people that were well how do i explain this there were these two guys steve and greg i'm really going off in the weeds on this but these guys were the gurus of our computer system of our mainframe at that company and and they knew it and they were really hardcore and they were rude as heck to everybody else because everybody was so ignorant in their eyes right there's these little peon programmers and they would always come to them with their major problems and they would just be annoyed to no end and one day my team had a problem and so i had to come along with the programmers to go see stephen greg kind of like the wizards of oz right you know these were the big guys behind the curtains and uh i remember these these guys were just like so dismissive they wouldn't even look up at us and one of them made some kind of reference to um happy days right that was a big show at the time well i think it was probably over at the time but still in syndication at least and uh and so i just on intuition just threw out a line from happy days and uh i remember steve looking up from his desk at me like and he says a monkey speaks you know like what and so uh and then he went back to what he was doing and then he would do something else and i just things that i could identify with and so i would just toss out a comment and he would stop what he was doing and look at me and now my the programmers and my boss behind me were getting nervous because they're like shut up you're annoying him but little did they know he was like wait a minute what what's up with this guy and so i i caught his attention we started talking later and then he realized that i i knew c and c++ which he did not know and he really wanted to know he knew that i knew like these you know desktop computers which was a whole new thing for him and he was fascinated by anyway we just we hit it off and uh that was really all i needed to get in um and then i was starting i was able to write bigger programs and get into more and more stuff there so um yeah i don't really know where i was going with that story but just it just kind of cracks me up yeah no that's great so then going from there and with the coding with the that was the mail company right so yeah what was the next step and what was the plan like i mean it sounds like you just followed the path of well this is what i enjoy doing i'm just gna uh you know get a degree in what what i enjoy and then i'm gonna get a job doing kind of you know some of the coding stuff and what i enjoy but then was there a plan behind it or it's just you know ride the wave and see where you know coding and programming and takes me yeah i mean i was just kind of riding the the way of really i knew you know from high school that i wanted to get into computers because it would be something that would pay well and would be really interesting um but then i i sort of found my niche at that company once once i was accepted and allowed to do things um i started automating our systems so i developed this program that ended up doing what we had a whole team of of ladies that would they were in charge of the batch operation one of our biggest uh database fulfillment systems and i mean i realized that all the stuff that they were doing at the keyboard was just a very repetitive tasks and i knew how to use uh higher level language application programming interface to simulate what they were doing using their logic and just completely automate that whole thing and i i talked to my boss about it because i i had the idea for it but i was really concerned that i might put these folks out of work and he's like no no don't worry about that we can find plenty of other things for them to do so if you think you can do that go for it and so i did and so um going back to steve and greg they were really big into the old sitcoms there was a old tv show called that girl starring marlo thomas before my time yeah well it kind of before mine too i just i vaguely remembered it but but they knew it really well and apparently the star of the show marlo thomas her name was an anarie she uh she had a boyfriend by the name of donald h excuse me there because my voice can donald hollinger and so she wouldn't refer to him as her boyfriend she would refer to him as her current date so whenever you're coding things often you needed the the date in your program and so they would always say hey what's the current date and somebody would say donald hollinger as a joke rather than saying the date anyway they decided to give me a i had to create a artificial login for this entity that i was creating and so they gave it the name of donald hollinger and so this thing became quite big it ended up doing all kinds of automation for the company and uh as a result what used to take a week for this batch processing was brought down to a single day and then there were other systems that i set up the first bulletin board system if you can remember those things you used to be able to dial up into and be able to you know post things and get into forums and such i used that technology to be able to take our data fulfillment which used to come out on magnetic tape and then get fedexed to the customer who bought the list of of mailing addresses and things from us um instead of having to ship that magnetic tape which took lots of time i implemented this bulletin board system and now you know they could get it immediately all they had to do is just dial in as soon as the batch was finished and and download it uh and then there was just lots of other automations that built upon on top of that so just i kept getting this process down from a week to like a day to four hours to about an hour and a half and so i made a good name for myself anyway through that so efficiency that's the you know name of the game right and so so i guess you stayed at that company for a long time about 10 years yeah all right and then throughout that process still health and fitness was a major focus or how did that go it wasn't no no i wouldn't call it a major focus it was just it was something i was interested in it was something i did again i didn't really know what i was doing i mean i thought i did i would go to gnc and i would walk the aisles and go oh yeah that looks like an interesting supplement i think i'll take that one you know so i bought lots of supplements and i just had no clue if they were doing anything anything for me or if i needed them or even if they were harming me i didn't know so yeah so when when did when did the the health mindset get to the point where it's like i'm g to start tracking i'm going to start trying to optimize you know all the as many biomarkers as possible when did that come into play as a major focus so through the course of working in that job and doing the automation that i was doing i had to get a lot of data out of things um at one point i was responsible for doing both well was performance tuning for an operating system a database and applications so i had to get lots of data out of each of those environments put them into excel graph them out and then as we tweaked various you know um like buffers and you know other little nerd knobs of these environments uh to see how those had an effect upon the processing was it getting better was it getting worse so um well i guess they would have called now they would probably call that [ __ ] around and find out but that's yeah gotta put that on a t-shirt but yeah right um but i mean that's really the only thing you could do back then to be able to reverse engineer a program just or to like do performance tunings you had to play around with the variables and and see what would result kind of like figuring out what's inside of a black box that's that was your only option i started realizing through this that um you know our bodies are very much a very complex system and it frustrated me that we didn't have any users manual for it and that i didn't really have any good data on what my buffers were or my inputs and outputs which is one of the things i love about your channel because you were so excellent at controlling all of your inputs and being able to figure out what your results yeah i i try to it's not a perfect system you know sometimes things get in the way but which is annoying you know but uh i want to digress just slightly just to say just to praise you because i watch a lot of youtube videos and i listen to a lot of podcasts but when yours come on i stop everything that i'm doing and glued that screen and i'm doing screenshots of all your different slides and stuff and fascinating the thing is your coding experience your coding experience you could probably do what i do infinitely better i'm i'm like you know it's funny the coding guy greg and steve and he's like the monkey speaks i feel like a monkey playing with stats it's just simple correlations you know i get sometimes i get criticized by like hardcore uh machine learning types and basian i don't have i don't i don't know what where even i don't have that coding experience they're like you should do it like this and i'm like i get what you're saying but this simple approach most of my biomarkers are better than where they were right so there's probably a higher level to analyze the data but you know you can get you can go far on just simple correlations and you know but i try it's an imperfect system i for me it's like i don't want any praise you know i'm 70 plus years away from that that's that's the way i see it if i can really do what i think i can do and my genetics don't get in the way then maybe i was on to something but maybe i just squeeze the orange of you know so my dad's brother died at 51 he had a stroke 48 and then that's it three years later so i don't know that i i don't have those genetics and i'm just milking as much of the orange as i can maybe that's 75 i don't know i hope not but you know all we can do is maximize you know based on our genetics right so yeah well if you're ever looking for beta testers or things that you're doing uh sign me up yeah that's i appreciate that so we're building an app and as i'm as we're talking i'm like [ __ ] you could probably build an even better app that's the thing so um limited in the environments that i i know how to code in and coding on phones that's very foreign to me i've tried it's the development environment is just it's huge it's it's like learning a whole new world for me yeah i feel a little left out of that but you know for now i mean right for now yeah now that i'm retired i might actually have some time to dedicate to that so we see but most of my automation i' like to use in excel because it's it's powerful i can crunch a lot of data and then get good results so i can visually figure out what's what's what from that so yeah same i mean same but i'm primitive compared you know you've got actual coding skills you know so when i uh sat down to try to learn to code a few years ago i just i don't have the i've said this before in other places but i don't have the brain i just don't i can't like i watch all the videos and i practice it and then it doesn't go exactly how they said then i get frustrated i'm like i'm literally like the monkey pounding on the table like why doesn't this work so i can only focus on what i'm good at right so well if you're ever looking for excel macros for something to make something throw something over the wall at me and say here can you do this and set it up for me and i'll send it to you cool thanks dave all right so wait so when did when did that kick in so like at what age did did the bulb go off because for me i had a light bulb moment but for you when was there an age that you were just like human body is the same way i i can start maybe i can start to optimize my health if i can you know play with the inputs and you know and outputs well that was the frustrating part because i came upon that way too early i i tried to get you know data from my doctor no way no way and they didn't have anything that you could buy online like they do now so um yeah i would go see my doctor and i'd want to know like i'd ask him what's i want to know what like my testosterone is my my estrogen my estradi and he just starts laughing he's like wait a minute estrogen estral you don't have those you're a man just thought i was a complete idiot right yeah you don't you don't need those and i'm like thinking wow even i know more than this guy this is kind of scary um yeah so and then when he would run something he would run like just a single marker that didn't tell you you know what's going on in reference to other things so totally useless data completely useless so it wasn't probably for maybe another decade before these individual self-help kind of tests became available and then i really had stuff something i could work with so it was always interested when you'd go for like a yearly physical it's just the tech and the doctors at the time i mean i i don't know if i've ever mentioned this publicly but like in in texas so i moved here from texas and uh i was testing you know basically begging my doctor at the time to measure like four times a year just the cbc keno whatever the standards yeah and uh so when i moved here i wanted to do the same thing and and like you said it was before the age i mean granted like 15 years ago of order everything online go to the lab like that didn't exist so um one of the doctors here um wrote in my file like uh suffers from anxiety didn't tell me to my face just wrote that down and then because you asked for data because i asked for data and i wanted to be proactive and get ahead of the game and uh and i was even like look you know i'm not trying to you know flex not trying to do any of that but i i was like i'm a scientist over here you know like and they probably hear so many delusional people she probably put me in that bin you know so anyway like i i she left the new doctor came and then he asked me he was like how's your anxiety going he like wait what i don't i don't generally suffer from anxiety i mean occasionally something at work will stress me out but i don't have an anxiety disorder where it's chronic and i'm like so anyway just that mindset of if you want to try to optimize your health by measuring more often than once a year or whatever you must suffer from some personality disorder or anxiety disorder it's just crazy to me so yeah i guess and i guess if you had something they couldn't diagnose they would just say it was all in your head too so that's terrible right yeah yeah a lot of gaslighting of people so for you it kicked in about 15 years ago or when would you say that no that would have been in my 30s so that would have been yeah so they weren't giving forgetting how old i actually am so that would have been more than 30 years ago it doesn't seem that old though i mean it just seems like a time a number i i don't know it's crazy it does i look at myself like i'm still 20 so i it blows my mind when i'm with actual 20 and 30 year olds because i'm like wait a minute you've you don't know these bands you don't know this tv show that i'm referring to doesn't compute yeah my 15-year-old would like uh pull up a tik tok on some like 3 second hook on a song and i'm like you don't even realize the original was whatever and then yeah uh so so were they you were trying to get blood test data from your doctor and then they just weren't giving it to you you up to you know 30 years ago um but then was there ever a time when you would get that get that your blood test data from the doctor and then you started recording it yeah yeah i lost a lot of that unfortunately i know i in my spreadsheet i started including um the earliest i could go back and find but you know most of the stuff they give you was hard copy there was no email versions of things that you could take that data out of anything other than having to type it back in yourself so it was very frustrating yeah so so what would you say 15 years like what was the i don't remember the earliest data that you had um yeah i don't either um i'm thinking probably around 2012 is when i really started my deep dive so i would have been just turning 50 and i know i've told this story in a couple other podcasts but you know maybe somebody new will be hearing this um i was just starting my first marathon and i i'd heard on a podcast something about telr and i didn't know what they were but i was fascinated and apparently they get shorter as you get older so i thought huh there's a test for that i think i'd like to take that test because i'm certain it's going to come back and tell me i have the t mires of a 20-year-old right because i felt i felt pretty good i felt way better at 50 than i did at 30 um and a lot of that had to do with me finding p90x at probably about age 45 i i'm skeptic about everything so when i saw the infomercials for p90x i'm thinking well that's complete [ __ ] you know that's just dumb but then as i the more i watched it i thought well wait a minute they've actually got some really wellth thought out routines and plans anytime i'd ever seen anybody in the gym they didn't really have a system they didn't really know what they were doing they're just slinging some weights around and hoping for the best whereas i being the geek that i am would go to the gym and with my clipboard board and i would go on like all the nautilus equipment you know the machines and stuff and i would write down my weight the number of reps and i would chart it out it would didn't even have excel back then it was some other program i can't think of the name of it was the precursor to excel but i would graph this stuff out and do little charts to see if i was improving sufficiently you know anyway um so when i saw p9x i thought all right yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna give that a shot just to prove that it doesn't work so i did everything that they specified right to the letter and i was kind of amazed because like 30 days in i'm i'm starting to see some chest developing i'm seeing my biceps and triceps were looking great again i mean high school i was huge but after high school getting into college and getting busy with work you know i let all that go i didn't have that spare time just to hang out in the backyard and sling sling weights around so i lost a lot of that but i started seeing some real good definition the tone and starting to get cut and other people started to notice too so that was a really nice thing and i was hey okay i'm going to keep doing this 30 days 60 days 90 days my confidence completely changed i would go out to the bar with friends that were you know fairly good-look guys that used to get all the attention and one of my best friends at the time slightly arrogant um used to think all the girls were looking at him which they probably were to his to his defense me i remember there was a girl on the dance floor that was like looking at the both of us and he assumed it was him so he started to go out to do the little white boy shuffle and get in there and dance with her and she's like totally rebuffed him and he's like what's going on with this so he comes back stands next to me again and and she's smiling and looking at us and he's like he's still can't comprehend that she was looking at me not him and i couldn't comprehend it either because i'm thinking i'm noticeable now i was used to being completely invisible yeah again from childhood on through you know most of my upbringing through high school more of a wall flower i guess than anything else yeah anyway so p90x completely changed my life so again now so i'm at 50 i'm i'm looking good i'm feeling good better than i had in my whole life i do this telr test comes back and tells me i have the telr of a 68-year-old and i was aged 50 so now i'm shocked thinking what am i wait what am i missing i i think that i'm doing all the right things at least by what we know right now to be the right things taking all the right supplements doing the right exercises i was i was tracking my sleep dave aspey loves to talk about this old sleep tracker that he used to wear that attached on a headband it was called the zo the zo sleep band i had one of those so i was always recording my data off that loved that thing it was brilliant because it was really just picking up the waves directly from your brain rather than you know off of a ring or a wristband and and trying to figure out by an algorithm what what you know are you in r are you in deep sleep i still don't know how they figure that out from this stuff but anyway um i've digressed in so many different directions here but um i thought i was doing everything right so then i rudely had to dig in and find out what is it i seem to be healthy i seem to have fitness but there's this whole longevity piece that apparently i'm not doing very well at so how does that fit in what is it what do i need to do so i started doing dr google to find everything i could about telam and what there might be to make them longer there really wasn't a lot known about it at that time i think it was a couple years years later they started learning about taras by studies of cancer cells and how they tend to produce their own and they can seem to be immoral and then a few years after that they developed the first talam rice activators i think it was tam 818 the bill andrews product and that was ridiculously expensive still is so i didn't jump on it right away because there was a no way i could afford that but um over time i i kept thinking well i'm gonna have to bite the bullet if i really if i really think this is going to do the trick and living a a good long life is important to me then i'm gonna have to spend the money and see what happens see if it works so i did and i would retest every year to that that same company until they went defunct and i started seeing my my telr you know getting longer and longer which was wonderful well you've probably seen from some of my data i recently shortened them again but there are two different measures one is so true diagnostics is the epigenetic estimation even though that may be a better measure that's very debatable not much not much data um but so wait so that gets to the idea of you know kind of a so i think you you improved the ar length in part from the toras activator but then also um i think you you mentioned like you change your diet that was the impetus to change your diet you just started eating more clean and or before that before that ended up doing a consultation with this company because they offered that as part of the you know your test results and i started explaining to them well they asked me to explain my lifestyle and you know i'm i thought well i knew lifestyle had something to do with it i just didn't realize how much it did so i started explaining that you know i i do p90x i'm training for my first marathon i uh have a very very stressful job it goes from like zero to 60 and and nothing flat and i'm also taking care of my two elderly parents who are battling cancer at the same time and uh as i'm explaining this the guy's like whoa wait stop stop um we've seen this before we we've seen it in people who have really like they're type a people have really stressful jobs the stress shortens your telr we've seen it in in endurance athletes who put on high miles and just you know are abusing themselves basically you know through the stress that they're putting in their bodies um and you're doing p90x on top of that which you know is another you're really really doing yourself some damage there and we've seen it in caretakers you know people that are dealing with parents and having to change diapers and all the stress that comes with that you've got the trifecta going on so it's no wonder that your telemeters are so short and so they recommend that i start trying to find ways to mitigate my stress levels and they recommended things like yoga and meditation and i started laughing because those are things i really used to do i used to do those in my early 20s like from teens to 20s and even through college um yeah all through college and i just forgot about because once i got working in my day job i you know things get lost when real life kicks in they sort of fall on the floor so i had to pick those back up again and really start focusing on my recovery more recovery than just hard charging forward forward forward which i'm having to relearn again now for the same reason because i've been putting a lot of stress on myself and i think that's had a a shortening effect on my telr in fact i know it has um yeah so so then that gets to the idea of exercise prescription right because right i and i know mentioned this a billion times but you know exercise is well known to increase average but you know by an you know life expectancy increase of up to about 8 years um but you know that gets that gets us to like 80ish uh so you know when you consider that only you know it's like calorie restriction at least in rats if you calorie restrict them it increases their so if you exercise train rats no cr increases average lifespan just like in people but if you calorie restrict them no exercise they live even longer both average and maximal so and when you calorie restrict and exercise train there's no synergistic effect so it gets to you know there's something about exercise that's great for health span and and uh you know living a little bit longer but then it's probably chronic stress which goes to exercise prescription what is the optimal exercise dose that can get us even longer a longer health span not just that eight-year average life expectancy increase so so how do you um how do you how do you balance that because for me it's like heart rate variability resting heart rate are great are great insight into stress right so you could have super recovered data heart rate variability resting heart rate and minimize stress completely but then what's your v2 max what's your muscle strength so how do you see the balance or how do you now evaluate the balance between how often you exercise for how long at what intensity versus these measures of stress whether it's tm length or hrv resting part rate how do you integrate that yeah now um now when i'm doing training for a marathon or half marathon i should just say half marathon because i'm not doing any fulls anymore that's way too much um if i'm still doing p90x at all during that then i'm i'm doing the run training where a cardio day would have been in p90x so it's it's more of a cross training and i'm making them more synergistic rather than trying to cram them both in at the same time i found that the importance is being able to come down from the stress the stress is a good thing but then don't just replace it with another stress and keep going throughout the day yep you've got to it's how quickly you can come back down from the stress you just put yourself under and that seems to be the magic sauce for me if if i go out and do a run you know come back in and uh you know get my mind on some happy things and i'm not just trying to charge through the rest of my day or go do a bunch of yard work on top of that which again i had to relearn because i just did that a lot lately um so so then so it's almost like uh titrating downward if you have a high activity high stret because exercise is stressor i mean no exercise no stressor but it's hormetic right so as you know so i guess if you have a high activity high stress day then you try to titrate it downward for a couple days until you're more fully recovered whether it's general feel or is that how you're even more immediate so if i go out and i do a run i like to follow that up with a sauna right afterwards because sauna is pretty synergistic with exercise you know it helps to you know keep the growth hormone high but in the sauna i'm i'm either like meditating or i'm watching a netflix that just completely takes me out of my head and entertains me and so i can just feel myself relaxing and coming down from that and then a nice long shower and then maybe do some recovery like i have normat tech compression boots i'll i'll put those on i have an amp coil that i'll set on my chest at the same time and now i've even got a brain tap that i'll put on so i'll be doing the brain work and stacking all three of those together and i just bliss out in that too so see this is why you're underrated people don't know they just think oh he you know the dude is ripped 62 he's ripped he's got a epigenetics pace of aging that's as good as the best some of the best and then you start talking about all those things things people don't know like that you're underrated i'm not doing that stuff i haven't evolved to that to that level so um so wait so if have you looked at so some people have the physiology where they'll chronically adapt higher higher training volume hrv resting heart rate will continue to improve right i mean granted maybe there's an upper limit but it's dramatically a higher volume upper limit compared to somebody else right so especially elite some elite athletes i've seen some endurance athletes that have really bad hrv resting heart rate but can bike for you know 40 miles or whatever they you know you doing triathlons and all that too so do you have the physiology where your body will always adapt to well granted distress tiir shortening being one example but at at least for me i can't if i'm if i do a 90-minute workout p9x is what 45 minutes or so it depends on the workout in the day it can be longer it can be like an hour and a half yeah so hour and a half workout if i'm not like totally relaxed i mean just like maybe some walking if i'm doing yoga anything even yard work that's going to slow my recovery for for the next workout unfortunately i don't have the physiology that for whatever reason i don't know if i can biohack around that and figure out that recipe why my recovery would be so much slower but you it seems like you're able to grind not grind necessarily but how many how many p90x workouts per week um well how many should i do versus how many do i actually do no no no how many are you actually doing okay um at least three solid workouts a week and that cumulatively is how many minutes would you say oh so i mean each one of those would be about an hour and a half yeah so you already you've got more in the high you know high volume high training and that's not including yard work yoga yoga you know uh everything else all all the other activities carol bike the carol bike my gosh so yeah the carol bike's relatively new for me i just got that last november so it's not not been a whole year yet and i gotta say i don't want to make this a carol bike commercial because i am an affiliate i gotta be honest with you on that but i i was shocked by the carol bike when i when i saw it at the biohacking conference several years ago i'm thinking h nice gimmick you know how can that really do anything but then i would hear more and more of my favorite podcasters really talking about the benefits that they saw from it and i'm thinking all right hopefully these guys aren't just trying to market to me you know i'm hoping that they're really being honest about their experiences with this so if there's so many of them that are agreeing about what they're getting from this and yeah maybe i should really give this a serious try and so i i bought one and i'd been using it pretty consistently but the thing about the carol bike is i never felt like i was getting any better at it you know i' kind of beat myself up i'm like oh my gosh i really suck i would look at my leaderboard score is on it you know and i'm maybe the middle of the pack on the leaderboard i'm thinking gosh i thought it was in good shape why why am i so bad compared to this whole top half of this group and i'm i'm imagining the bottom half are like 80 and 90 year olds on this which may or may not be true but that's you know kind of beating myself up mentally about it so i just i would keep add it anyway but i didn't really think i was getting any benefits only because it's ai driven so every time you perform well you know the next time you do it it increases that resistance just a little bit more and it just keeps giving you a little bit harder each time and so i feel like i'm doing exactly the same thing always but i'm not i'm actually improving you know as time goes but it's so gradual that i didn't notice and the way i saw it shocked me i every year i do the american lung association's fight for air climb and that involves well at least here in detroit it involves running coera park the stadium all around the stadium so you're running up and down all the bleachers all the way around the park and every year i would train for that just because it's you know it's it's a hard event for me anyway a lot of stair workor it's a lot of huffing and puffing but this year i didn't get to it i was you know in italy for 30 days um immediately coming back from that i started working in my attic which is the worst time of year to be changing out old instulation and putting in new but i did and i was pushing really hard up there right up until the day of the the event and i thought well this is going to suck because i didn't prepare for this but when the day came and i i did the event i had fun i felt good and i didn't think a whole lot about it until i looked at my scores and my times you know afterwards and realized that i just did that whole thing faster than any year prior like by a pretty good margin and i was a minute shy of placing first in my age group which if iid had any clue i would have pressed i mean i really would have tried because if first had been in my reach i would have went for it so i was shocked i didn't know why i didn't know what i could attribute that to the carol bike was not really in the back of my mind at that point because i didn't think the carol bike was doing anything and then later i was training for mount k and and which is an event i didn't didn't get to do because of the crowd strike thing but i did a lot of training for that and i had to jump into the middle of the training program again because i was in italy i was working in the attic i wasn't doing the training at the beginning of the training program so i didn't gradually build up from you know 30 minutes of running to a mile of running to three miles of running i jumped into our training program right when we did our first six mile so i went out and did my first six mile run and again looking at my results of that six miles untrained this year was faster than my six miles at the end of the training season last year fully trained and i'm like wait what what and then at that point i realized it's got to be the carol bike because that's the only real training if you want to call it that that i've been doing and just shocked at how much that's improved my whole cardiovascular system so i'm sold i don't mind doing little commercials like that for carol bike because i'm impressed and it's not often i'm impressed with stuff like that i know it sounds like a commercial but apologies it's a part of your approach so i'm curious about these things and i have no affiliation to car carot bike so i just want to know more but um so what it's just a standard like um uh stationary bike but then it's you you program it with i mean i get are you wearing a heart rate monitor is it yes and heart rate heart rate strap and then it's it's got a um well it's like a tablet that's attached to the front of it you could use it for pelaton i think if you wanted to there's lots of there's fat burner things that you can do but i've been using the um 222nd allout sprints that's that's their hardest you know the beyond their intermediate uh training program and so that's the one i've been using and seeing great results with and then so the carob bike so you'll program it to to a certain time a certain heart rate zone how how yeah there's there's no no there's no programming i just choose this fixed 22 second allout sprints and so you got you get in you start pedaling for i think maybe it's two minutes to begin with and it's um there's like a breath pacer that you see on the screen so they're they're showing you your your heart rate they're showing you your cadence and then they're also showing you your um because it would be your power output and so you're supposed to be keeping your power output like under 20 watts and um you're just following this breath pacer so you're having you breathe in and then breathe out and then right about the time the clock counts down to like three seconds then the screen turns red and you're like imagining the tiger that's chasing you now you just start pedling as fast as you can and you've got 20 seconds to do that for which i mean 20 seconds doesn't sound like long until you're doing that all out yeah and by 15 seconds you're like this is this ever going to end i'm dying here and so and but it's and it gets progressively harder and harder and harder until the very end you're just you could barely move these pedals and then you've got another two minutes of a breath pacer and to bring your heart rate back down before the next one so 20 seconds all out and then you said two minutes of minutes in between of of like just recovery rest and then how many cycles how many cycles of that two oh just two so it's i mean it's a five minute workout uh it works out to be 10 so there's two in the beginning two in the middle and two in the end cool down two four six and then okay well it's it's less than 10 minutes let's put it that way but i know it's more than five but short short and intense i mean that's that's the thing it's not an hour of you know ass kicking you know all right so how do you how do you set up your workouts for the week i mean it ss like you're doing a variety of you know the yoga and the yard work and the car bike and the p90x i mean do you have a set schedule we like on this day i'm going to do like how do you make those decisions and and then also do you pay any attention to heart rate variability wrestling heart rate in guiding your training so i should i should but honestly i haven't been and i think that's probably a flaw because i'm not making use of that data i mean so if you don't subjectively feel bad and you're you know so i think it would be bad if you're like mentally ground down and then you force your yourself through a workout probably if you're mentally ground down probably the metrics of stress are going to be really bad so i think pushing through that would be bad but if you feel okay and but what i find really weird is that when i'm tired and i have a run that's scheduled for that day according to the training program i'm thinking the last thing i want to do is go for a run right now that's usually the best runs i have i can't explain it there's times when i feel great and i think i'm going to go out and crush that run and i suck so the whole mental mindset of like how do i feel that day is completely reversed for me i don't know if it's that way with everybody else so that's why i've learned not to pay attention to how do i feel that day because yeah that usually is it lies to me yeah and the proof is in the pudding because like you said your you know what was it the your uh time this year for the was it the mile time or the half marathon time was better this year and you weren't even trying six mile run yeah yeah so i mean if it was something where you're grinding through it and grinding the gears i'd imagine you'd see that it's perpetually getting worse over time but that's the overtraining effect but you don't see that so you you got probably have long uh not uh uh athlete athlete genetics i mean you know well you know it's funny you say that because my grandfather my my dad's father used to be an incredibly athletic guy from what i've heard when i when i knew him he was just this really hunched over old man with his big pop bottle of glasses and a smoking a pipe and never got out of his chair so that's the grandfather i knew but back in his heyday he had trophies for softball he had trophies for bowling he was good at anything that he tried he used to go into bars and he would bet people that he could take a broomstick and hold it in both hands and jump through it and then jump through it back the opposite way without letting go he could do it he' bet people that he could go down with one arm like do a one arm push-up to the floor and pick up a match stick with his lips and then come back up again right and so that he was a heavy heavy drinker so he would make these bets for people to buy him booze and he would always win it's almost like the the super par it's like unbreakable you know uh wasn't he doing some of that did you see that movie unbreakable yeah i did yeah i think any he was yeah yeah yeah the funny thing though about all that is my grandfather being a mean drunk was i guess he was rotten to my dad when it came to like throwing a ball around because he wouldn't just underhand soft pitch a ball to my dad when he was little he would fast ball it and bean my dad like hit my dad with the ball and so my dad like wanted nothing to do with sports at all just completely opposed to them so when i grew up my dad wasn't into sports he didn't want us to have anything to do with sports he didn't teach us to do anything with sports so i mean i never learned how to play baseball basketball um barely could play catch i started throwing around a football with friends at recess and so that's where i got you know started doing it with both arms you know i got pretty good throwing it with either hand so first we threw like we threw like girls doing it with their opposite hand which i shouldn't say because there's a lot of girls that can throw football way better than me right now but back then that was the term right you're throwing like a girl um yeah but pretty soon after practicing that enough i got just as good with either hand so yeah i always wanted to get into sports but my parents wouldn't let me i even wanted to do track because i had friends that were in track in high school but my parents said no if you've got time for an extracurricular activity like that then you have time to get a job to save money for college so wasn't able to i mean so the the one sport i think that you didn't mention i think health and fitness i see that as a sport or sports athletic activity right so i mean you could make theart and i'm a big sports fan baseball basketball mma i appreciate all of it right so um you could make the argument that the most important sport is taking care of your health and your fitness and being active but so that brings up the question like do you have any uh ideas or plans for competing in masters competitions whether it's uh half marathons or squat bench press deadlift i mean no no because i'm not good at any of those i i disagree i think i think uh well granted i mean you're not specifically training right you're training more of the general fitness circuit training kind of with the p90x is more circuit training right the whole time you're moving and yeah yeah there's weight bearing days and then the cardio days would be like extreme yoga plot got platies um like there's kempo x so it's like kempo karate there's plyometrics or jump training i mean they've got some really great cross training so you're always working different muscle groups i always tell people that have tried it they say oh yeah i tried that i couldn't do that that was way too extreme i always tell them look if you can get past the first two weeks of that yeah you're gonna be sore everywhere because you're going to feel muscles you never knew you had but after those first two weeks are over your body starts to acclimate to it and it gets easier it gets better yeah and then you start seeing the gains but it's hard to stick through that first two weeks and i get why people drop out but so the p90x is is videotapes i mean you're just or i don't know vide tapes listen to me i mean it's like we're you know there are no videoes anymore dvds dvds yeah yeah yeah so you asked me how do i know which workout to do on which days yep the cool thing is you know p9x came with a 14-day plan so there is a different dvd for each day of 14 days so and that repeats so never really get tired of doing the same thing over and over again and your muscles don't um you know you get the m you keep the muscle confusion going because you're always doing something different and so i i have that schedule and i being the coder that i am i have this big excel i can't even call it a spreadsheet it's an it's a full-blown application that i wrote in excel that will give me my schedule for the day like the workout that i'm doing for the day and i have all the dvd is burned onto the hard drive of this particular laptop and i've got it all backed up somewhere too in case the laptop crashes but um so the schedule i i get up in the morning i go down in the basement the laptop's already open and on the screen it shows me the workout that i'm scheduled to do for that day so i don't even have to think about which one i'm going to do it's just the next one that's on the list and then i you know push the button and it'll play on my tv that that work out for me which i don't always need to play because i pretty much have it memorized now so um but there are things that you know that might be timed like there's slow slow motion three in one push-ups where you'll do you know for the count of four you'll be pushing up and then count of four you'll be pushing down you'll do that for a certain number of them you'll do them wide to start with and you'll do them narrow and then you'll do them military style and that i like to do with the video because it helps pace me so i don't have to try to figure out how fast or how slow i need to go i can just go with the the group and the dvd so so that's every day it's a 14-day cycle basically there there are no rest days in p90x i mean or there are yeah it's like sundays are usually on the schedule as a rest day but their rest days are they're not really rest they're more of a recovery day so there would be a thing like yoga a certain type like a yoga would be that course synergistics i think is one of the recovery days so you're still actively doing stuff but it's very low impact and slow motion stuff but then you add in the carol bike and you know yard work so how do you is it it's just whenever you feel like how do you how do you integrate the other activities too into the into the approach or it's just i like doing it i'm gna do it today or i feel great today i'm or i don't feel great you know how how do you integrate there's there's days when i know that i've got hard yard work coming up that i'll i'll skip workout but then there's other days where i'm too bullheaded and i think i can do both you know i'll do the workout first and then i'll push through the day of of doing the yard work and by the end of the day i'm i'm wiped totally wiped which feels great and i sleep pretty good after that as long as i don't up to a point i mean there's still some of those days when i was doing the um the workouts and then going up in the attic and working on that or again you know going out and trimming the bushes and you know cutting the grass there are times that i would get in bed and then i couldn't sleep because my mind is still racing i'm still like super tense you know so there is that happy sweet spot there i don't i'm not always good at finding it because i just i'm one of those hard chargers i guess i just push too much yeah so what time of the day is it first thing in the morning is it early afternoon when when is the best time for you so when i was working i am retired now as of last september so it's almost a year now when i was working it was super easy to know when to do it because i only had certain number of minutes that were spare or available during the day so i had to get it in in the morning first thing or um i might be able to go do it in exercise snacks so i'll i'd start it first thing in the morning i'd get maybe partway through come take a conference call soon as the conference call ended run back downstairs do a few more things things come back do another call or you know do some some work and i was just finishing off the rest of it in pieces and peace meal throughout the rest of the day now that i've been retired i don't have that that discipline that forced discipline so i'm finding it really difficult to stick to the same routines because now i can do something else i can go look at personal email i can do an interview with somebody um you know go run and do a blood test so you know now i don't have to like fasting blood tests i can i could do at 11 o'clock if i want to i don't have to do it super early in the morning so that tends to mess up my schedule a little bit just because i can so it it sounds like it's more a matter of getting in the work not necessarily what time a day it's just you're trying to get it in now granted with the discipline versus you know when you're not retired but yeah but you still try to get it in every day and follow the the itinerary it's not a set time right yeah interesting so that that so what about sleep timing are you aiming for the same time time and day or is that just you know i'm i'm laughing because i've been kicking my own butt lately because my sleep timing has been terrible because i keep thinking i've been working harder and more now than when i did when i had a job which seems bizarre to say but it's because of these you know interviews and the prep ations and uh you know doing different affiliate type deals planning trips been going to lots of conferences i've got lots more testing planned in fact coming up here on like the 3 of september i don't know when this is going to air but i'm gonna be going out to la so i'm going for the radfest conference i'm excited for that when i go i'm going to um get a perovo full body scan or full body mri i'm going to joy kong's clinic for stem cell treatment and uh i'm scheduled to meet brian which will be interesting nice i'm gonna record it i'm sure he's gonna make a video yeah i don't i don't know how that's really gonna go i've got somebody coming with me that i'm gonna have you know using my camera in fact she's the one that set up the the meeting between brian and i because she works with brian um and so i'm g to ask her to maybe take a couple of pictures because i don't know how that's going to go yeah so are we going to see a a youtube channel a dave pasco youtube channel i don't know um to be honest with you that sounds like way more work than i really want to do because i keep picturing myself i'm retired now supposedly even though it feels like i'm transitioning into an entirely new career which i'm not opposed to it's just foreign to me so that's probably why it's been a little more stressful because it's out of my wheelhouse talking you know most people most of my friends could care less about any biohacking stuff so i never ever really get to speak to them about this stuff so just the fact that anyone out there is interested the fact that you want to record this and put it out on youtube just still blows my mind so i don't feel like i'm really accustomed to doing this yet i feel like i might be getting a little better with practice but so whether i want to do this or not and create a youtube it just sounds like way more work than i actually want to do i always saw my retirement as just sitting back goofing off with friends and having fun with life but now this is this is really feeling like work ah yeah so i i wouldn't want it to be work for you you know but for me for me it's fun i love making videos well that's awesome because we get the benefit from your fun i love that you have fun with it for me it would be work so i don't want to i don't want to never i don't want to say never right maybe i just don't think i'd have anything interesting to say ah so i think it's a matter of so i think the you're you're i keep saying it but you're like the uh developing superhero it's like who doesn't yet know that they're a superhero like for me you're a superhero in this space and it doesn't have to be conversations like i didn't start off like thinking i'm going to be interviewing or talking to anyone on the channel it's just me making videos in powerpoint you know so which i'm always going to do it's just my style but no um you made yourself a rock star in the process so well i mean i've got a long ways to go right i'm i think i'm one sickness away like you know my data is bad for a month we all are trust me we all are yeah but it could be something as simple as just uh you know people want to see more i think of you and and the lifestyle and you know i think it could be something as simple as you know i think you do garage workouts right you do the workouts in your garage in my basement in your basement okay so just setting up a camera you don't even have to talk or look at the camera people watching you work out which maybe seems weird but they're could be people who would benefit from seeing i mean your f62 you don't look you don't sound you're like you're living the lifestyle i thinking a lot of people could could uh learn from that i mean your website is great the d paso. Is great but um i don't know i think i think just setting up like a camera and just you just doing your thing and like sometimes maybe you'll be out of the shot so what but most of the time you're in the shot you just upload the video and and see i don't know just an idea but i think a lot of people benefit from you it's funny you say that because um there's another youtuber you might be familiar with her sierra clark yep she she did a 90day on brian's blueprint and and met with brian uh she and her crew were out here to visit me last weekend and so they filmed me going throughout the day through all my routines and uh one was we just a she and i did a little short just one little snippet of a p90x workout together which was kind of fun yeah so she where sierra has reached out to me too and uh yeah so we're scheduling to when she would come out here but i'm on a little small one-bedroom apartment with water stains behind my sink and my stove burner just melted somehow so uh and it's like a little apartment i try not to kick the walls when i'm doing like taekwon do kicks so that's gonna be interesting to to you know they'll have to do for you like they had to do for me because i'm in a little 900 foot house and uh they had to use a a wide wide l to be able to film stuff because my my sauna my carol bike it's all in my laundry room so there's really just enough room as a pathway to get between them to get to the washer and the dryer so they had to get in there and film like sit on top of the wash machine to be able to film us in the sauna you know so i'm sure they'll have to do the same for you yeah yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be interesting but so anyway i think i think you have a lot to offer it doesn't have to be with interviews doesn't have to be making powerpoint presentations or anything crazy and if it feels like work you shouldn't do it but anyway that's just i'm not try you know i i i try not to push people you know you know it's you're a grownup you can make your own decisions and do you know what i'm saying so but i think it would be great if you did and you know i thought it might be fun to maybe film that you know doing the perovo um you know going to do the stem cells like film some little segment and put it out there i just really haven't thought it through yeah yeah there's the whole production value of it all too yeah that see i i have no interest in for me the production value seems like work so it's like i don't want to sit there editing for hours and i don't want to send it somewhere and then it's back and forth you know i just want to create and put it out there so um i'm the same with instagram right i mean i've been putting some things out in instagram but that's way more work than i really wanted it to be too i mean i never i never desired to be an influencer right like h no but i've been getting into that been sucked into more and more of that which is another big time vampire for me because the more i'm on instagram you know finding and posting content and then you know exploring the content of other people is more time that i'm taking away from podcasts or taking away from going out and living my life and having fun right yeah it's all part of the game you know you kind of have to do it to get viewers and keep people interested and yeah so so uh so that's another thing i think you differ from most of the people in the longevity space is you're out there living life like you're not counting calories you're not you know calorie restricted you're not on an exercise prescription like me like you've got it's just you know it's not the f around find out it's just you're literally living life right so travels a big part of your approach and then you're not stressed about say say it seems to be now it it never used to be i was i was more like because i heard you on your interview um you were you were talking about how you're more of like it's a stay home kind of guy yeah i'm always been that way as well it's just that this year way more than ever i've been doing a ton of traveling like went to dallas for the biohacking conference i went to austin for a longevity conference um you know went to italy for the 30 days i was supposed to do kilamanjaro i'm going to be you know going to la here in another another week um and then i'm going to nicaragua for a mission trip you know in november and so wow it's like way way more traveling than i've ever been used to so and that also tends to add to the the stress because travel is rough to really seem at least for me it's pretty rough on my system so how do you get the workouts in during you know with the traveling how do you work around that it's a challenge i well i'll bring i'll bring my laptop with me and that's twofold one because you know i can edit my website and keep that up to date while i'm away but i also have the p90x workout videos on that so and my and my workout schedule so i can do a p90x workout in my hotel room if i need to do even with time change and being on a plane for six hours still doesn't matter it's yeah well i it's it's not pretty let's put it that way it's a grind it's more of a grind than usual it is so then diet too i think you try to eat it as clean as possible but then not counting calories don't have an eating window you're eating i guess what's like how do you how do you look at diet in this equation diet is huge in this equation i think you started to allude to it early on that or earlier that um with my true diagnostic data the only like real change i made between having a 0.77 i think it was to getting the 0.66 was finally cleaning up my diet so i i think the diet you know the the exercise and the sleep are all required i definitely had the exercise i think i was doing okay with the sleep but i was still doing a lot of processed foods and you know at the time my my while my parents were still alive it was very difficult to get them to eat cleaner now i was the one going and buying the food and i was buying it with my money so i was sort of a bully in that respect that i would make them eat healthier food whether they wanted to or not but it didn't come without a lot of push back because they loved their hot pockets which i still had to buy for them and uh their craft american fake cheese slices you know and things of that nature that they they wanted that i was embarrassed to even put in my shopping cart for fear that somebody would see me you know you eat that which is silly because i mean everybody else in the grocery store is buying the same things they could care less what i'm eating but my carts are almost always just fruit and vegetables loaded up from the produ style and then rarely anything else from the rest of the supermarket but when i finally started doing after the parents passed away and all the work that i did on this house was finished because that took a couple of years then i was finally able to start just making all of my own meals like i had always wanted to do rather than eating a pizza here or some taco bell there you know in between eating clean now i was eating 100% clean and that seemed to make all the difference in my true diagnostic pace of aging so even even on what you consider a un you know less clean versus clean diet at your worst it's a2 it's not 1.1 it's not 1.0 so the the true diagnostic the or not true dum pace it it's um it's an epigenetic prediction based on 19 biomarkers so one of those biomarkers is v2 max so basically you know they they had a cohort of people they had data for those 19 biomarkers v2 max some blood testing stuff waste the hip ratio a whole bunch of other stuff and then it's the epigenetic prediction of the people that had the most youthful clinical biomarkers versus the people who had you know intermediate and the worst so considering that exercise is a big foundation of your approach i' bet that you know v2 max your v2 max being relatively high probably skews you closer towards that 66 and then but and probably you're you know um you know your fitness level is still probably better than people my age or even younger like you train way more than most people so um which i don't see because when i'm running i've got old way older people just passing me all the time i'm one of those slow af runners you know i have i'm mostly in zone two i i saw a trainer when i went to do one of my dexa scans and had my vo2 max checked the trainer said you know you've got this whole another top range yeah you've never explored and i and i had to agree because i don't at that time that was prior to carol bike i i'd not done a whole lot of zone five training it was mostly always zone two and three and some four so i need to really focus on doing that more because i think i could pick up my speed a whole lot more and i'm starting to see that slowly i don't know that it's a running speed thing so and even i think the v2 max test where you have you know you have to physically breathe in the device and it's you're running up you know so it's a grad test so you're going up the hill you know at at a faster and faster pace every couple minutes i don't know that that may be granted it's the gold standard but all out sprints i can imagine that your lung capacity and your ability to process oxygen and your quotequote v of2 max um you don't have this external stimulus applied to your face you know it's kind of like white coat hypertension where people's blood pressure gets raised because they see the doctor in the white coat there may be something to you know would your v2 max be as high if you're not running it up a hill which i don't know most people really aren't training hills um versus the car bike is kicking your ass for 10 minutes that's an all out that's got to be a vo2 max booster which least for 40 seconds but for 10 minutes cumulatively you know it's still i granted it's it's up and down but um compared to someone doing you know whether it's slow runs or just less less exercise and they're less fit their v2 max won't be as high their doneen pace will be a little bit worse so i think that's the underlying thing you know with seams seams very very great score 6 whatever brian's point6 in that ballpark i think that's underlying factors having a relatively high because your worst data is pretty much my average data for denit and pace and yet all and all of my other bio market except but i i'm not i'm not trying to optimize v2 max at least right now pro for some of the reason you mentioned with you know when you're you have that n9 to5 and it's hard to train around that i'm kind of stuck in that for now so i'm limited on the exercise but um but yeah i think that's the underlying thing for deden pace which is the vo max but it's just funny how at your worst diet you've got data that's 10 years someone that's 10 years younger chronologically and that's really trying to push it even as young as he can and you're already it's like nothing for you it's easy so well you're gonna get there i i trust in that because you're gonna find it yeah i totally believe in that yeah it just may take having to train more and having the time and the freedom to do that but uh i wish v2 maxs go from 32 to 42 just through just through run training just getting out there and pushing at it so you could you're gonna be great you're gonna be way better than me so i don't doubt that at all so i've i i've come from like training like a gorilla and actually cutting down on the workouts because of the hrv and and wrestling heart rate data but it just comes down to like the other responsibilities of life and i only have like an exercise cost where if i go above that i don't recover as well so uh and then if don't recover as well then my actual 90-minute workouts start to suffer and i don't want to that's like the the core of what's keeping me fit and functional so um but at some point i expect to have more of that you know time to spend on exercise cost and hopefully sooner than later in the next year or so um to really supercharge it and kick it up and try to get to where you guys are with the0 66 i know you want to keep getting more and more lean right you want to you want to lose more weight or you good with your weight now so i had it down to it's on 57 140 41 pbs um last two days it's been on the even 139 so that's going in the wrong direction and i say that only because the hrv and resting heart rate for the longest time they've been improving with getting leaner without changing workouts and frequency intensity duration but then once i got below 140 um now they weren't they were they it's like that they hit a plateau and now that stress of too many calories was gone but now too few calories might be a stressor so i stopped and then you know for like the last three or four blood tests that basically uh keep it you know i'm trying to body weight maintenance uh until and then i also started to see some dip in the workout workout performance so you know everything i have is structured sets reps uh movements so i kind of have that p90x 14-day workout and the 90 minute workout every workout um so i know how many pull-ups i should be doing or or i do every workout there is no change it up for me i it just doesn't work so i for the longest time 12 to 13 pull-ups high quality pullups above the bar pronated and then two months ago it was 10 and then i was like what's going on here am i just being lazy am i getting bored is this aging if you're losing weight you're probably losing muscle right because already that's that could be true but uh during the 15 to 20 pound weight loss there was no uh still 12 to 13 pullups so and i've been body weight stable this whole year so that couldn't be a variable right so is it low nad so i increased nicotinic acid um anyway i've gotten that back but some of that equation may have been i was getting too lean and i was starting to lose a little bit of muscle so um yeah i've got to stay where i am now before i try to push it i don't want to get into the anorexic you know and then it's like function isn't good and freay i don't want any of that i want to be as lean and fit and functional as i possibly can you know so yeah i'm i'm down another 10 lbs from what i was like three weeks ago which is way way way way the wrong direction for me and according to my bathroom scale that was seven pounds of muscle that i lost and i can see it i can see it in my workouts because i i'm i'm not able to push the weights that i was doing just a month ago unintentional is that unintentional is because i was just pushing so hard through like doing all these schedules for these trips like for this whole la trip being able to schedule all those things at the same time was was pretty stressful for me i don't have people to do stuff like that for me um you know some some folks do i know you and i don't but and getting ready for sierra coming out and um just getting all the data to you and just everything was weighing on me and i wasn't settling down and then i would try to sleep and i'm i'm still all tense that could lead me to another story that i don't even know if i want to tell but uh yeah why not i'll tell it it's it's embarrassing i um i've been having this like bouts of diarrhea for like a couple of weeks and completely puzzled at what it was at first it happened right around when i started eating watermelon every day so i thought maybe maybe i got a tainted watermelon so threw the watermelon away when went a few more days still had it huh that's weird all right what else could it be what am i eating well my diet hasn't changed any that i know of um gosh you know maybe it's my water filters you know maybe i need to change out my water filters so so the aquat true and the refrigerator water filter i swapped those out it wasn't time it was way too early but i did it anyway just to be sure no so more days went by still still nothing but then you know a couple days i'd be fine and then right back into it again what the heck is causing this well then i thought all right i do sprouts maybe potentially something i got like an eoli or you know some kind of salmonella you know in the sprouts i'm always very very careful with my sprouting but uh so i threw my sprout out away bleached everything down again ran them through the dishwasher started all over again no still had the same problem then i started like it started to dawn on me like okay so there is a pattern to this weekends i don't seem to have the issue but week days i do what i did change my supplements a little recently because seam had done a review of my supplements right he rec recommended some better timing which i totally agreed with and then due to some studies there i was not taking the recommended study dose of glucosamine so i doubled my dose of that right and then my um my torine i i think i i'm trying to remember if that was i was not taking the right amount or i just didn't have the right amount on my website but either way i still increased that to um more optimal according to the study data of what you should take not thinking that you know my bowel tolerance may not be able to handle that along with everything else that i'm taking but more and more days went by of me trying to figure out what's causing this so there are some days where i just take the morning supplements and not the evening and i'd be fine and then i'd swap that and try taking the evening supplements not the morning nope it's the evening supplement so and then you know you got so many supplements you're taking you can't just figure out which one is which you can't pick it out right yeah so when i package up all my supplements i do it for a month so i've got four weeks of things packed up and now i'm three weeks into this new iteration with seams recommendations and i i think this i'm not i can't take this last week of supplements because i know it's going to give me diarrhea i had to throw it all away and start over again so that was a huge waste of money but at least i figured out what it was and i was able to you know knock my doses back down again still higher than what i was taking but not like doubling up on them and um that made a huge difference that helped a lot so i think that had a lot to do with uh the weight loss too in addition to the stress that i was putting myself under and it was wrecking my sleep because it would affect me mostly when i was trying to sleep and then having to just get up and run for the bathroom so all of it together was was terrible and i see that i it impacted me in my pace of aging my true diagnostic data so wait problem solved now or the diarrhea is still it should be problem solved yeah so that's a great story because i think you know figuring out issues and then i don't think it's intuitive for most people like it's just they go to the doctor the doctor put them on antibiotics maybe and then you know you haven't really fixed the problem and it was just a supplement in this case right so um yeah fantastic all right so made so many dumb mistakes with supplements through the years oh what other oh gosh wait so that brings me to also besides that the dumb dumb mistakes with supplements but so this was a recent weak spot a recent weak spot story right so do you have weak spots that you're trying to correct whether it's like flexibility whether it's uh i don't know herniated disc like do you have any oh yeah um so on my birthday in 2021 i've believe it was i got a concussion at a roller coaster park so as a celebration of my youthfulness i used to go to a roller coaster park every year on my birthday i mean it wasn't part of like any longevity plan it was just me celebrating how young i still feel and my plan was to do that until the day i dropped right but this particular year so i used to come home every year after doing the roller coasters and my head would just hurt and i would tell my mom you know i don't think this is really healthy for me if my head hurts after doing this because it probably all that emotion is probably not good for my brain but it was just a passing thought it wasn't really a serious belief until the concussion so i'm on the very last ride of the day it's at a cedar po in sanduski ohio and i'm on the raptor my favorite ride there and something about that ride that day it came to really an abrupt stop and it felt like my brain wanted to keep going even though the scull stopped it my entire field of vision went down to this tiny little dot and then came sucking back and i was just like stunned and the ride's over my friends are like hey what are you doing come on we got to get off the ride and i just i just i wasn't there and that scared me and my headache didn't just last for a couple hours it lasted for well probably like a week and a half so i went to see the doctor i got diagnosed with a concussion and and my balance which used to be great because i would do a lot of one one-legged stands and things in yoga now my balance was terrible i thought oh this is not good because this really affected me so i started doing the doctor google and looking up things like what what's the protocol for brain healing and found that hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a big treatment for boxers football players anybody dealing with a tbi or a concussion so i didn't really want to spend that kind of money but i found a clinic close by i drive about an hour to get there and started doing sessions and then i started on some peptides like cable lyson you know for the bdnf just anything i could find that would be a treatment for the for the brain and i i and now i do a lot of i guess you would say balance board type of things trying to get my balance back i i posted a thing few things on youtube where i'm playing around with a slack line in my backyard yeah i saw that yeah i'm i'm bad at it and i don't mind looking like a complete idiot you know in front of people but it's something that if i keep doing i know i'm gonna get better at and just in the i've only done it like five times and then i haven't done it again since but each time i did it i filmed it and put it out on youtube or not youtube on instagram i meant to say yeah um i know if i stick with it i i'll get a lot better with it because i saw a lot of improvement just in those two little or five little times and now i bought a board for indoors that's got a slack line built into it it's called a a gib a gibbons board so now in the winter time i can do the slack line stuff indoors without having to go out in the backyard in the snow so i am working a lot on my balance just to try to bring that back to what it used to be i'm getting there so having seen you on that balance like in trying to balance it was like it looks like a rubber band a giant rubber band i wouldn't say that's someone that's had a head injury and his balance is or you know your balance is terrible i didn't even consider you know the decades earlier head injury it just looks like you know that wasn't even decades that was 2021 so we're talking what four years ago oh the roller coaster oh that was just a few years ago all right but i didn't get that sense that you had some kind of head injury and then your balance was terrible you just look like a regular person on a on a trying to balance it didn't look which should be good news right so yeah yeah no i i feel i feel good about it i just i suck like a normal person now instead of suck like sucking like a injured person so do you think the hbot helped in that case and the peptides too i i like to think it did i don't have any way of measuring that now i'm g to be doing another series of hbot in conjunction with the stem cells that i'm going to be getting so i've got 10 of those lined up and i may do another another 10 after that so where are the stem cells injected it's just into blood and then that they can circulate so in this case i'm doing um it's a therapeutic dose because i so another weak spot is i'd like to blame it on p90x but i have a a rotator cuff impingment and got to show my elbows i'm actually i gave plasma today so that's why i'm taped up on both arms um this elbow doesn't straighten out there was a time when back in the days of facebook where there was a a thing that was going around where you would do 22 push s for 22 days to bring awareness to suicide for veterans and i i have some of those videos are still out on venmo and i think i they might even i think they're available on my website really and not intentionally but they're still there they're still publicly accessible i know some people have watched them but i would do a different set of push-ups each day for those 22 days getting progressively harder and crazier each time and i would practice the more advanced ones while i was still filming the the more basic ones and in the practice for one that involved a u i guess it's a stability ball there's one where you you would do the push-up start off with the stability ball out to extension you'd come down you'd push off and bounce up with the stability ball off the ground and then catch yourself again before you before you smash your face in the ground and in doing that i i ended up like airing something in this elbow and i don't know if you can see in the video i can straighten this one out perfectly this one cannot it's still got a nice bend to it it won't it healed awkwardly but uh like strengthen that arm i mean it not dramatically worse it's just you can't you can't straighten your arm well since then i've gotten the strength back because this this is my i'm left-handed that's my more dominant arm the strength has come back but i'm still limited in in motion with that so i've got the elbow impingement elbow yeah what do you call it the shortening the shoulder impingement one of my knees is starting to feel a little funky so anyway i'm getting doses in all of those and systemic as well so also all right wait so then supplements so bad i hope that i hope that works out i hope the st yeah uh i know what it feels like to have the shoulder impingement like you know o from doing overhead presses it's happened to everyone on sure in time and they are misery like like it feels almost like grant i've never had a dislocated shoulder but it's i get you i get you on that one it's incom that i had got it fixed and i messed it up again immediately because there's a little thing called club exomes dr sandra kaufman and stephen mccain run it so i went out to vegas i got the exome treatment and i felt amazing for the first time ever that night i was able to sleep on this shoulder and not feel any pain and so i'm like i am cur well you know idiot it takes many weeks to really heal from something like that but i was starting to feel my oats and thinking like i was superman when i got home i have a pair of olympic like gymnastic rings hanging from the tree in the backyard that i always loved playing on so i got right back onto those and i was doing my flips and things and my chinups and re inverse chinups and all that and i felt it i ended up messing it right back up again so now i know when i get these stem cells to go easy not try to be superman do the hbot do the other peptides that are going to come along with the treatment and there's ozone that's going to go come along with the therapy do all the things take the time heal go through the rehab routines all of that and then once like months from now when i'm healed maybe i can start playing with that stuff again so wait so the exosomes are from you they're they're taking plasma they nope yeah they're they're exogenous exomes but where they'd have to come from somewhere from someone lenal derived aha interesting the same with the stem cells so technically you could take exosomes from uh like prof you can isolate them from blood or exosome circulate in blood so just if you get them from plasma you know just find a high cord blood from cord yes from cord blood from you know from the newborn but i'd imagine if you got you know got it from an elite athlete or more elite i guess or someone who uh is 20 years old exosomes from a 20-year old yeah this rejuvenation capacity may be better exosomal ability to rejuvenate may be better you know well i mean supposedly the rejuvenation capacity of a newborn is that's true that's true yeah yeah yeah and the stem cells too it's from it's placenta derived or yeah yeah because i'm at i'm at an age now where trying to get it out of my own fat or bone marrow it's not be that beneficial if i i would have done that i should have banked that you know decades ago but they didn't have it decades ago for me so wasn't really an opportunity so how do you balance a potential overuse injury versus trying to repair damage that may be from overuse right it what if what if the exosomes and everything else can't repair and it's just a matter of volume training volume considered that's it's a good question i don't know yeah not going to do any stupid things again i mean like where i i know there's potential for injury but i also don't wna i don't want to stop what i'm doing because of my age right i know you've said it many times i've said it too being good for your age those are fighting words for me that's dirty words yeah i don't want to be good for my age i want to be good for any age right yeah no i get you there but it you know it's like the car can only you know you can can fix it fix the car as much as you want but the fact is if the car is still traveling a million miles a day maybe if the car went 500 i don't know some some prescribed dose where you're still getting the benefit of elite fitness but you know you're now now you're it's less you know wear and tear on the joints i don't know that it can be i don't i don't know that it can be repaired with xon themselves i hope that he can i don't either i don't either i'm willing to give it a try it was uh it was quite the the shell out of of cash that i didn't want to part with but it's an experiment it's going to be an expensive experiment i'm willing to see what happens with it just from the the benefit that i got just from the the exomes that was so profound to me that i'm thinking that this should be a good thing and in speaking with them the consult prior to i guess there are people that don't really respond well and others are they like to refer to with super responders and because of the experience that i had with the exomes of feeling that relief immediately they think i might be a super one of those super responders so we'll see could it be a dose too where you' need to get it not just once every half couple months but maybe once a day once a week like you got to get the dose too yeah potentially for like a therapeutic dose for really bad injury it uh like every three months they recommend a redo so don't know whether i'll need another dose three months from now or not kind of hoping not or sooner i mean maybe that you got immediate relief tells me that you know it's just a dose thing it's just uh the way they explained it they say that the um the exosomes are very shortl lasting yeah the stem cells will keep going for a good three months and so that's why they give they they say a three-month cycle because really just about the time that the stem cells are no longer giving you benefit would be that three-month portion where you could get another hit and stay consistent nice all right so h this is this is where it comes to the you know dave pasco is underrated hbot stem cells exosomes like most people are not doing this and plasma plasma donations most people aren't doing that either so pl but plasma donations that's to what to dump iron to lower fertin is or is that's just to uh no getting rid of uh you know degr degradated proteins you i look at it like um changing the oil in your car right you know as you as you go on you could not change the oil in your car ever if you don't want to but you're going to keep accumulating all that you know waste and the broken down the engine components that are wearing down the gunk that builds up i look at our our plasma the same way i think that's one of the benefits of getting plasma fis is and i know people will pay 10 grand to go get their plasma removed and replaced with albumin because you're dumping all of those old proteins that your body's no longer clearing so you're getting rid of all that gunk and you're now starting with a fresh clean slate and then if you did young blood on top of that you might even be getting some beneficial proteins from younger people which is yet another level up but i can't afford young blood i'm not probably never going to be able to afford that um or young plasma i don't know why they call it young blood it sounds more interesting that way i guess so instead of spending 10 grand on plasma fis just go make regular plasma donations it's sort of the same thing based on the the donation size that they take from me each time it works out to replacing my entire plasma blood volume every four and a half to five donations wow so but then the i think the weakness potential weakness there is you would assume that your body would so you're dumping basic right i get it makes sense where there could be a buildup of stuff and that buildup of stuff is bad systemically because you can't get rid of stuff you should be getting rid of all right so you dump it and then the idea is your body should be making new fresh proteins and metabolites and all the things right but what if that's less and less the case with age right then um it's like you can't win either way in that case so i look at it the other way you know it's for me it's it's uh i get the plasma fis i get the data i i've seen all that data you know but it's i'm still not sold like i don't want to i don't want to be tied to a young animal and blood connect you know all the all the crazy stuff with that but you know so my approach is how can i optimize the system so that the blood is young so i don't have to dump it and i don't have to worry about a blood transfusion what is that recipe right so yeah um yeah so i look at it like that i know they only allow you to give whole blood every 60 days or every 56 days and that's only because it takes that long to build up red cells you could technically donate even more but they like to be on the extreme safe side make it 56 days they do the same thing with the plasma because you can donate plasma twice a week because your body just regenerates it that quickly interesting so that's that's why i'm not really concerned about you know those those proteins do you see a difference in biomarkers or subjective feel when you donate pl no change no and i i've tried because i really really thought hey maybe this will be maybe this will give me the next you know bump up on my pace of aging score but no h spot plasma you know nothing no change all right so plasma donation exosomes hbot stem cells there's there's other stuff on the list you've got a smart house what what what uh what technology defines your house as a smart house well i have a mix of technologies because everything is from a different company so all of my blinds are levelor blinds they're all they're all powered so they open and close and adjust their you know their pivot at different times of the day depending on the sun and um all of my lighting i i when i remodeled the house i put recess lights in all the rooms and so every bulb is a ph philips hue bulb it's capable of any color or any intensity and each one is bluetooth enabled and they're all controlled via a um samsung smart oh wait actually that one's controlled by a phillips hue hub but i also have a samsung smart things hub that integrates with the levelor it integrates with the phillips it integrates with um all of my light my light switches are levron zigg and zwave controlled switches so those all also are controlled by the smart things hub so i can program everything via that one that one hub and in each room i have a um it's a amazon echo dot i don't want to refer to her by her name otherwise i will invoke her right now and i won't be able to shut her up but there's one of those in every room and um gosh what else oh even my faucets they're touch faucets but they're also network enabled so like i can take my aqua true picture and put it in the sink and i can say i'm gonna call her aelia right now i will say amelia please tell delta to fill my picture and i can walk away and it'll fill the picture to the right amount without overflowing and wasting any water and come back and take it and put it back in the thing i mean just silly little gimmicks like that right but it's when you buy things now that are new they all come with this enablement so even all of my tvs are smart tvs so they're i have them all set right now with a i have one tv in every room of the house they all come on and and turn off automatically so i don't have to deal with them and they're all programmed to the same thing so i have a a google what is it the google chrome device that powers all of them so when i'm watching one of your videos if i'm not glued to it right on my phone um it's playing on all the tvs so as i'm walking through the house doing my housework i can see you just follow from him room even down in the basement into the laundry room my workout area you know the whole nine er or if i'm listening to podcasts i'll have them you know chrome chromecast to the tvs that way so it's in every room high-tech house all wait so the lights the lights got me so i guess you vary the what is see minimize blue light at a certain time yeah yeah in the evening as the sun begins to set their programm and sun of course setting is variable but part of the smart things hub is it's always connected to the internet so it knows as the sun is changing it varies its routines based on you know sunrise sunset so it begins to uh shift well actually immediately shifts everything to red and then throughout the evening it progressively dims and dims and dims until it's time for me to go to bed so if i'm home or not it's gna follow this this program so when i'm out of town to the neighbors it looks like i'm home because all the lights are coming on doing their thing and the blinds are coming up and going down and uh but when i go to bed since i go to bed a lot earlier than 11 o'clock is when i have all that timed i will tell her amelia good night and she then goes through her routine to make sure that every light and everything in the house is all turned off at that point and then in the mornings when i wake i say amelia good morning and she says good morning and uh you know today's date and you know here's the weather in your city and here's what's on your calendar for today and she tell me a little fun fact and then uh so while she's doing all that i'm doing my my stretching and my morning routine while i'm still in bed but then she reads me the or or plays for me the news on uh cnn fox news and abc news so i'm filling my mind with what's going on out in the world because then i put all that stuff away and i don't want to hear anymore of it but at least i know what's going on in the world and i know what what my day is going to consist of because she just told me my schedule so i'm thinking about okay what do i have to prepare for while i'm doing my stretching while i've got my my beamer which is underneath me running and you know hopefully helping my blood flow and circulation and my got the nano v strapped in with the little canula i'm inhaling the the the the wonderful vapors that are coming from that which are also helping with my protein misfolding uh and oxidative stress so i'm like doing all these stacking all these biohacks while i'm still in bed listening to to her chatting in my ear it's 2001 in space odyssey do you ever worry that the the house is gonna go i know it's a dumb question but a house is gonna go rogue i've wondered about somebody hacking into it and like really messing with me so that's that's a possibility but i do have a i have a hardware firewall because i'm a i was a network security guy so i know how to do you know network firewalls and so i have a pretty good firewall in place hopefully i'm not inviting people to try to hack through it right now but put this out there all right so also pf so i guess you're using electromagnetic uh radiation or specific frequencies to try to enhance what rejuvenation so what what yeah my my amp coil i use mostly for uh recovery so there's lots of detox and recovery protocols in that so i really love it for that um the beamer is is i don't even know how to describe it it's it's it's kind of pf but not it's on the same the same level of pmf but their claim to fame they have you know you know you can only claim so many things according to the fda based on the studies that you can prove so their claim to fame is u you know blood flow it helps with bring being able to bring red cells into the the finer capillaries of the body i'm sure it does a lot more things than that but that's the only thing that they can really make claim to so yeah so i like to use pemf just for my recovery and just helping to keep me keep me going so do you notice a difference with all of the stuff that you're doing uh pretty regularly when you travel and then do you notice subjectively or i mean granted you have the the travel jet lag and all that messing with you but like is it it's got to be night and day in terms of or or maybe not like when i travel it's it's funny because i'm i'm so used to being able to wake up in the middle of the night with my sleep mask still on and just ask amelia what time it is without having to pick it up and go you know look turn a light on and mess with my circadian rhythms right um and i can't tell her good morning or good night when i'm in a hotel so that's that's a little odd what was your what was your i know i'm not answering your question no no so just do you notice a difference i mean granted the routine is different but like you know is it a subjective thing where it's like if i don't do the uh the mat and i don't do the you know the if you're not doing all the things you don't notice it you don't don't notice it but it's no i don't i don't notice any major difference i mean i know they're doing good things for me it's just i i can't measure them if that makes sense yeah i can't quantify them so is there like a biohack or hacks or interventions that you've done where it's just like this is essential i've gota i'm granted eating cleanings in sticking to the workout approach and getting good sleep foundation but taking that a step above where it's like you you saw your biomarkers and you're like all right i'm g to try this and i'm gna try that to move the needle here and then it move the needle like do you have any examples of stuff like that yeah a sauna made a huge difference for me i i saw that um i my appearance is more vascular thanks to the sauna because it seems to be melting away that subcutaneous fat plus i feel just absolutely amazing after a sauna so when i don't get a sauna session in i i really miss that i do feel the absence of that um a supplement example would be uh nicotinamide riboside or nr so there was a time when i was doing my p90x workouts probably about 55 maybe 54 at age 54 i started seeing that it was taking me more than an hour to get through an hour p90x workout just because my energy wasn't there um then i heard on a podcast has something about you know nad levels and how they decline with age and then there was this product called true niagen so again thinking this is [ __ ] this isn't going to do anything for me i'll give it a try let's see what happens i took it and on the third day of taking it i didn't feel anything different going about my day so there was nothing at all subjective about you know no change but when i did my p90x workout for that day i felt amazing i got through the p9 x workout you know in the hour time and i still had so much energy left i did another one just because i could because i wanted to see where's where's the bottom end of this where where does this floor drop out of this energy because this is amazing i've been doing that ever since so wait what dose of nr and then have you measured n levels i have yeah because i started just recently last year i started seeing the same thing i started to see that my energy levels were dropping off and i assumed it was probably nr related because i was doing just the base dose i think it's 300 milligrams i'd have to go back and look um so so i did two tests i did one from do not age and i did the gfinity test and they they both came back and told me that my nad was still just at the low end in the lower range of optimal but still within optimal so i knew that wasn't dead and then i guess this would be one of those one of the many dumb dumb supplement things that i did was i did a spectra cell micronutrient analysis and based on that i found that i had a b vitamin deficiency i'm like wait what how can i have a b vitamin deficiency i supplement in b vitamins this makes no sense so then i had to take a really deep dive and figure out what what is it that i'm doing and taking or eating or drinking that has the potential to be absorbing or blocking my absorption of b vitamins and i found that it was the um i i do a lemon tea in the mornings i make a very or i was brewing a very strong brew of many different types of tea i had um po a oong um gosh well green black i can't even think of them all right now there were at least five different teas that i would mix i mix them quite strong and i would brew them i put you know crushed lemon juice in there and humic and fulvic minal minerals which i still do but i realized i had found this before that by doing this tea i was impacting my fertin levels previously they were getting they were being driven way too low took me a while to figure out which was what was doing that but then i backed off on like the dosage like how strong how many tea bags i would use and the fertin level thing resolved itself but i didn't realize it was still impacting my b vitam it was blocking i guess it's something to do with the polyphenols were blocking the uptake of the b vitamins somehow they were interfering with the receptors so once i took out the tea completely i just threw it right out of my routine my next test came back normal and everything was good again and my energy level popped back up again too interesting it's like there's never enough stuff to measure it's like always yeah it's like whacka you fix one thing and then five things pop up too the nr story is interesting because nicotin or nn right which is in the same ballpark uh it's nicotinamide based um 300 milligrams doesn't make a dent on my nad it it yeah but then you know i'm sure you know that 50 milligrams of nicotinic acid is basically the equivalent of one gram of nmn but uh but that it's different you know different for you you got a boost with 300 right so but uh so many other things that come into play there too have you checked like your cd38 to make sure that's not impacting your your haven't measured cd38 but the argument against that is 65 grams of fresh parsley which is about 100 milligrams of apen per day and uh i find it hard to believe the cd38 wouldn't be lower and then the other other argument too is that ned can be degraded into trigonelline and my trigonelline levels before all those trelian experiments through diet was like almost zero like completely none which suggests no n degradation into trigonelline so yeah i don't know it could be it could be something else infection could be a lot of things it infection that's not related to cd38 i i don't know still trying to figure out it's fun how all this stuff interrelates you you mess with one thing and it can change so many other things yeah but fascinating to learn about yeah but we're like such early days you know ai eventually is going to crunch all of the data all of the metabolomics and you know we're only still looking at a snapshot like metabolomics it's like 4,000 metabolites or more we're only looking at 600 you know and the epigenetics is just one modification you know there's acetalation you know there's there's other epigenetic modifications besides methylation so we're just still look you know how much of the picture are we looking at we're looking at the corner piece and we're trying to tell what's going on right so yeah the iolo data just kind of blows my mind because that's a whole bunch of other markers i've never ever considered before yeah so i'm focused on uh the kindur to trip thean ratio which i think totally underrated most people don't know about it um it's activated that you know stp defend degrades into conine and then uh it inflaming basically activates that enzyme so um and it increases during aging higher levels associated with an increased all cause mortality risk um and some of the centenarian studies that i'm working with in academia we see that that exact pattern uh higher curine lower tryp toan so more degradation of trp thean during aging so i think that's totally underrated i've been you know originally i was yelling about uh albumin nobody was thinking about albumin and i mean it's the most abundant circ protein and now more people are thinking about albumin besides glucose and lipids curine and chopan and erine are on that list too but it's not ergine no matter how much i push i can't get iola to include ergine uh but maybe one day um but the nicotinamide have you measured i don't i don't think i saw your homosysteine because in my case the nicotinamide even very low doses may push it higher do you remember off top of your head homosysteine no but it's low it wasn't it wasn't alarming to me at all so nice yeah because in randomized control trials nicotinamide increases homy more than nicotinic acid so uh and then you hear the thing we'll take tmg and tmg doesn't work for me for whatever reason so then uric acid comes into play there somewhere it could in my case uric acid is low uh unless i increase sardines too much or increase protein intake too much but sardines are fantastic but you've actually you've resisted the age related i don't know should we go through some blood test data we could i don't know how i mean i could go forever with you know it's up to you i i could too all right i i don't want to bore you you know i don't wanna uh i mean i've already missed my my dinner hour but that's all right i i can keep going what do you think so we call it now and then go for another i'm i'm game really game keep going if you want to keep going yeah i don't wanna i don't want to miss dinner time and i i don't want you to be like god damn it i missed it because that mother would shut up no no i'm i i don't know if you've heard this about my protocols but when it comes to my routines i will gladly set a routine aside to spend quality time with somebody you know that's that to me that's way more important because at the end of my days when i'm laying on a hospital bed somewhere assuming for a moment i don't get hit by a bus or you know some other immediate death but if i'm laying in a hospital bed somewhere and i'm staring up at a acoustic tile ceiling and fluorescent lighting listening to this beeping and wishing wor wishing of machines keeping me alive you know am i going to be there regretting that oh gosh i didn't get to eat dinner on time that day because i wasted that time with michael right no no in fact it would be completely the opposite it would be like you idiot you had this opportunity to spend with mike why did you like blow him off to go do some stupid routine that really in the long run doesn't matter i get you high five my friend high five yes put a b at voice i don't know if you like that movie i thought because i got i had goofy questions too you know like uh the aliens like what's going on with the aliens right but you know that's uh they live right down the street for me that's right it was uh wait was it in michigan where that was uh wait so let's backtrack what's let's backtrack do do you do you think that uh aliens are real so look i'm not just longevity i like to think about stuff that could be true maybe it's true right and i like to live on that edge of could be crazy as hell but also could be brilliant and you know so i think they're real 100% real they may have actually been here and have always been here may have co-evolved on the planet with us where you know right now you could have primitive human species and then us who's to say there isn't a more advanced species that's uh either evolved you know uh for hundred million years uh already before us tinkered with dna to enhance our evolution i don't know i just it's fun to think about it's speculation i don't have the answers so what are your thoughts on the whole well when you look at like the aztecs the incas the mayans you know all these ruins that we examine from you know centuries ago and they have these lines that are like dug in the earth and these patterns that can only be seen from space what i mean come on there's no other purpose for that terrestrially than to signaling somebody way out in the atmosphere you know that that can see that and the technologies that they had seemed far too advanced it's somehow it's technology that has been lost to civilization how did they get it when you look at the pyramids and how they've been built and you know the the structures and the stones that are placed that are tons mega tons with you can't even fit it like a playing card between them the precision is just so perfect come on we can't we can't even do stuff like that today so how in the heck did they do that then they had to have some help so yeah i'm not a big alien conspiracy guy although you know i love you know ufo stuff and uh i like watching that kind of stuff on tv and movies and when i was a kid that there was a book called in search of ancient astronauts that came out that i read and i think they made that movie in fact there was a series that became called insert j of that was sort of launched from that all about aliens and things love that as a kid i'm thinking they're probably there but they're just too advanced for us to detect yeah so it there may two things going on there one it may i'm not saying aliens built the pyramids and machu picchu and all of these megalithic ne i'm saying they might have been influenced by those but yeah could be uh i don't know but the the like uaps where they're trans medium and they got video where they're dipping it into the water and then the there's no splash and it's like they've got gravity bubble and the warp drive whatever that is what the hell like what the hell you know and then even like so when you think about we evolve to survive right our senses are just primitive for survival right we can't see in the infrared we can't hear ultrasound so great modify our genes to be able to do something like that but yeah or we invent the tech right we invent the tech to see those things right so but like there are videos where you've gota you know it's in the infrared and you can see them but you can't visually see them right so and if if you think like if you're an advanced civilization or alien whichever it may be ultraterrestrial crypto terrestrial you know i don't know where they're coming from but i don't want to be bothered by the primitive monkeys shooting missiles at me right i'm going to cloak right in the stealth technology so i'm just fascinated like yeah for me it's like learning if there is a higher level to this and humans aren't the highest that exists uh i'd want to be able to learn from that whatever it may be you know so yeah it's cool when you think about like there's so many levels of the uh of the light spectrum that are just completely out of our reach we don't even know that they exist so there's that whole spectrum of reality that we have that we're completely out of touch with animals dogs how they have the sense of smell that we don't have you know detect bombs they can detect cancer you know we can't do that that's a so that's another level of reality that we're unaware of it makes me wonder how much stuff is going on around us that we just don't know about because we can't perceive it yeah exactly so psychedelics that gets me into psychedelics what any ever i have not tried any but i'm really curious to in michigan we can't really get our hands on stuff like that i know my my friends out on the west coast are like yeah come on out i can hook you up you know no problem so i i would be really curious to try iasa or um oh gosh what are some of the other ones sal salin yeah i have i have done i did mushrooms once with some friends when i was out in vegas that was just sort of interesting all i saw were halos around lights and uh felt really blissful but other than that i didn't didn't have any great trip maybe we didn't use enough i don't know that but that's still a sibin right so you did i suppose that was yeah yeah but it wasn't like it wasn't like a great dose where i had a journey or anything like that i haven't done any of that stuff at least psilocybin i want to include that at some point just the idea like when you were saying about how much of our senses can detect reality and what's going on around us i mean from anecdotal mushroom experiences right magic mushroom experiences it seems like there's all this weird stuff in shapes and sounds and and it's like how wait is that is that like chemical po i don't know i'm just interested and fascinated you know can can i expand my consciousness to see more than i can currently see and perceive you know and and then even too like the brain signaling i don't know if you've seen like psilocybin brain signaling without it and with it it's like it's brains that have been imaged at least what i've seen it's like you know you get a certain amount of brain that lights up just normally and then with psilocybin it's like vast networks interconnected communicating with each other it didn't exist before yeah so um that's cool that's really cool yeah curious about that so yeah i want to go to daniel aon's clinic and get a spec scan in fact i've got another friend of mine who uh who's had a tbi and i've been for last year trying to get him to go with me because he needs it more than i do um to both for both of us to go get scanned and i think that we're going to try to do it this october or november if we can fit it in but i would love to see if i have any lingering effects from my concussion does the peru vote wouldn't the peruo cover full body mri wouldn't they do brain it would it's i think peruo is more structural where the spec scan is more functional if that makes sense so if there was structural damage the peruo would see it but the the spec scan would light up you know more functionally they would see different parts either dark or light or super bright depending on yeah what's going on in my head yeah i wonder what what they would do for uh rejuvenating the brain functionally in that case or even structurally right because it's not like you're out i mean do you drink alcohol i mean it's uh i do not not a lot i mean compared my my friends tend to think of me as a non-drinker because compared to them i kind of am but but i do like to drink a beer occasionally in fact just what was it monday i went out with friends um to a mexican place where we do margaritas now i skipped the margaritas i only did a beer because i was doing an organic acids test urine test and i didn't want to really screw that up so so i skipped out on that but yeah i do drink occasionally yeah so it's not like you're you know alcohol you know drinking all the time which i'd imagine would be bad bad for brain health right so how do you take someone who's already healthy and fit and you know very moderate alcohol intake non-smoker right you don't smoke right so never have how do you further improve upon that i don't know that conventional medicine knows how right because if they could they'd rejuvenate you know neur degenerative diseases right if it was that simple so i'd be curious to know what how they would do that well i did look up some of the protocol that they would use at the aman clinic you know for brain healing and and hbot is definitely one of those uh the cerebral lysin peptide um what else was there cmax i think is another one or c lank i think are the are the three yeah i think most of those are what they use for brain healing there may be other things but those were the only four things that are really picked up on i know dave asprey likes to do like i think his mapel um some other um some of those other like uh i don't know what you would call those smart smart drugs i guess neut tropics neutr neut tropics there you go well yeah i have done some new tropics like i've tried uh alphab brain i've tried um gosh qualus product qualum mind i really kind i really liked that one when it first came out i don't use those very often um but some of the the really um the big ones like the bio the big biohackers like dave asey and ben greenfield are using those are interesting to me i just it's not something i can get my hands on although recently i did find a place that i might be able to order them from so i might give those a shot just to see it's like what would you look at you know in terms of output biomarkers you know that efficacy right that's the tricky thing yeah i know well you know dave can do all his 40 years of zen type scanning for his so i don't have that available to me it might help me be able to come up with words quicker and faster when i'm doing interviews love to do it before interviews all the time right i don't even think you're 62 it's like a magic number it's like crazy i don't see you at 62 at all which is nuts i you know i get that a lot in fact they were they were laughing today when i went to do this um plasma donation because it was a i went to a new place not the same place i used to go and the guy's like this okay there's some there's an error here in your dat or your year birth not right and i said what what does it say and he says you know 62 i says no that's right he's like wait you're 62 years old i'm like yeah and so then this guy kept bragging to all the nurses like hey how old do you think this guy is you know i'm like all right i might have had a shot with that nurse until you just blew it for me things but you know just dumb stuff like that like when i was in italy probably shouldn't say this because my friend will see this but was out to dinner with my buddy who's the exact same age i am we're eating dinner and the waiter comes up he's like oh is this your dad i'm like no no and friend he thought your friend was your dad yeah holy cow friend was sitting right across the table from me but he was looking at the menu and he's a little hard of hearing so i don't think he caught that but i was so embarrassed for him i'm like oh my gosh no don't say that does he look 20 years or so older than you he looks his age you know i i don't i don't i'm not trying to throw him under the bus i don't think i don't think he looks he's a handsome looking guy but he looks his age so wait yeah i know i know you dye your hair so if you didn't dye your hair absolutely yes and and had i get botox in my forehead too to remove the uh it was getting big deep rut a lot of that i don't i don't i don't know if you can see i got a lot of that yeah that's exactly what i was getting in i it wouldn't go away right when when you did that on purpose then it showed but as soon as you relax it goes away yeah was not going away oh i could still see the lines they were still there and like okay that this has got to go i would see it in pictures i'm like no oh no that's got to go so how often how often do you do that well most people will do it like every six to eight months i'm told i'm way too active for that i sweat too much i run too much uh my metabolism is too fast i end up having to do it maybe every eight weeks instead of every eight months and i i did try botox it made i had a little bit of a reaction to it my eyes would itch like never stopped itching the whole like eight weeks that i had it and then i switched to um d disport or dport is another option tried that same thing and uh then they tried me on zamin which i guess the these things only differ by some minor little protein in the chain and and zaman seem to work for me i don't have any sort of itching allergic reaction to that one so but it's just in the forehead it's or i don't know i i get it right along the the top line here because when i didn't i was getting a weird roll like my friend looked at me one day and he's like are you wearing a wig i'm like no what do you mean i i thought well maybe since i dye my hair get my roots colored i thought maybe he was just seeing the the white from the roots but then when i went and looked in the mirror later at myself i'm like oh my gosh yeah there's a there's a strange roll right there it's i guess it's where the the muscle there's a muscle there that somehow naturally ends so that's the edge of it and yeah it just looked funny and so i mentioned that to them the next time i was in there and like oh yeah oh okay we can we can go up a little bit higher and we can take care of that so they did um and i did have i did try my eyes but i didn't like it it gave me it gave me a funny eye look and the thing was when i got it done when i saw myself in the mirror i recognized that same look in some other people without name and names without name and names without naming names there's a very well friends people i know yes but also there's a very famous actor that's on a a is in a sitcom or was in a series i haven't seen it lately so maybe it'll come out again this fall but a very popular guy he was in sci-fi stuff you know early on and then you know was in this new series and there was something about his eyes that just looked odd to me i had the same eyes so i recognize it right away oh okay he's getting botox in his eyes that's why it makes perfect sense and then the beard the beard too you've got to be dying the beard oh oh yeah absolutely the hair i'll get colored because i can't do it myself i can't see the back but the beard i do i do myself right after i get the hair but then you you'd have white hairs everywhere i guess they don't you just shave shave no my my arm hairs are still black my leg hairs are still black and then eyebrows eyebrows yeah i don't touch any it's all still natural so um that's how i know like people say oh well you're dyeing your hair what's your natural color i said well this this is my hair is naturally black i could go brown but then if i did brown it would look funny the light's just dimmed it's it's getting late yeah we're starting the evening wind down here so yeah me crank it back up again i could probably tell amelia but i don't really want to do that that's right we can we can wrap i don't you know it's all good so just to finish that thought though i was gonna say that the um my chest hair at one point was totally white so that i had to shave because that looked funny right but then somewhere along the line i don't know what's doing it now the chest hair is 50/50 oh interesting and i think that's really cool if i knew exactly what was doing it i would do more of it so that i could get all of it to go back to it could be n i've seen anecdotally people with the ned stuff so yeah maybe maybe i don't know all right cool well thanks dave i greatly appreciate you coming on hopefully sometime relatively soon uh we got all the blood test stuff and you know biomarker stuff we didn't
