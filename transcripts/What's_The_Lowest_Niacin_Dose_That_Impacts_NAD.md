# What's The Lowest Niacin Dose That Impacts NAD?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that lowd does nicotinic acid more specifically 60 mig per day increased nad but what's the lowest dose of nicotinic acid to impact nad so to address that for a march 4th test i sent blood to gfinity for intracellular ned analysis blood intracellular ned analysis and if you want to measure your own ned levels there's a discount link in the video's description so from the last test until the day before this test on march 4th average nicotinic acid intake was 27 milligram per day and i log my supplement intake and food intake every day uh using chronometer so that's how i know these amounts but we can be more specific with how much nicotinic acid before the test two weeks before testing average daily nicotinic acid was 38 milligram per day and even more specifically more specifically one week before testing it was 45 mig per day so we've got a lower dose than the 60 mig will 4 5 increase ned but there's another metabolite that can potentially impact ned and that's trigonelline and if you miss that recent video it'll be in the right corner so i've been trying to increase dietary intake of trigonelline with the goal of it on its on its own increasing nad so for one week before testing average trigonelline was was my highest the date 51 milligram per day so did that combination impact nad and unfortunately it did not we can see that my nad for the march 4th test was 26.3 micromolar which is not higher than my levels without ned precursors which as shown by these seven tests are in the 18.5 to 26.6 micromolar range in contrast with ned precursors ned has been higher than 26.6 micromolar for seven tests with the exception of 300 mig of nmn per day which didn't move the needle 25.3 micromolar so to answer the question what's the low was dose for nicotinic acid to increase nad it's still still 60 mig per day in my case as the combination of 45 coming from nicotinic acid and 51 milligram per day tri trigonelline didn't increase or move the needle in terms of nad so with that in mind what's the next experiment so half of that 51 mig per day of trigonelline one week before testing came from alfalfa sprouts as i was eating about 100 grams of those per day and at those amounts it's a decent source of trigonelline now there is a food or a sprouted food potentially sprouted food that has higher levels of telion relative to alphalpha and that's red clover seeds now i don't know if they're in the sprouts i searched pubmed for studies that looked at trigonelline content in red clover seed sprouts wasn't able to find that but the clover seeds have 5x more trigonelline than alfalfa sprouts so for the next ned experiment the plan is to eat an equivalent amount of sprouts coming from clover seeds relative rel ative to alphalpha about 100 g per day which should 3x trigonelline from 50 to about 150 milligrams per day so if i was getting 25 from alfalfa clover seeds have 5x that's 125 milligrams and then 25 coming from my background from chickpeas and other foods that should be 150 milligrams of trigonelline per day so that's a 3x increase will that plus a much lower dose of nicotinic acid i'm only planning on using it on exercise days as it may have some benefit in terms of heart rate variability and resting heart rate recovery will that combination very low dose nicotinic acid with a 3x dose for trigonelline impact n the plan is to set in blood uh within the next few days either on friday or on this sunday so four days away so stay tuned for that data coming in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any quantification epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob and grim age green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
