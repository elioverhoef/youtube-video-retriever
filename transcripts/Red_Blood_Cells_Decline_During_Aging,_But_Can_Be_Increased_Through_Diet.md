If you had to guess the cell type that's the most abundant in the human body which would you guess there are approximately 30 trillion human cells in the human body not including the contribution from microbes 25 trillion of these cells come from red blood cells also known as erythrocytes so 84 of the total amount of cells in the human body are from red blood cells now red blood cell levels decline during aging so first starting it uh in youth red blood cell levels are of about 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter are found in men whereas uh 4.3 million red blood cells per microliter are found in women that's uh those are values for someone that's approximately 20 years old now superficially these numbers don't seem to match the data on the right but let's do a quick math calculation to show that these are the same as what we see on the left so rounding the 4.8 uh value for men up to five there are five million red blood cells per micro 5 million red blood cells per microliter there are 1 million microliters per liter and then there's approximately 5 liters of total blood volume in the average 70 kilogram man so when we multiply these data together we get a value of 25 trillion red blood cells so uh a similar calculation for women can be obtained using the 4.3 value that's found in youth with about four liters of blood volume that's found in women when you multiply those data together you get about 17 trillion red blood cells out of a total human uh a cell count of 21 trillion in women so 84 for both men and women uh are red blood cells of all the all their cells now as shown on the graph red blood cell levels decline during aging two values that are somewhere around 3.9 million red blood cells per microliter and as i'm going to show in this video the age-related decrease for red blood cells can be reversed through diet so let's have a look at the data so uh that's what we see here and uh we're looking at red blood cells on the left plot uh and then we're gonna uh show on the right how it how it uh uh blends into the age-related changes uh graph so uh i've got i've been tracking my own circulating biochemistry for at least 15 years i don't have data for all of the variables for 15 years for some i have data starting a little later so for red blood cells the earliest data that i have starts in 2008. Now back then i was only tracking my biomarkers about once a year every time i would go to the doctor and what we can see over six measurements over a five year period was that my average red blood cell count was 4.96 and uh so that would put me uh already off the chart uh relative to someone on you know that that was my chronological age so relatively high red blood cell uh counts are good because they carry oxygen your cells have oxygen to do uh to do metabolic work to produce energy etc uh i started getting more serious about tracking tracking more often through blood tests and then weighing all my food recall recording it into an excel file um recording you know the data that i would get after logging in online to get the macros and micros uh so i started getting more serious about that in 2015. So over 16 measurements from uh april about april 2015 to june of 2019 uh my average red blood cell count was significantly lower based on a t-test uh at 4.62 and when we put that data on the graph we can see that now i'm on the age-related curve almost identical for my age chronological age at that time um so then i was able to reverse this so looking at my blood test data for red blood cells starting in september 2019 to december of 2020 over eight measurements my average red blood cell count went up to 5.08 so now i'm a relative both relative to my age and uh you know my earlier data you know from 2008 now i'm off the charts uh so it from my perspective higher red blood cell counts are good because as i mentioned with less red blood cells circulating you'll have less hemoglobin uh less ability to carry oxygen and then your cells will have to rely on glycolysis which is less efficient than oxidative metabolism to generate atp so how was i able to do this how was i able to reverse this age this you know the age-related trend for uh declining red blood cell red red blood cell count so uh the primary reason i think that i was able to do that is because i i included yogurt into my diet now why why do i think uh that's the major explaining factor so here we're looking at my red blood cell count versus my average yogurt intake from 2015 to 2020. Now first when you notice the data on the left this is when i didn't eat any yogurt at all so the you know there's basically uh three and a half years of data where there was no yogurt at all in my diet and based on that we can see that the highest i was able to get my red blood cells up to was 4.8 with values as low as somewhere around 4.45 now once i started including yogurt into my diet whether it's about 250 grams a day or more about 450 grams a day i've never been lower than 4.9 and we can see that the correlation between my red blood cells with my average daily yogurt intake is strong so with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 a correlation coefficient of 1 is perfect so 0.91 is very strong uh the r squared so 82 of the variability in red blood cells can be explained by my you're going to take and the p value for the correlation between my red blood cells with yogurt is statistically significant significant as you can see by the p value now notice that milk equals whey plus cheese so if you add vinegar or an acid to milk if you add enough acid the milk will separate into the whey fraction and the cheese fraction so can uh looking at other dairy products offer more insight about how or why uh dairy or yogurt in this case may seem may be affecting my red blood cell levels so interestingly uh when looking at my whey protein intake versus uh my red blood cell counts we can see that the higher my weight protein whey protein intake the lower my red blood cell levels and this is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.61 38 of the variability in red blood cells explained by way uh and then it's a statistically significant uh correlation as shown by the p-value so this data goes in opposition to the yogurt intake if the whey fraction of yogurt or milk was driving the association with red blood cells we'd expect to see the correlation between whey with red blood cells going up so clearly the whey fraction of milk may not be the driving effect for the red blood cell levels going up well what about cheese uh so here we can see cheese plotted again my average daily cheese intake plotted against my red blood cell levels uh over the past two and a half years uh and similarly the way data is for the last two and a half years so the cheese association with red blood cells it's not statistically significant so even though the trend line looks up the p-value is not even nowhere close to statistical significance now notice that although milk equals weightless cheese yogurt is fermented milk now uh i measured my microbiome composition uh three times from 2017 to february 2019 and this is before i started including yogurt in my diet in i think september around september of 2019 so i have microbiome measurements that are in the complete absence of yogurt and for those three measurements there was literally no lactobacillus which is well known to be found in yogurt uh you know uh there's so there was no lactobacillus in my gut so um i think it's possible that lactobacillus may be driving uh erythropoiesis which is your body's uh ability to make new uh uh new red new red blood cells now there's no published data for that uh link between lactobacillus with making new red blood cells so if anyone has data like that leave a comment leave the paper um let's try to figure out why yogurt may be driving a higher level of red blood cells in my data now alternatively some may say that the increase in red blood cells is just due to dehydration because if you have the same amount of red red blood cells blood test the blood test but the latter blood test has less water in it it'll look like it's a higher red blood cell value even though the same amount of red blood cells would be in both measures so how can dehydration so can we address is this a dehydration related story uh so first how can dehydration be calculated from a blood test so uh the most common measurement is to measure the plasma osmolarity and then this is by calculating two times the sodium concentration uh plus glucose divided by 18 plus blood urea nitrogen bond divided by 2.8 and that all those data would then be in millimoles per liter so a higher plasma osmolarity would be indicative of being more dehydrated so in other words again if you have uh the same amount of solute but less water in one situation you'll have a higher osmolarity and that will be indicative of being more dehydrated so on the left we see my data for plasma osmolarity using my blood test results for sodium glucose and blood urine nitrogen and on the right we see my red blood cell counts that i just introduced in the slides before so if the increase in red blood cells is related to dehydration we'd expect to see a higher osmolarity so when looking at the data on the left for plasma osmolarity we can see that going from the 2015 to the 29 september 2019 measurements my average osmolarity went from about 291 to 289. Now this uh when looking at those two groups of data with a t-test uh the p-values 0.06 with a trend for a lower osmolarity so that would suggest that i'm uh more hydrated in the yogurt containing uh red blood cell related measurements not less hydrated so uh yeah so that's all i've got uh you can find me lots of places online and if you made it to the end thanks a lot and have a great day
