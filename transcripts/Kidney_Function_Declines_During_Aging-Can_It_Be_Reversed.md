Kidney function declines during aging but does it have to let's take a look at the data so first what we're looking at is a graph of kidney function uh plotted against age and what we can see is that uh kidney function starts off very high with the with an average uh estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr of about 125 in uh youth in 20 year olds and then it decreases to values around 50 in people uh that are 90 years old or older so uh what is that let's just break it down a little bit what does that even mean the gfr estimate or the egfr so um starting from a good kidney function egfr is at least 90 more than 90 but as we age kidney function can decline in this case i've pointed out stage 2 kidney disease which is a mild loss of kidney function which is defined as an egfr between 60 and 89. Now kidney function further declines during aging to moderate to severe loss of function with eg egfr values from 30 to 59 and for some kidney function can continue to decline with egfr values of 15 to 29 being stage 4 kidney disease where there's a severe loss of function or stage 5 kidney disease where egfr is 0 to 15. In that case people would need treatment to live such as hemodialysis so what about all-cause mortality risk well an egfr less than 45 is associated with an increased risk of death for all causes in a meta-analysis of 46 studies that included more than 2 million subjects that's what we can see here so when compared with subjects who had egfr values of 95 having an egfr less than 45 was associated with a significantly risk of a significant increase risk of death for all causes so can kidney function be improved during aging and uh what's my data so uh here we're looking at my blood test data starting in 2006 through 2013 and i've been tracking my own circulating biomarkers for about 15 years uh now back then i was only tracking about once a year when i'd go to the doctor i would just record all my data in an excel file um so what we can see is uh over eight measurements over that seven year period my average egfr was 86. So how does that how does that rank when we when looking at the uh age-related graph on the right so uh on the x-axis i've arrowed my age and then on the y-axis we can see my 86 egfr now before my age during that period we could have expected my uh egfr to be somewhere around 90. So one could say that i was uh my kidneys were aging at an average rate so what about since then i'm currently 48 so what about over the past eight years so starting in 2015 i started measuring uh my circulating biomarkers more often up to six times a year uh now based on the aging uh the age-related decrease for kidney function graph one could expect that my egfr should have been further reduced uh relative to the 86 somewhere around 78. So how's my data uh so that's we're looking at here so the 2015 to 2020 data for my egfr and what we can see is my average egfr has increased to somewhere around 97. So uh and i should say that these two groups of data are significantly different based on a t-test so i've actually uh reversed the age-related decline in kidney function and improved my kidney function closer towards youth and when extrapolating based on the curve these are average uh kidney function values that are found in someone about 15 years younger than my actual my chronological age so how have i improved my kidney function so uh in 2015 i started tracking uh weighing all my food and tracking macro and micronutrients so i have more than five years five and a half more actually it's up to 60 years now we're in a 2021. Uh almost six years of dietary data for macros and micros and then in july of 2018 i started uh logging the actual food intakes so i had 880 days of of tracked food intake that correspond to 13 egfr measurements so um let's start off with that data which food groups are strong strongly correlated with my egfr so um of all the food groups uh my average total vegetable uh a daily sorry my average daily vegetable intake in sum is correlated with a high gfr and that's what we're looking at here egfr plotted on the y-axis against my average daily vegetable intake and grams per day on the x-axis and what we can see is that the correlation coefficient between my average vegetable intake with egfr is strong with a correlation coefficient of 0.79 now the r squared for that then corresponds to 63 of the variability in egfr being explained by the sum of my vegetable intake every day and this correlation for egfr with my total vegetable intake is statistically significant based on the p-value now note that this isn't the recommended five servings of vegetables per day um this is uh almost at the high end up to 2000 grams of vegetables a day which corresponds to about 25 servings of vegetables a day using 80 grams as a standard serving size now uh included in that average vegetable intake are you know carrots pep red bell peppers lots of broccoli and cauliflower in addition to other other vegetables too so uh 63 of the variability in egfr being explained by my total vegetable intake is pretty good but can the inclusion of other foods explain more of the variance for kidney function so to examine that i then looked at food groups so that's what i've listed here so the sum of all my dairy intake which includes yogurt whey protein and cheese and then nuts and seeds now not all nuts and seeds are not the same they have different chemical composition including different fatty acid compositions so i separated my nuts and seeds into uh into groupings so saturated fat containing nuts and seeds for example cocoa beans and coconut butter which are mostly saturated fat mufa mostly monounsaturated fatty acid containing nuts and seeds so in that situation it would be um almonds uh pecans and peanuts which are rich in in monounsaturated fatty acids and then not all pufa polyunsaturated fatty acids are the same as they have differing uh saturate uh uh fatty acid uh concentrations for example flaxseed is rich in omega-3 whereas nuts like walnuts sesame seeds and sunflower seeds are rich in omega-6 so i group my uh nuts and seeds based on their primary uh fatty acid compositions um so then total vegetables fruit uh which uh which was my total sum of my berry intake uh sardines beef and eggs so all of those food groups those 10 variables i entered them into a backward elimination regression model and what does that mean so with that type of a regression model variables are sequentially removed um until the best performing regression model remains so all 10 variables go in the model to start and then when you get the output data say one of the variables has a p value of 0.9 which is high that's then removed from the uh regression model so now you have nine variables in the model and that continues until you're left with the best performing model so what model uh was uh was able to best explain more of the variance in egfr and that's what we're looking at here so the combination of sardines my sardine intake my beef intake and my total vegetable intake was able to explain 70 of the adjusted r squared of the variability in egfr so higher intake of sardines and vegetables and a lower intake of beef is correlated with a higher gfr and again higher g gfr being found in youth obviously being a good thing and we can see the significance of that model the significance f has a p-value lower than 0.05 which means that the combination of these three foods or food groups is significantly correlated with egfr now interestingly uh for fish fish has been and there's there aren't very many studies on this if anybody's got some studies on fish the correlation between fish intake and kidney function please send them over because i scoured the literature looking for that data and uh there are very few studies that have investigated it nonetheless i did find one of these studies where a higher fish intake was correlated with a higher egfr and that's what we see here in the uh plot so investigating further uh i mentioned that i also have macronutrient data starting from 2015 so i have a lot more data for that with more blood tests so which vegetable fish or beef components are affecting kidney function or at least correlated with kid function so uh that's what we see here um and my fiber intake my daily fiber intake my average daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids and protein are significantly correlated with egfr and note first that i've got you know the observations column is arrowed so i have this is data for 28 blood tests and what we can see is that a higher intake of fiber and omega-3 but a lower intake of protein is correlated with a higher egfr but also note that the adjusted r squared is obviously lower in this case it's 40 of the variability in egfr can be explained by my protein intake fiber and omega-3s which isn't surprising because you know i'm attempting to reduce my food intake to macronutrients whereas foods uh you know have way more than you know just these nutrients nonetheless 40 of their variability in egfr with just these three macronutrients is a significant amount all right so how how could fiber be related to egfr so fiber is fermented by gut bacteria to produce short chain fatty acids scfas and that's what we see here in the left picture so uh carbohydrates that escape absorption in the small intestine pass into the large intestine where they're then fermented by gut bacteria into the short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate which i've got boxed direct rectangle so why is butyrate important well as shown here the higher the levels of butyrate in stool samples which would be produced by gut bacteria because gut bacteria are in stool the higher the concentration of butyrate or butyric acid the higher the egfr so with this in mind this suggests that a higher fiber intake there would be an increased gut bacterial production of butyrate and better kidney function so that's all i've got for now uh thanks for thanks for watching if you made it to the end and have a great day
