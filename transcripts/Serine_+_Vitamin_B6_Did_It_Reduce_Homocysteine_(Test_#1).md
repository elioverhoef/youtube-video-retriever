# Serine + Vitamin B6: Did It Reduce Homocysteine? (Test #1)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In terms of longevity in an earlier video we saw that serine plus vitamin b6 may be the best way to reduce homocysteine so let's take a look at why that may be the case so starting with dietary folic acid that will be converted into serum levels of folate which in combination with vitamin b12 will convert homocysteine into methionine thereby reducing the circulating homocysteine concentration similarly betaine or trimethylglycine will also convert homocysteine into methionine but in increased methionine metabolism may be bad for longevity based on studies and animal models of methionine restriction and if you miss that data the video will be in the right corner in contrast adding serine plus vitamin b6 will convert homocysteine into cystothionine which in combination with vitamin b6 will then convert since the thinine into cysteine which can be incorporated into glutathione gsh and there are a couple of videos on this channel why glutathione restoration as it declines during aging may be beneficial not just for health but potentially longevity and if you miss those videos those will also be in the right corner so with that in mind for blood test number three in 2023 did serine and more specifically two grams of serine per day and vitamin b6 11 milligrams per day and note that that 11 milligrams per day was about three and a half times higher than my previous average of three milligrams per day did that combination reduce homocysteine so for test number two homocysteine was 11.1 micromolar and for test number three it was a little bit better at 10.1 micromolar so is this progress or just normal variation and the reason i raised that issue is because when we see how my homocysteine levels have changed during aging it may just be normal variation so let's take a little bit of a deeper look at that so i had 32 blood tests for homocysteine since 2005 and we can see that when putting that line at 10 micromolar i've had several recent values too of homocysteine at about 10 micromolar without additional b6 b12 or folate so from these data it's possible that 10.1 micromolar could just be normal variation so it's hard to say if this was progress or just normal variation now in an upcoming video we'll see that the combination of serine plus vitamin b6 did not have a major impact on any of my my other blood biomarkers so with that in mind for blood test number four in 2023 which will be in june sometime in mid to late june will further increasing serine and vitamin b6 so i intend on doubling my serine intake to 4 grams per day and tripling my b6 intake to 30 milligrams per day 10x higher than where i started at about three milligrams per day will that combination reduce homocysteine so if you're interested in that video check it out at some time in late june early july all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other discount links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
