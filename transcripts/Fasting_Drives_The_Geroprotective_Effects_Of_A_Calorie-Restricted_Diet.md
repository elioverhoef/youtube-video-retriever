# Fasting Drives The Geroprotective Effects Of A Calorie-Restricted Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Calorie restricted mice eat all of their daily calories within the first two hours after getting their food which is essentially one meal a day or omad and then fast for the next 22 hours until the next day when the food is again provided so with that in mind does fasting impact the health and lifespan extending effects of calorie restriction or cr so a paper was published earlier this week that sought to address that question and they showed that fasting drives the metabolic molecular and geoprotective effects of a calorie restricted diet in mice so what was the study approach now there's a lot of data in this paper so i'm only going to focus on the data that directly relates to longevity so this is uh they started the study in four-month-old male mice and then there were three groups an ad lib group or ad libidum which means that the mice had free access to eating as much food whenever they whenever they wanted and then classical cr in which uh the set the second group ate 30 of the calorie intake when compared to the ad-lib group and then a third group or diluted ad-lib which they diluted the diet with cellulose which reduced overall calorie density and then resulted in a 30 calorie restriction but these mice were able to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted but yet still have a 30 cr which is what is shown here so on the y axis we're looking at food consumption fc in kilocalories per day plotted against age which goes all the way up to 850 days of age so first looking at the ad-lib diet we can say that they consumed about 12 kilocalories per day now for both the cr and the diluted ad lib which ended up having about a 30 cr effect we can see that their intake is about eight and a half uh kilocalories per day and again it's about a thirty percent cr for the diluted ad lib group and the calorie restricted group so with that in mind what was the effect of cr with and without fastening on body composition glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity frailty and lifespan so first body body composition and i've got this uh titled as 30 cr one meal a day or pretty close to one meal a day versus not one meal a day or the deluded ad libitum group now note that each group spent 13 months on each diet each respective diet so first uh note that we're looking from left to right with uh we're looking at body weight lean mass fat mass whole body lean mass whole body fat mass and uh body fat percentage adiposity plotted against age of the mice on the x axis and starting with the add the bettum intake we can see that they had the highest body weight uh when compared with the other two groups and they had age-related increases in body weight an age-related increase in lean mass fat mass and they had a higher body fat percentage at the end of the 510 days so what about cr so we can see that body weight was more stable and was significantly lower when compared with the ad lib group the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted they had pretty stable amounts of whole body lean mass a small but significant increase in fat mass over time and then a small but also significant increase in whole body fat mass but about half the whole body fat uh body fat percentage of the ad lib fed mice after the 510 days so what about the diluted ad lib group which was also 30 cr but was not fasted like classical cr so we can see that their body weight was lower when compared with classic cr so 22 hour fast their uh their lean mass was also lower starting at nine months of age the diluted ad lib group had a lower lean mass when compared with the one meal a day calorie restricted mice but they also had lower fat mass when compared with the 30 cr one meal a day and then overall body fat percentage was lower in the calorie restriction group that did not fast as much or as often as the calorie restriction one meal one meal a day so that would suggest that uh calorie restriction but without fasting may be better for overall body composition than calorie restriction with a prolonged fast all day so is calorie restriction without fasting healthier than calorie restriction plus one meal a day so to uh help us address that uh these authors of this study looked at effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity between the three groups so first starting with a glucose tolerance test gtt so in this case glucose is infused and then the disappearance of blood levels of glucose over time are assessed and then the area under the curve a you see on the y axis is uh is recorded so again we've got the three groups ad lib and white diluted ad lib which is the 30 cr without fasting in blue and then calorie restriction with an all day fast in black and what we can see is that the greatest glucose tolerance was found for the mice that had dilute that consumed the diluted ad lib diet in other words 30 cr without fasting had a greater ability to remove glucose from the blood after a glucose infusion and that was even better than classical cr with a 22 hour fast which although cr with the 22 hour fast had a better glucose tolerance than the adlib mice so the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted their glucose tolerance wasn't as good as the mice that had had 30 cr but with less fasting so again this suggests that the uh 30 cr but with less fasting may be better than cr plus an all day fast now in contrast an insulin tolerance test itt was also performed and in this case insulin is injected and then the rate of disappearance from of glucose from the blood is recorded and the area under the curve auc is also recorded and in this case we can see that the 30 cr group with an all-day fast had the best insulin uh insulin sensitivity which this test is a measure of insulin sensitivity and the 30 cr group that did not fast all day did not have a significant difference for its insulin sensitivity when compared with the ad lib group so this suggests that the s all day see all day fast plus 30 cr is better for insulin sensitivity than not fasting all day for the same amount of calories so metabolic effects are interesting but does fasting or less fasting while on cr affect physiological function and to assess that the authors of the study looked at effects on frailty so we're looking at the fi which is the frailty intake index and in the study they uh presented data for six frailty related measures and as we'll see in a minute they also looked at an overall frailty score which included 25 measures so these six royalty measures included body composition overall grip strength kyphosis which has to do with how much curvature is found in the spine distension of the abdomen uh coat condition so the condition of the fur and then the loss of fur color so first what we can see is that age mice on 30 cr and one meal a day so an all-day fast have lower frailty for most measures when compared with the ad the better fed mice or mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted so in terms of body comp uh body condition grip strength uh uh and uh co condition and loss of fur color the cat restricted mice that were fasted for all day were better had a lower frailty compared to the ad-lib fed mice so what about 30 cr but not fasted and uh first we can see that there was no difference in frailty when comparing 30 cr fasting plus not or not fasting for body condition for grip strength or distension of the abdomen but then 30 cr without fasting had a worse kyphosis a worse co-condition and a greater loss of fur color when compared with the cr mice that were fasted all day so what about total frailty so first we can see that the cow restricted mice that fasted for all day about a 22-hour fast had the least amount of frailty for for the three groups but then the the 30 cr uh mice that were less fasted were just as frail as the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted but weren't cr so this suggests that cr plus an all-day fast is better for effects on uh limiting frailty during aging when compared with the same amount of calories but not fasting so what's the effect of cr with and without fasting on lifespan so here we're looking at the survival curves uh survival plotted on the y-axis against age of the mice on the x-axis and 50 survival which i've indicated there is the time when half of the mice in the colony are alive and half are dead so what we can see when compared with the ad lib the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they want whenever they wanted but when compared with their lifespan the calorie-restricted mice that were fed one meal a day or essentially one meal a day all-day fasting had the longest average lifespan conversely the mice that were fed 30 cr but could eat it whenever they wanted throughout the day so the elimination of fasting had the shortest average lifespan not just with respect to the ad lib lifespan but even shorter when compared with the same amount of calories but uh that were not fasted so the cr group so the diluted ad lib group had the shortest lifespan compared to all the other groups so that suggests that without fasting mice on 30 cr have a shortened lifespan when compared with uh the same amount of calories but an all-day fast and with ad-lib mice mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted so in sum fasting is required for cr calorie restriction induced improvements for frailty and lifespan in male c57 black 6j mice all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buy biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a
