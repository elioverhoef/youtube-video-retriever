# Dietary Fiber And SCFAs Are Relatively Higher in Centenarians-A Pathway To Longevity?

## Transcript

In this recently published paper a potential impact for dietary fiber on the gut longevity axis was identified so let's jump right into the data so first there was the lrc group which was defined as centenarians from a longevus region and these people had an average age of 103 years and in the second group there was the lre group which were elderly from a longevus region 2 and in that group the average age was 63 years so then the next obvious question should be what's a longevist region so the united nations defines a longevus region as having 7.5 centenarians per 100 000 people so then the next question should be where is this long longevus region and what is its centenarian rate so it's found in china and more specifically within bama county in the guangzhi province and there they had 43 centenarians per 100 000 people which is five to six times a greater rate than the u.n definition for a longevus region all right so then returning to the baseline characteristics there were 30 centenarians and then there were 31 elderly so a total study of 61 people relatively small study and then they had relatively similar bmis of 24 the centenarians 20.8 in the elder elderly so then what was the potential impact for dietary fiber on the gut longevity axis so fecal short chain fatty acids scfas were higher in the centenarians when compared with the 63 year olds and that's what we can see here so we've got the concentration of various short chain fatty acids going from the two carbon acetic acid up to the five carbon valeric acid so we've got those there on the x-axis and then our for our two groups in red slash orange we've got the centenarians and in purple we've got the elderly or the 63 year olds so then we can see for the three primary short chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate in terms of abundance these these are the major fat short chain fatty acids in terms of being most abundant we can see that they were significantly increased in the centenarians when compared with the 63 year olds also significant increases for relatively smaller abundant short chain fatty acids including isobutyrate and valerate were also found in the centenarians such that the total short chain fatty acids total levels in fecal samples were higher in the centenarians when compared with the 63 year olds so how are fecal short chain fatty acids scfas related to diet so short chain fatty acids are produced by soluble fiber fermentation and it's important to note soluble fiber because insoluble fiber is not fermented by gut bacteria to make short chain fatty acids so we can see that illustrated here here so soluble dietary fiber is fermented by gut microbiota or gut bacteria into the three primary short chain fatty acids in terms of abundance acetate propionate and butyrate so then the next question is was dietary fiber higher uh was dietary fiber intake higher in centenarians when compared with the younger age group and it was and that's what we can see here so nutrient intakes on the y-axis and then we've got protein fat carbohydrate and dietary fiber content when comparing the centenarians again in red slash orange versus the 63 year olds in purple and what we can see is that the centenarians had a significantly higher dietary fiber intake now interestingly the 63 year olds had an increased a significantly increased carbohydrate intake when compared with the centenarians and that's important because an increased carbohydrate intake without a higher fiber intake suggests that the diet overall diet quality in the centenarians may have been better than the 63 year olds and it's important that fruits and vegetables which are abundant in soluble fiber have carbohydrates so you'd expect a higher carb diet would have a higher level of dietary fiber now i'm not here to say dietary fiber dietary carbohydrate should be higher or lower in the diet i prefer the biomarkers tell the story but at least in this study it's possible that the dietary quality was better in the centenarians in addition to having a higher dietary fiber content also note that levels of protein and fat were not different when comparing the centenarians with the 63 year olds so besides looking at group based differences for fiber intake and short chain fatty acids dietary fiber intake was also significantly correlated with levels of fecal short chain fatty acids when looking at the total study cohort or the 61 people and we can see that here so here we're looking at correlations between dietary fiber intake with short chain fatty acids and feces and then on the left we've got r and p and if you are familiar with this channel those should not be foreign letters as the r is a correlation coefficient and p is the p-value with less than 0. 0.05 being a statistically significant correlation and what we can see is that relatively higher dietary fiber intakes were significantly correlated with the three primary short chain fatty acids in terms of their abundance in feces acetate propionate and butyrate and also there was a significant correlation for valeric acid or valerate such that the total level of short chain fatty acids was significantly correlated with a relatively higher dietary fiber intake so in other words the higher the dietary fiber intake that was significantly correlated with each of these short chain fatty acids and the total amount of short chain fatty acids in stool so that then raises the hypothesis if we increase dietary fiber intake that should increase fecal short chain fatty acids and then is that an approach for reaching centenarian status now everything presented in this data was correlation but could this be a causative pathway involved in longevity these data based on the correlation may be yes all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links
