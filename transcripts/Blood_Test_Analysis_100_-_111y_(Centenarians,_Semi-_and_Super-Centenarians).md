# Blood Test Analysis: 100 - 111y (Centenarians, Semi- and Super-Centenarians)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video i went over the blood test data for a hundred-year-old centenarian subject now a valid criticism of that video was that her data may not have been representative of other centenarians so i scoured literature and looked for uh big studies in terms of uh sample sizes that have studied centenarians so that's what i'm going to go over today so in terms of how many centenarians uh uh data we're gonna look at uh so it's 275 centenarians that's 100 to 104 years old 387 semi-cetenarians that's that were 105 to 109 years old and then 22 people super centenarians who lived older than 110 years but then also as control groups there were 536 community dwelling older adults that were 85 to 99 years and then 334 centenarian offspring and their spouses that were about 75 years so a pretty nice age distribution for for 75 to over 110 year uh old subjects in contrast most studies are only studying up to about 80 so we're going to look at blood test data today past that limit so uh let's have a look at the data blood test data for subjects 75 to 110 years old so there's a lot of data here let's just unpack it very slowly so first in the left two columns we've got data for the family of centenarians uh in the left column are the offspring of centenarians and as you can see the distribution of men to women was more men than women and then in the next column unrelated family these were the spouses of the offspring and you can see it's exactly the opposite so less men and more women and the age groups of these two columns are in the around the mid 70s and then we've got very old subjects who are unrelated to the centenarians or their offspring uh with a age range of 85 to 99 years and an average age of about 87. So then the centenarians so the average uh uh centenarian a hundred to 104 years old uh their average um uh age there was a about 101 years old so the semi centenarians uh 105 to 109 years old average age of about 107 years old in that group and then the 110 year old the super centenarians only 22 subjects in the group but with an average age of 111 years so just before getting into the blood test data i just want to highlight an important point here so if you look at the age uh the gender uh distribution of of the centenarian groups so when looking at the 100 204 year old group about 21 out of every 100 centenarians were men so uh eight out of ten are women and only about two out of ten are men so the probability of getting to a hundred is far far better if you're a woman than a man uh so that uh probability gets worse as the age groups uh go up in age so for the 105 to 109 year old group only 12 out of every 100 subjects were men and 88 would be women so uh far better odds of getting to the extreme ages if you're a woman which again is verified by the super centenarians where only nine out of uh every hundred super centenarians were men with 91 being women so if you're a woman who's got longevity genes congratulations i don't i'm gonna have to science the sh out of aging to get there and uh by studying blood test data and diet and all the ways that i do it uh that's uh how i anticipate getting there if i can so let's have a look at all of this blood test data so first uh some of this is going to be a review i've uh uh published some of this data in other videos that i'll link in the right corner uh so i'm kind of gonna i'd like to fly through some of this where i've already uh discussed it uh for those of you haven't seen it uh welcome all right so white blood cells so that's what i've got highlighted here we can see that it's in the mostly uh in the uh 5500 to 6000 range for all of the age groups with the exception of the super centenarians where we've got 6 300 around 6 300 white blood cells per microliter so how does it change with age and then um what's what's optimal alright so first in terms of the reference range that isn't going to tell you what's optimal because it's right within the reference range uh perhaps the strongest data for white blood cells with uh aging comes from the baltimore longitudinal study on aging where uh subjects came in repeatedly uh up to about 40 years so baseline visit they kept coming in for up to 40 years so the same subjects have data tracked for a long period of time relative to cross-sectional studies where you're just looking at groups separate groups which is important but not as strong as longitudinal data so what we can see is uh white blood cell counts uh in different uh amounts so less than 3 500 3 500 to 6 000 6 000 and 1 to 10 000 and then greater than 10 000 so what's optimal so uh we can look at average life expectancy at 50 survival the the time when half of the cohort has died or half is still alive and uh what we can see is that uh so for the 3 500 to 6 000 group the average life expectancy uh when compared with baseline is about 38 years so i've got that uh highlighted with the red lines uh on the x-axis so in comparison having higher than six thousand six thousand to ten thousand the average life expectancy was only thirty years so an eight year increase in lifespan or life expectancy sorry for those who had 3 500 to 6 000 and even though those are both within the reference range it's pretty clear that having 3 500 6 000 would be better for life expectancy so uh in contrast having more than ten thousand that's an error there should have fixed that not less than having more than ten thousand the life expectancy was only 25 years so uh 3 500 6 000 is optimal and then when looking in the sentence and data this is pretty good they're right within that range with the exception of the super centenarians who kind of get a little bit above it but that's not too high now i should mention that white blood cells are all not all created equal they're mostly comprised of neutrophils and lymphocytes and i won't go into that data today but um neutrophils go up with age and lythocytes go down so that's that's going to be a topic for another video so so far in terms of white blood cells centenarians uh and their offspring and spouses of the offspring and community dwellers 85 to 99 years old not not doing too badly all right red blood cells and hemoglobin some of this data have already gone over but some of it i have not so uh white blood cells first uh you can see starting from the left side and going to the right they decrease from about 4.44 and uh getting to the uh less than four three six two three point six one three point seven seven so they decrease during aging there now hemoglobin which carries oxygen is found within red blood cells so if your red blood cells are decreasing during aging so is your hemoglobin or or your hemoglobin levels and that's exactly what we see here from values of 13.8 and 13.3 in the 70 year old 70th year olds to in the low to mid 11's in the centenarians uh so the rep you know the reference range uh there for red blood cells they'd be out of the reference range and for hemoglobin they'd also be out of the reference range but that doesn't tell you much so first how did the red blood cells change with age i've shown this in another video and this just verifies the data for the centenarians or the decrease with aging that we see from the centenarian offspring going towards centenarians so red blood cells decrease from values of around 4.8 and 4.3 and men and women respectively down to about 3.9 in 90 ish year olds which again we see a similar trend in the centenarians so uh what about mortality risk so here's uh all-cause mortality risk or risk of death for all causes uh for levels of hemoglobin uh in the left for men and on the right for women so uh when considering that most of the centenary and offspring were men values around 13.8 aren't too bad uh you know they it in terms of the values and the all-cause mortality plot for men that be associated with an increased mortality risk but it could be worse because if it was less than 13 well so for any of the centenarians that are men they get to less than 13 with the values shown on the right and the 11's they'd be at a higher all-cause mortality risk uh in contrast the women uh for all cause mortality rates to be elevated based on hemoglobin levels they need to be less than 11. So in terms of the centenary and data that are in the 11s they're it's close it's borderline so uh i should say that based on all of this the red blood cell and hemoglobin data isn't great but uh it's also not terrible um and in the way i see it it's there's room for improvement all right platelets so um platelets here they start off uh in the 70 year olds 70 year olds 21.5 to 21.9 and i'm just going to use these in hundred units so it would be platelets times 10 to the third per microliter not 10 times 10 to the fourth so 215 219 and the 70 issue rolls and then in the centenarians we see values around 189 to 193. So there's an age-related decrease however slight it is now the reference range doesn't tell you anything about that because it's within range however platelets decrease with aging and that's what i've shown here by the red arrows in this plot so this is a relatively big study of more than uh 500 000 subjects and what we can see is based on you know with the age groups uh from 20 to 90 to 100 years old uh platelets decrease in the men from values around 230 to around 210 and then and then in women from around 260 to around 240. So we actually have a greater decrease here right because we get into the 190s which isn't reflected by uh this age-related data so it's a little worse than what's been published now what about all cost mortality risk so we're looking at that data here in a study of 131 plus subjects so platelet values and i've got it highlighted with the arrow that are in the 200 to 300 range are associated with lowest risk of death for all causes and risk of death for all causes increases as you go below 200 and even worse having less than 100 you can see the risk is 93 increase relative to the 8 increase uh for 100 to 200 platelets and also ver for very high platelet levels 300 to 400 there's also an increased risk of mortality so for the platelets this also isn't terrible they're barely below 200 um so not so bad it could be far worse they could have had less than 100 platelets based on the all-cause mortality data all right total cholesterol and i've done a a video on this too so check it out if you're interested um so i'm just going to go through it real quick so uh there you can see the total cholesterol levels from the seven-year-olds uh from 80 88 year old group so values around 200 to 210 that then decrease uh into you know from 172 to 165 156 in the centenarians and as i showed in that video uh total cholesterol levels increase during aging and then decrease so this data in the centenarians and their offspring and the other age groups just verifies that and then in terms of mortality risk um so at the younger ages less than 100 they'd be close to optimal as i've got highlighted here with the black lines but then we can see the centenarian groups with the trend towards very uh or lower values that they would be starting to increase their more alcohols from all cores all cause mortality risk based on their cholesterol data what about hdl so i haven't shown this data before let's have a look at it so for hdl there wasn't much of an age-related decrease until about 105 years old so values in the 50s for the younger than 105 year old age groups but then you can see at the 105 210 year old groups 45 and 44 respectively so fortunately though having lower cholesterol levels or at least hdl cholesterol levels in these ranges are not associated with dramatic increases in all-cause mortality risk so this is data on hdl and risk of death from cardiovascular related issues so cb death cancer death and then other deaths so there are three columns there and then for it with for the plot uh in men um so starting off in the 50s which what the age the younger age groups had hdl levels uh in the 50s so for any men in the younger age groups that had hdl values in the 50s reducing that to the 40s there's no significant increase in risk of death for all causes however for the women having values in the 50s that drop to the 40s there's an increase in risk for death from cv related issues and other deaths however the increase is small it's a small increase relative to having hdl levels in the 30s which um that's not what the average values here were in the older uh the semi and the super centenarian group so hdl not not bad all right albumin and i'd argue that albumin may be the most underrated biomarker uh uh that exists i mean um most people think about glucose and inflammation uh there are several biological age calculators that seem to always pay you know come up with uh albumin um as one of their most important biological age predictors so i've shown this in another video and uh let's have a look at their data so albumin levels from the younger age groups values around 4.2 4.2 that decrease uh all the way up to the semi-super sorry the super centenarians to values around 3.2 now in terms of the reference range so they barely get out of the reference range and um how does it change during aging so um we can see that albumin levels decrease with age that's what i've shown here in a study of more than a million subjects and if we would look at where the data starts for the youngest age group the people in the 70s and then the centenarians and beyond we can see that they're just on the age-related decrease you know the decrease for albumin with age that there isn't anything special going on here other than following the trend like this study of a million subjects and then in terms of all-cause mortality risk having higher levels of abdomen are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk so in for men having values greater than 4.5 and then in women values greater than 4.4 are associated with lowest risk of death for all causes so anything lower than those values is associated with higher mortality risk regardless of age at younger ages and in older ages and you can see that data here for both the men and the women so their abdomen level isn't great now what's important is that abdomen levels from my experience are malleable you can you can alter it with diet so i'd like to see some studies in very old uh subjects semi and super centenarians that try to you know alter their diet with the goal of improving their abdomen levels all right kidney function so let's have a look at that and one way to look at that is by looking at their creatinine levels and that's what we see here so based on our creatinine levels even though there is a small increase and then decrease throughout the groups during aging uh because creatinine levels increase during aging we'd expect to see very high levels of creatinine in the oldest old but that's not what we see here so um and if you just look at the reference range they're pretty much within range there's nothing to be worried about all-cause mortality data a similar story we can see that the lowest risk of death raw causes has been reported in the 0.6 to 1.1 milligram per deciliter range for creatinine and they'd be just you know around the lowest risk there now there may be something going on going on here though and what i mean by that is creatinine levels are correlated with muscle mass now whereas creatinine levels uh increase on their on their own independent of muscle mass when you have a decrease in muscle mass you're going to have a decrease in creatinine so you've got the age-related creatinine increases related to decreased kidney function but then you've also got a decrease in muscle mass and creatinine is stored within muscle or a large portion of it is stored within muscle so you have an age-related increase because of decreased kidney function but then you have decreased muscle mass which would decrease creatinine levels so that the effect um may be you know washed out here in terms of one thing's going up one thing's going down so you really don't see any change in it um so i'd argue other measures of kidney function uh should probably be investigated in in each of these subjects to further get at the what's going on with kidney function all right and then inflammation and and you know i i shouldn't have to emphasize this too much but everybody pretty much knows inflammation goes up with age and it's bad for health let's just take a relatively quick look at the data here though so they looked at c-reactive proteins crp interleukin-6 il-6 and tnf-alpha and what you can see uh for each of these inflammatory markers is they all increased uh during aging from the 70 year olds to the super centenarians 111 years old so i've gone over crp in another video i'll link to that in the right corner let's have a look at the other data io-6 and tnf-alpha so first in a meta-analysis of nine il-6 studies this just shows that having higher il-6 and i've rectangled that on the bottom so there's a 49 increase with having in all-cause mortality risk with higher il-6 values compared to lower values so just verifying that having higher il-6 during aging is not good now in contrast the data for tnf alpha is a little bit more variable than the crp and il6 data so first and then age-related increases for crp and il-6 but not tnf-alpha were found in the first study and then higher il-6 and crp were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in the next study but not tnf alpha so the first two inflammatory markers increases uh all caused more mortality risk in the second study but no association for tnf alpha with mortality risk in that study and then there is data that shows uh an increased all-cause mortality risk for tnf alpha but that was shown only in men but not women in the last study here so um crp and il-6 i'd argue more established markers of age-related uh inflammation in tnf alpha and then last but not least cytomegalovirus um so it's it's a virus and it's if you look at the data here it's up in every group and not just up um if you look at the percentage here in each group so starting in the seven-year-old so 97.6 percent of the first group 99.4 98.1 percent 99.6 and then the semi and super centenarians all had cm v infection either active or previous now there's so much emphasis on coronavirus and you know uh uh there should be because it's you know instantaneous you can be dead in a month whereas cmv can uh sit late for decades but uh cmv deserves its own video but just just briefly introduce cnv to everybody i should say it's it's one of the herpes viruses it's hv5 so that's cytomegalovirus it increases during aging that's what i've shown here so starting off in kids six to 11 years old the um prevalence of them being effect infected with cnv 36 and then if you go down each age group you can see that in adults older than 80 in this study around 91 percent had been infected or were currently affected with cmv so this data here in the older than 80 age groups we can see it's even more than 90 it it's you know if you live long enough we're all gonna get it um and then as an interesting uh brief story it ties in potentially to the nad story so in this study here they found that infecting endothelial cells in this case human umbilical vein endothelial cells qvex cells infecting those cells with cmv resulted in significantly decreased certain one protein levels so uh certain one is a uh you know anti-aging protein so having less of it would be bad for aging and i'm probably going to talk more about cmv cert t1 and the other effects of cmb on aging in another video so stay tuned for that all right if you made it to the end thanks a lot and that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
