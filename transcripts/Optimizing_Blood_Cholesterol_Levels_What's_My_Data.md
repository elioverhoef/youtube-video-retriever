# Optimizing Blood Cholesterol Levels: What's My Data?

## Transcript

In my previous video i presented data for the association between total cholesterol levels and blood with all cost mortality risk i blood test four to six times per year so what does my data look like in terms of total cholesterol so here we see that data on the y-axis we've got total cholesterol in milligrams per deciliter plotted against time each blue point corresponds to a value total cholesterol value for a given date so my average total cholesterol during that period is 145 milligrams per deciliter so how does that uh what does that put me in terms of uh mortality risk so here's that data and we're looking at mortality risk for 45 to 54 year olds i'm currently 47 years old chronologically and based on 145 value that would put me at about 60 higher uh at a 60 higher risk of death for all causes when compared with someone with higher cholesterol levels in this case around 220. So with that with that information i should probably alter my diet uh which should increase my blood cholesterol levels and potentially uh that should reduce my all-cause mortality risk so which dietary factors are most strongly correlated with my total cholesterol levels in blood so 2015 i haven't just tracked my uh blood test results i've also tracked my diet so i weigh all my food and then log that intake into an online app which tells me my macro and micronutrients uh that i consumed on that day so i've been doing that since 2015. So for each blood test i have an average dietary intake that corresponds to that blood test so for example if i us do a blood test on january 1st uh january 2nd starts the dietary period for my next blood test so if i blood test on march 1st so january 2nd to february 28th or 29th depending if it's on in a leap year i can take the average dietary intake from january 2nd to february 29th and that data would correspond to the blood test then on march 1st so with enough average dietary periods that correspond with blood test results i can start to look for correlations between my diet with my blood tests and that's exactly what i do so um what i found was that my plasma levels of cholesterol are most strongly correlated with my saturated fat intake so that's what's plotted here total cholesterol in milligrams per deciliter on the y-axis against my saturated my average saturated fat intake in grams per day and we can see that the correlation is very strong in this case it's 0.87 so a correlation of 1 in this case is perfectly linear that's as good as it gets so having a correlation of 0.87 is a very strong correlation uh and we can it's a significant correlation too statistically significant we can see that by the p-value of 2.2 times 10 to the negative 8. So what this means is is that the higher my saturated fat intake the higher my total cholesterol levels in blood and at the high end of this range my saturated fat intake being around 50 grams per day the highest cholesterol level that i've attained in the last five years is around 180 so this would suggest that i should go even higher if i want to get my cholesterol levels to around 220 which was associated with lowest risk of death for all causes for my age group so but then we've got the biohacker's dilemma if i improve one variable do i make two others worse so in this case those two variables one of them is uh glucose so we're looking at here is the correlation between my total cholesterol levels with my plasma glucose levels on the x-axis and it isn't a strong correlation it's a moderately strong correlation less strong than the saturated fat data but it's a significant correlation as indicated by the p-value with the correlation coefficient of 0.58 and what that means is that as my cholesterol levels increase so do my plasma glucose levels and i'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute similarly uh higher total cholesterol is also associated with higher levels of plasma creatinine for me and again this is also a moderately strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.61 and it's again statistically significant as you can see by the p-value so um it's also important to note that these are univariate associations meaning the correlation between glucose with total cholesterol or creatinine against total cholesterol it's one variable uh in its correlation against another variable it's called univariate now i can look at the combined correlation between glucose and creatinine against total cholesterol and what does that result in so when i when i put those two in a model the correlation is then 0.7 which is now getting towards a pretty strong correlation and it's also interesting to note that the um percentage of the variance the r squared that is explained uh by glucose and creatinine the sorry the percentage of the variance in total cholesterol that's explained by glucose and creatinine it's 40 about 49 percent that's what the r squared is uh indicating so almost half of the variability in cholesterol is explained by these two other plasma biomarkers thereby illustrating a big chunk you know of cholesterol is explained by just two biomarkers i think that's important data so can i derive a total cholesterol optimal range based on also optimizing these two biomarkers so in a previous video on glucose i presented data in terms of what's optimal for all-cause mortality risk and how it changes with age so briefly glucose levels between 80 and 94 milligram milligrams for deciliter is associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk values around 85 are associated with biological youth so i'd prefer to get somewhere in the 85 to 90 range or even as close as i can to 80 even though that's unlikely based on these data as you can see i've only hit values close to 80 twice in the last five years out of about 25 blood tests so that's unlikely what's more likely for me is i can get somewhere in the 85 to 90 range so um assuming i can get closer to 80 though the total cholesterol range that would potentially optimize my glucose values is between 130 to 160 milligrams per deciliter so what about for creatinine now i also have a video on creatinine check that out if you're interested but creatinine levels increase with age which uh creatinine is basically a measure of kidney function so higher creatinine indicates worse kidney function with age so it lower is is better for creatinine and also uh values all cause mortality values uh for creatinine or optimal around 0.8 milligrams per deciliter so uh somewhere around 0.8 would be great but again based on my data you can see i only hit somewhere around that 0.8 range twice out of 24 or 25 blood tests here so what's more likely is somewhere in the 0.9 to 1.0 range my average creatinine value during that five year period is 0.92 so i'd be happier with that rather than some of the higher values uh that you can see you know towards 1.1 even which is going in the wrong direction that's indeed indicative of a worse kidney function so uh to get in that 0.85 to around one range the total cl my total cholesterol levels uh would potentially need to be in the 130 to around 150 range so somewhere in the 130 to 150 160 range may optimize both glucose and creatinine but it may be bad for all cause mortality risk because if you remember on the earlier slide values in the 130 to 160 range were associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk so there isn't a happy ending to the story i just wanted to illustrate that when it comes to optimizing blood biomarkers sometimes it may be important to win as many battles as you can and not lose as many battles it may not be possible to simultaneously optimize everything but it may be possible to sign you know to optimize eight things and two things are not optimized that may be as good as it can get so uh i'm gonna keep at it and see if i can uh you know somehow optimize all three but for now this is where we are it's all i've got you can find me a lot of places online have a great day
