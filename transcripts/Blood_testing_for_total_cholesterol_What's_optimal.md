Total cholesterol blood test what's optimal so to adjust that question first let's have a look at how levels of total cholesterol change during aging so what we're looking at here is data for almost 13 million subjects with total cholesterol levels plotted on the y-axis against age and entry on the x-axis so first we can see that lower levels of total cholesterol are found in youth values around 170 for women and 160 for men are found in 18 year olds well then cholesterol levels increase during aging so for women the 170 goes up to about 210 at about 50 with a peak at about 56 years of age whereas in men it goes from 160 to about 200 and at around 48 to 50 years of age and then after those ages cholesterol levels total cholesterol levels decline towards the end of life so what about risk of death for all causes so using data from the same study we can see that there's a u-shaped association for the association between total cholesterol levels with all cause mortality risk so risk of death for all causes including cardiovascular disease cancer respiratory diseases all of them combined in lowest risk of death for all causes as highlighted here by the red arrows is found for total cholesterol levels between 210 to 249 milligrams per deciliter now also notice that risk of death increases at levels lower than that at all levels lower than that and risk of death for all causes a cm increases above 249 so but also interestingly know that having levels less than about 140 and women and about 150 and men the risk of death for all causes for cholesterol levels lower than that is actually higher than having very high levels of cholesterol even at up to 300 so that data just illustrates the that lower cholesterol is potentially not better than having higher cholesterol so based on this data should 210 to 249 be considered optimal well it's important to note that in this study there was a very wide age distribution that a ton of subjects and i've highlighted the age distribution here and you can see that there are millions of subjects for every age distribution with the exception of the older ages above 65 but even over from 65 to 99 it's about 1.3 million subjects so that's still a ton of data so is 210 to 249 associated with the lowest all cause mortality mortality risk for all of the age groups let's have a look at the data so i'm gonna show the data starting from the oldest age groups and work work backwards so first 210 to 249 is associated with the lowest risk of death for all causes in people men and women seventy five to ninety nine years of age now notice here that this curve is more flat than the cars were about to see but again also notice that lower values in this case below around 140 seem to have a higher risk of death for all causes compared with the very high levels you know 280 300 etc all right what about younger than 75 so a similar similar trend again 210 to 249 is was associated with the lowest risk for both men and women and again increasing risk of death for all causes with lower and also higher levels of total cholesterol what about in adults younger than 65 years again similar trend 210 to 249 optimal lower cholesterol seems to have a higher risk than higher cholesterol nonetheless higher risk at both low and high levels of total cholesterol relative to 210 to 249 and again 45 to 54 similar trend now where the data gets a little more interesting is in the younger age group so 35 to 44 years let's start there so the 210 to 249 that was optimal at the older age groups is not optimal at 35 to 44 year age group so for the women 180 to 220 was associated with the lowest risk of death for all causeless and then at the lower levels of cholesterol risk increases only significantly for levels that are 131 39 and less than 120 and risk also increases for women at higher levels greater than 280 but also notice in this case at younger age group that having lower levels of cholesterol less than 140 in this case doesn't seem to have in part in part a higher risk compared with greater than 280 so that's one way that the younger data diverges from the older data well what about the data for men in this age group so in this case 210 to 229 was associated with lowest risk of death for all causes and then risk increases for men at total cholesterol less than 210 and then between 2:30 and 239 and greater than 250 all right how about in the youngest age group so first lois chris that's starting with the women the data for the women the lowest risk of death for all causes was 160 to 200 and then note that there was no significant increase in all cause mortality as for values lower than 160 so lower cholesterol in women 18 to 34 years lower than 160 was not associated with an increased risk of death for all causes which is in contrast to all of the other data at the in the other age groups and once again very high values in this case greater than 280 were associated with higher risk for the 18 to 34 year old women what about the data for the men so in this case 180 to 220 is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes and then risk increases at total cholesterol levels less than 150 and then also greater than 260 so for the men in this case a u-shaped curve albeit with values that are different from the older age groups and then all the data i showed in the past few slides was a lot so to simplify it i put it at the table form so wherever your age group is you can have an easy and quick look at the data that's all i've got you can find me lots of places online have a great day
