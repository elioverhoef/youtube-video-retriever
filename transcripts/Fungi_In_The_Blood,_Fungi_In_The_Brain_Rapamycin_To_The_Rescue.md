# Fungi In The Blood, Fungi In The Brain: Rapamycin To The Rescue?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video i showed data that there's an increased incidence of e coli bloodstream infections during aging well e coli isn't the only microbe that increases during aging other microbes increase in the blood during aging too one of these is candida so during aging there's an 11 to 12 fold increased incidence of candida bloodstream infections during aging so let's have a look at the data so here we see the number of cases of candida bloodstream infections by year so in 2000 and 2001 2002 all the way through uh 2005 and the number of candida cases broken down by age group so first in looking at the youngest age group 18 to 44 years we can see that there's a 1.4 to 2.3 uh cases of candida bloodstream infections in the youngest age group now that increases during aging so for the 45 to 64 year age group we can see that there are 4.5 to 6.8 cases of candida bloodstream infections with candida per 100 000 population and that's a three-fold increase which only increases further into the 85 to 84-year age group where we can see a range of 12.5 to 18.6 cases of bloodstream infections with candida fungi per 100 100 000 population which is a eight to nine fold increase relative to the youngest age group and then in looking at the oldest age group uh older than 85 years we can see that there are 17.3 to 25 cases per 100 000 population of candida bloodstream infections uh for that age group which is an 11 to 12 fold increase relative to the youngest group so what's the significance of this age-related increase increased incidence for candida fungi in the blood well microbes in the blood potentially microbes in the brain and in this case candida albicans a species of candida is found in various brain regions in an alzheimer's disease patient so in looking at sections of different regions of the brain in this case the external frontal cortex the cerebellar hippocampus and the enter rhino cortex hippocampus and i've highlighted those regions of the brain there we can see that there are candida albicans fungi in the brain so blue stains dappy which recognizes nuclei uh red is an antibody that recognizes human neurofilament and wherever you see green are our candida albicans these uh the green are antibodies that recognize and bind to uh candida albicans and again these are in brain sections so just to highlight you can see the green there as i've highlighted by the yellow yellow stars uh and then in the cerebellar hippocampus the lots of green there and then even more green in the third slice so uh candida albicans is found in the brain of alzheimer's disease or at least one alzheimer's disease patient so data for one is good but more data is generally better so here we're looking at brain sections of the entering cortex for 10 different alzheimer's disease patients so in this case again blue stains dappy uh nuclei red is an antibody that recognizes alpha tubulin and green are antibodies that recognize uh candida albicans so wherever you see green there is fungi whenever you see wherever you see yellow there's also fungi because red plus green equals yellow so green or yellow we've got fungi in the brain so just to highlight in each of these patients because each section uh here is data for a different alzheimer's disease patient so we've got a candida there there and just to go through them all so you can see the green or yellow in each of these alzheimer's disease patients fungi in the brain now it isn't just candida albicans that's been found in the brains of alzheimer's disease patients other candida species have been found in the brain too in this case candida glabrata so uh again green recognizes uh is an antibody that recognizes candida glabrata so wherever you see green or red which in this case is stained for alpha tubulin uh sorry yellow uh green plus red equals yellow so wherever you see green or yellow we've got uh candida glabrata in the brain so i've highlighted that each of these subjects alzheimer's disease patients have either green or yellow indicating they've got candida species uh in this case glabrata in the brain so what about the control subjects do they have candida in the brain so we're looking at uh sections of the entorhinal cortex and again green is the antibody that would recognize candida glabrata so wherever there would be green or yellow because red plus green equals yellow we would have candida in the brain and as you can see from each of the 10 control subjects data for 10 control subjects for brain sections here there's no green and there's no yellow so for whatever reason uh candida is in the brain of alzheimer's disease patients and i'd argue that based on the age-related increase for candida in the blood that may be one potential explanation uh so that's not the only study that's found fungi in the in the brains of alzheimer's disease patients and i've listed just two papers here in case anyone's interested in checking that out so rapamycin to the rescue uh and why would that be so here we're looking at in vitro uh data for the ability of rapamycin to kill fungi uh rapamycin's a well-known antifungal but let's have a look at some of that data so on the first plate to the left that's a plate that does not have rapamycin so in only focusing on the wild type this is uh normal candida albicans uh the other the other uh parts of this plate are are have various candida albicans mutants i'm not going to get into that data i'm more concerned with the effect of rapamycin on the normal the full genotype normal wild type candida albicans so what's the effect of rapamycin on candida applicants we can see that in the next box here so when you add rapamycin to that dish that had candida in the right corner in the presence of rapamycin there is no uh candida albicans growth completely eliminates it so in vitro data is nice in cells but what about in animals so here in this study uh the they gave uh injections of candida albicans to mice so it's in the blood when you inject it and uh without rapamycin we can see the dose of zero survival zero so no rapamycin iv injection of candida albicans kills all the mice so what happens with increasing doses of rapamycin well survival increases and it increases to the point where the 20 milligrams per kilogram dose of rapamycin for mice that are iv injected with candida albicans there's 100 survival so rapamycin protects against uh candida in the blood and when considering the in vitro the in vitro data where it uh completely eliminates growth of candida albicans one could argue that it improves survival by basically eradicating the candida that was iv injected so from this we can conclude that rapamycin is a potent anti antifungal against candida candida albicans now if you remember the earlier slides i showed not just candida albicans fungi in the brain but candida glabrata a different species of candida that was also found on the brains of alzheimer's disease patients how does rapamycin do against that so here we're looking at that data so first uh this is uh candida glabrata growth in the presence or absence of rapamycin so first no rapamycin you can see rapamycin on the x-axis in micrograms per ml uh so when there are zero rapamycin added there is full growth of candida glabrata but as the rapamycin concentration increases in this case from five micrograms per mil to 10 micrograms per mil a candida glabrata growth is reduced maximally reduced in this case there's a four to six fold reduction for candida glabrata as rapamycin levels are increased so when considering all of these data one would hope that there are randomized controlled trials rcts that use rabbamycin to prevent or slow alzheimer's disease progression and as far as i could see and i looked there were no studies that have done that yet uh now uh there is one early phase rct uh that's using rapamycin treatment in alzheimer's disease patients but this uh study just started recruiting uh a couple months ago june 2020 so hope let's hope for positive data uh for that going forward all right that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places on online have a great day
