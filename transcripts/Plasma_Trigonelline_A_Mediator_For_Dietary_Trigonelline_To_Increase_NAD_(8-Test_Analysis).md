## Transcript

Trigonelline which is otherwise known as one methyl nicotinic acid or methylated nasin increases nad and these data will be in mice so first we're going to take a look at nad levels in whole blood and then there are three groups controls and then nad levels in whole blood 2 hours after the mice were force-fed with trigonelline and then nad levels the next day after that trigonelline force feed so first we can see that whole blood ned levels were increased 2 hours after after the trigonelline force feed but not the next day now a common criticism about blood ned level measurements or blood intracellular ned level measurements is what's happening in tissues for example what happens in blood may not be representative of changes inside of tissues like liver or muscle so they evaluated that in this study and first taking a look at liver levels of nad again 2 hours or overnight after the trigonelline force feed so first we can see that liver levels of n were significantly increased 2 hours later but were not significantly increased the next day what about in muscle and that's what we'll see here they looked at the gastrus which is the lower calf lower calf muscle so here 2 hours after the trigonelline force feed ned levels were not significantly increased but they were significally increased the next day so from these data we can see that at least in mice trigonelline uh increases ned both in whole blood and inside tissues including the liver and muscle now if you're familiar with the channel then you know i've been trying to increase nad by increasing dietary intake of tr trigonelline rich foods now another part of that equation is if trigonelline intake is high will plasma trigonelline also be high and that's potentially important because in the mouse study on the left after the trigonelline force feed plasma levels of trigonelline increased in conjunction with the increases for nad in each in each area whole blood liver and muscle so if i increase dietary trigonelline but don't see a change in plasma levels of trigonelline how can i expect at least blood levels of trigonelline of nad to increase so then there's a second question is plasma trigonelline significantly correlated with nad and i have8 tests for both blood intracellular levels of nad and plasma levels of trigonelline so first the plasma levels of trigonelline are generated by uh an atome metabolomics kit using iolo's kit and if you want to trct this yourself or it's other 600 other metabolites discount link in the video's description so what we'll see is that plasma levels of trigonelline can indeed be increased by diet so on the y-axis we've got plasma levels of trigonelline again tracked by iolo's kit so for the first five tests and this is from 2023 into 2024 data i wasn't i didn't have anything special in my diet in terms of trigonelline rich foods was just eating my normal diet and over those five tests my average plasma trigonelline level was 29 micromolar which is relatively low and then after i saw the trigonelline story i think it was on a modern health span that i was first made aware of trigonelline increasing the preliminary data it was it wasn't published yet uh dr vin vin venzo santino was on modern healthspan talking about trigonelline and then i saw the data in pre-print and then in uh maybe it was in preprint but it was finally published uh earlier this year so once i saw that that uh trigonelline could increase nad i started to add trigonelline rich foods into the approach starting with fenugreek seeds and we can see that that pushed plasma levels of trigonelline closer to one micromolar so about a 3x increase for plasma trigonelline but then there are other foods that may be more rich in trigonelline and for the test after that i included foods like chickpeas and alala sprouts which have been reported to have trigonelline there too i saw an increase for plasma trigonelline now pushing it closer to 2 micromolar about 7x higher than my baseline but the biggest jump you can see that there's a green dot in the right corner that's with clover sprouts and clover seeds have been reported to have the highest content of trigonelline relative to other foods including coffee so more specifically it incre increased plasma trigonelline to 6.9 micromolar which is a 24x increase above my baseline so from this we can see that plasma trigonelline can indeed be increased by diet but what about the correlation or the correlation for plasma trigonelline with plasma levels or blood intracellular levels of nad and here too as i mentioned earlier i have eight tests which is what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got blood intracellular levels of nad and these data are generated by gfinity if you want to measure your own blood intracellular levels of nad discount link in the video's description so when looking at these data plasma tri trigonelline on the x-axis we can see that there is not a significant correlation between plasma trigonelline with ned as the p value is far greater than 0.05 at 0.49 so no no significant correlation for plasma trigonelline with nad now it looks like there are a couple of outliers on this plot the one at the far right at 7 micromolar is clover sprouts induced so that's not likely an outlier but for this uh data point here that was 600 mg of nicotinic acid per day which increased nad but you you can see that trigonelline levels were relatively low so it's not a trigonelline increasing nad story so even if we take out uh that that data point as a potential outlier which it's not again because nicotinic acid induced it the data looks pretty much flat for the correlation for plasma trigonelline with n at least within the 0 to2 micromolar range so what we can see from both both of these plots is that diet can ind indeed increase plasma levels of trigonelline but not high enough to impact nad at least for me over a test but there may be good news to the story and i thought the trigonelline story was over but trigonelline is now available by supplement and i started that experiment i'm going to do a 10day experiment with 1 gram of trigonelline per day that's a 10x further increase above my highest dietary intake of trigonelline which i achieve with clover sprouts about 100 milligrams per day so supplementing with a gram a day so 500 milligram twice a day to separated uh you know early early in the morning and later in the day so we'll see if one gram makes a dent now i haven't decided if i'll go higher i think the human equivalent dose that they used in the mous study was about 1.6 gam of trigonelline per day so i may go as high as that but i'm going to wait to see what the results show for blood uh intracellular levels of nad and i'm planning on sending metabolomic data out on that day too so next friday so we'll see if 1 gr of trigonelline supplemental is able to increase plasma levels plasma levels of trigonelline but then also blood intracellular levels of nad all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health which includes ap b but also grimage die tracking or green tea dieet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or dire ching brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
