# Foods That Could Increase NAD: Chickpeas

Trigonelline which is also known as one methyl nicotinic acid increases nad levels in mice and if you missed that video it'll be in the right corner but what about in people can dietary trigonelline increase nad in people so for today's video we'll take a look at foods that could increase nad including chickpeas so why chickpeas chickpeas contain trigonelline 350 microgr per gram or. 35 mg per gram so with that in mind for 27 days before testing nad levels i added chickpeas into the diet an average of 69 grams per day and that's the dry weight which yields a trigonelline content daily intake of 24 mig per day when multiplying 69 by 35 mig per gram but note that one of the foods that i took out steel cut oats also contains some amount of trigonelline albeit not as much as chickpeas so when subtracting the amount that's found in oats at the higher level oats can have between .1 and2 milligram per gram of trigonelline and i covered that in an earlier video so when subtracting out 7 milligrams coming from oats with an average of about 30 grams of oats per day that yields a net addition of 17 milligrams of trigonelline per day so did 17 milligrams of trigonelline per day impact nad blood intracellular nad levels so to test that on january 15th i sent blood to gfinity for ned analysis and if you want to measure your own ned levels there's a discount link in the video's description for this test it was 25.6 micromolar which unfortunately 17 milligrams of trigonelline per day was not enough to increase nad and we know that by looking at my nad test results from january of 2023 through january of 2024 which is shown here so for the most recent test with 17 milligrams of trigonelline per day an average addition for 27 days before the test we can see that 25 .6 micromolar value which is exactly the same as the first test that i ever took measuring nad levels with no nad precursors in other words this is essentially my base or pretty close to my baseline and we know that because for four other tests without any precursors ned levels have never been higher than 26 micromolar but for a bunch of tests with with ned pre precursors we can see that blood intracellular nad levels were greater than 26 micromolar for each of those tests with only one exception 300 mig of nn per day didn't make a dent on nad levels essentially the same as my baseline 25.3 micromolar versus 25.6 so with that in mind is the trigonelline ned experiment over it didn't move the needle it didn't get it past 26 micromolar so why even bother well it's possible that the the intake 17 milligrams of chenell per day may not be enough and with that in mind fenu greek seeds as shown here have more trigonelline than chickpeas so how much trigonelline do fen fenugreek seeds have in one study 91.2 milligrams per gram in a second study 98.4 milligrams per gram and note that these two studies uh the trigonelline content in fenu greek seeds is 260 to 280 times more that's found in chickpeas but in a third study trigonelline levels in fenu greek seeds were only 262 which is 2.6 milligram per gram nonetheless that's still seven times higher than in chickpeas so to test whether adding more trigonelline into the diet getting with the goal of getting 60 milligrams of trigonal per day so why that amount that's because 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid and remember trelan is converted directly into nicotinic acid 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid increased my blood intracellular nad levels to 37.9 micromolar so for a test that i sent for analysis actually today i drew blood on friday i averaged about 24 grams of feny greek seeds per day using the lowest content of trigonelline in fenor greek seeds 2.6 milligram per gram i should have achieved at least 60 milligram of trigonelline per day with potentially higher it may be potentially higher based on the studies that showed 90 to 100 milligrams of trigonelline per day so with that in mind did it raise nad any d levels stay tuned for that data coming in a video in a few weeks all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for anyd quantification epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes aob green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
