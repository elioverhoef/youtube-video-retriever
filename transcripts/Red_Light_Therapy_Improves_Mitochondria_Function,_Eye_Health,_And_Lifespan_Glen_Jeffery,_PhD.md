## Transcript

Hey everyone today's guest is dr glenn jeffrey who is a professor of neuroscience at university college london today dr jeffrey will present findings for red light red light therapy on improving mitochondrial function eye health and aging so with that welcome dr jeffrey and uh let's get into the presentation thank you very much um pleasure pleasure to be here let me uh let me run you through a few slides telling you about some of the things we're doing and hopefully uh giving you a bit of background i'm glenn jeffrey i'm professor of neuroscience at university college london and i'm very interested as i'm getting older i'm particularly interested in the problems of aging what we can do about aging how we can make the quality of aging a better experience so um let me tell you a little bit about my story and the sorts of things that interest me so one of the key things about aging is really that as we get older we're less able to do things you know we we find kicking our legs out of bed a little bit more difficult we find doing a 17 times table a little bit more difficult and so what is the aging is a multiple multifactorial issue but from my point of view i'm interested between the relationship between light and aging there is a relationship between the two so particularly sunlight what a sunlight do for us because sunlight the light in which we live is changing enormously now we're moving into led lighting and away from sunlight so i'm quite interested in the way that we've evolved and what something called mitochondria do for us now mitochondria are our batteries in our cells um they provide us with energy and for many many billions of years life on planet earth was um was really very very much a slime as you can see in the in the bottom here it was a slime but we progressed to a a situation where we have plants we have organisms we have animals and the things that are driving that are a mitochondria mitochondria in our body um consume oxygen and consume sugar and they take us from something that really can't do very much to an organism that can function so uh i think very much about evolution in terms of mitochondria and what they do the power they give us so let's dig a little bit deeper and let's just cover the basics of what mitochondria are just think about them as a battery that we don't have to be any more complicated than that so they produce something called atp which is if you think it's the energy the battery produces and atp is a molecule and you produce your own body weight in atp every day that tells you how how critical atp is and it's the atp that is the energy and as we get older as we suffer with disease as we suffer with a whole range of things atp goes down so perhaps a key to us trying to improve the aging process is improving atp and and so please think about mitochondria's batteries that's all they are fundamentally and this is kind of what they look like um and over on the right hand side you can see a cell where all the mitochondria have been labeled in red and you can see that there are vast numbers of them in in our cells there could be thousands of them in the cells and like all batteries as we age the battery runs down and then it does something that your car tree does as well it starts to produce what we'll call acid it starts to leak something which is inflammatory and we call it reactive oxygen species but let's just say it r it produces something now which is working against you and it's one of the reasons why as we age we find uh inflammation we find inflammation in our joints we find inflammation in our muscles which we don't recover from quite as well because the charge on the battery goes down and the battery starts to produce acid instead of energy so two things can we increase the power in the battery and can we also reduce the acid that's leaking from it so one of the reasons that i'm particularly interested and why i think this is really relevant to us is that some parts of our body use a lot of energy and other bits don't to a first approximation your thigh bone does not use much energy but there are two places in your body where you use vast amounts of energy the first and the most surprising one is your retina your retina uses more energy than any other organ in your body um and it because of this it ages rapidly and it suffers from inflammation why do we use so much energy well you you don't notice it but as you go from a darkish room to a very very bright room the battery has got to change the power it gives to the amplifier the amplifier is always being turned up or turned down because of the light levels we go through and the other organ that is not in the least bit surprising is the brain the brain you consumes enormous amount of atp and when our energy runs down we find we're getting diseases now that are very common so we get alzheimer's disease we get parking son's disease parkinson's disease is fundamentally a mitochondrial disease and we get macular degeneration macular degeneration in as with these other aging diseases increasing enormously and it's about mitochondria so mitochondria regulating the way we age regulating our health spans so what's light got to do with it well mitoch are very sensitive to light this is quite surprising and our light in our world is changing enormously so here is a diagram of the wavelengths of light that is in our daylight now we don't see most light that is out in the atmosphere we only see a very very restricted range and it's marked on this diagram you can see that is the light we see but this is the light that is there and because we don't see it it doesn't mean that other parts of our body don't see it so we've evolved under this daylight we evolved originally in africa um on a 1212 light dark cycle because we were close to the equator so day length didn't really change we were exposed to light because we didn't wear clothes uh we were largely naked and a lot of those long wavelengths of light the ones that deep deep red that we can't see they actually penetrate very deep in your body and we've done experiments here where we've stood people out in on day of strong sunlight and we can measure those long wavelengths coming through the body we can measure them coming out of the back of people so for millions of millions of years humans have had a wide exposure to light and that light has gone deep in their bodies and mitochondria are paying attention to that light so how do we divide those wavelengths of light up well i'm going to do it very crudely i'm going to divide it between the red and the blue so the red is around 650 nanometers which you can see it's quite deep red it's a bicycle light through to 900 nanometers that you can't see and those are absorbed by mitochondria and let's put it very very simply they reach charge the battery and that actually is really true the mitochondria have got a charge on them and when you put them under red light the charge increases and you get more atp remember atp is running down as you get old so that's a that's a good thing they also absorb deep blue light here i'm saying that's 420 to 450 nanometers that's a very very deep blue color and what that does is it partially discharges the battery there's less atp so if your uh if your system is running down because you know you're like me uh getting old uh the blue light is running down your battery now remember though from that first picture i showed you blue and red in sunlight have a natural balance and sunlight hasn't changed over over animal evolution it's roughly been the same it's the balance that we're used to and that's critical so let's do an experiment so in this experiment we chose a wavelength of like 670 nm that's fairly deep red um and what we did is we exposed mice to those long wavelengths of light and there are some simple histograms here there's red and there's blue the red is the mice that were exposed to the long wavelength light and the controls in white they didn't get exposed to it well the first thing to point out is that here in aging we actually find that atp is increased in the retina by giving red light the mitochondria are absorbing it and it is increasing the amount of atp that they're producing it's charging the battery and the battery is giving off m more power so that's very much in the retina but the same is true in the brain so these two figures here are one from the cortex and one from the thalamus which is very very deep brain the long wavelengths go through deep so the the exposure of this light to this animal is increasing the flow of energy from the battery this is a really complicated figure but let's do it in one so if you record if you increase the atp how do you know you're making something better well one of the things you can do is you can record from the retina by putting a little piece of gold foil on the eye and this was done in mice we've done similar things in humans and if we look here we've got a young mouse and then we've got an old mouse all you need to do is think to yourself hang on young mouse to old mouse the size of these waves that we're getting back from the retina are going down and that's because we're aging this mouse is aging seven mth seven months is actually quite an old age for a mouse but this mouse here who had a burst of red light he's not been returned to a two-month old mouse but he's much better than the seven-month old mouse that did not have exposure to the light so we know what's going on at cellular level the mitochondria pro improving the amount of atp is improving and so is the function of the retina the retin is improving so we're going from light to molecule to cell to function now again don't worry about this don't worry about the s about this graph but if you shine light on a part of the body and you improve that function what happens to other parts of your body and what this shows you is two groups of mice controls in black experimentals in red and we're taking the blood from those mice and we're hunting for a signal that says to us has anything changed after the red light and we look at something called a cyto it's a it's an immunological marker and the interesting thing is and the take home from this is if you shine red light on an animal and i think exactly the same as us you change messages in the blood and the messages you're changing in the blood are messages that are associated with improving your mitochondria and improving your function so if you if mitochondria talk across the body now we had an idea that this was true sometime ago but um this study shows that not only do mitochondria improve across the body but some of this signaling is going through their blood is it making any difference so ages what's the key thing about aging well health span how long do we live now when you're doing experiments on health span one of the problems that you've got is that you can't really do it on humans um it's a big population study um even mice is a bit challenging because mice can live two and a half years and that's not it's expensive keeping mice large co cohorts and mice for two and a half years so a good reason to go down and look at a simpler system now the key to looking at a simpler system is that everything we find in a human we find in a mouse we find in a bumblebee we find in a fly we find in a worm this is a highly conserved function so here we take a cohort of flies young flies and along the bottom we've got their lifespan most flies die at 12 weeks and half of those flies we give red light to burst of red light in the morning and half are under normal lighting and all we do it's a simple experiment is each day or each week we count them so with age the number of flies goes down but the number of flies we find present each day in the group that are exposed to red light is larger and so by the time we get to around eight to nine weeks of age we've got twice as many flies alive that have been exposed to the red light than those that haven't now we're not increasing absolute lifespan we're increasing average lifespan and what we're eroding is we're eroding all those or the very large proportion of those middle-age deaths the middle-aged flies are living longer and the great thing about it is if we look at this the red light and the non- red light we look at how far they can climb they can climb further so that means they're living longer and on top of that they've got better motor function now it wouldn't be great if we could do that in humans because it might mean that you can walk further and you've got less chances of falling over and breaking your hip which is very often uh fatal in the long run but it's more than that you know it's it's the fly doesn't have a big brain but it's certainly got a brain and here a very very simple experiment is we take flies that can't fly and we put them on an island in water and the first thing a young fly will do is it walks around the island and it tries to find where the limits of its territory are and you can see they just walk round and round and round in circles and they'll do it they'll do it all day trying to find a way out because they can't fly now if we take old flies six week old flies we put them on that island and they don't walk around in circles they get confused they get very confused and they'll try and walk around but then they take odd trajectories and the older they are the more time they spend taking odd trajectories or simply not moving very much so we take our old flies and we give them a single burst of red light and then we put them in the island now we don't make those flies we don't take those flies back to being young flies but we have a significant improvement in their ability to navigate around their island so we're doing something which is we're doing something to their brain we're doing something to the way in which they explore their environ and they're now being much more systematic about it now we can we can we can play i i like the idea that we can do something with a fly that improves its cognitive ability right because there's another one that we we have a problem with as we get older i can't remember for the life of me where my door keys are i can't remember where my coffee cup is simple little things are just deeply annoying and you know they are annoying i'd like you just to look at these two histograms that sets of hisrs down here locomotor function how well do you walk well there's a big decline in how well you walk as you age your simple motor ability if we give that old fly a burst of red light its motor skill not just its climbing its motor skill improves not back to youth it's suddenly not a 15year old again but it has improved but the one that i love and we're still exploring is memory we we do a horrible thing to a fly which is we take a long tube and we shine a light at the end of that tube and the first thing the fly does it goes straight down the tube towards the light um doesn't hesitate older flies yeah they you know they begin to they begin to have problems with it but then we give them we do something absolutely awful to them we take a piece of filter paper that we dipped in quinine and we line the tube with the quinine the fly runs down the tube and it goes ah quinning i hate it and it stays still now the young fly will learn that on two or three trials the old fly just doesn't get it you know it time after time the light comes on it runs down it hits the quinning if we take the old fly and we give the old fly a burst of red light light we find that it learns that old fly learns that someone's put quinine down the tube and it doesn't try and go beyond it so here we've got a number of different factors we've got improvements in vision we've got improvements in cognition uh and we've got improvements in locomoter ability all the things we you know we'd love to have so how do we know that we're doing what we say we're doing how do we know that this light is affecting directly mitochondria and not operating in a slightly different way well this this came to me um and this is a genuine story cycling home uh a long hill to get home in the rain and i'd listened to a radio program and that radio program was talking about the crisis that bees have got with insecticide and the insecticide that bees were being given induced what was fundamentally parkinson's disease now as a great scientist john metanis have been working on parkinson's disease for ages in uh primates uh and on towards humans and he pointed out to me that this insecto side undermines specifically mitochondria nothing else it undermines mitochondria and produces parkinson like symptoms parkinson's disease is a mitochondrial disease so that started a very very different line of research for us where we started buying honey um bumblebee hives um and we we we then did very very simple experiments to show that it was the mitochondria that was being affected the insecticide we used was in maid was really brutal insect asde it stays in the ground for absolutely ages very difficult to get rid of quite cheap and so if we look at how mobile an animal is when it's been given the insecticide we can see it becomes very immobile it starts to look really unhealthy compared to a healthy animal and it just slows right down if we if we give the immac prid with the 670 burst of red light you can see the first first couple of days he not very happy it's a bit hung over but he has improved very significantly very different from the animal that has just had the poison so the poison is being blocked or the poison is being cor is correcting the disease that is inducing the parkinson type symptoms and life ban we can do exact exactly the same with the lifespan of the bee that we did with the fly so if we look at the number of bees that sub survive once they've had the immac prid you know the numbers go numbers dive down if we give the immacula prid with the 670 we correct that we correct it we're only giving immacula prid in a little we're only giving the red light in a small period but we can recover them but here's the really interesting thing and and we're still talking about this today even though this study was published some time ago and that is okay if we just give the animals red light no imid just give them red light nothing else okay they're doing very well doing very well but the red light stops and even when the red light stopped the animals are surviving much longer again absolute lifespan doesn't change but the middleaged bees are doing so much better so does that mean that if we can catch our mitochondria as they're starting to fail let's say we catch our mitochondria when we're 40 if we give them a big burst of light at 40 is that enough is that one exposure maybe for a few weeks of red light enough to sail us through the period where when we have middle-age cell loss that's something we're really working on at the moment but this had consequences and had consequences for america because in parts of america so much insecticide has been used particularly in northern california that um there are very very few pollinators very few pollinators so when you've got a crop it's very very difficult for you to progress with that crop because the flowers are not being poll pollinated so uh in texas and in florida there are companies that truck vast numbers of beehives up towards northern california and the lores stop there and they open them up and the bees come out and they pollinate well you know this this is a a very it seems like a sledgehammer to crack a nut but it works the downside is those be about 40% % of those beehives just don't make it back to florida or to texas um it's super you know it's stressful stressful for me to be in a car to drive from florida to northern california um but then to ask me to go there do a job and take me back again it's stressful it's very stressful for the bees so a company called bee futures we have no economic interest is now putting red lights in those trucks and i understand the uh the be loss is is very much reduced we've reduced the stress in the be population because we've improved their mitochondria can we do this in us in humans at this point we started to to to move right over to working on human subjects we're all interested in that we're all getting old and i'm in the institute of opthalmology at university college london so we're very eye oriented and this was actually quite a simple experiment we asked people can you see a letter that we present to you in either blue or in red if we degrade the letter so we the letter is becoming more and more fuzzy and we're saying what is that red letter what is it you got to identify an a a b c and it's called a threshold experiment we work out the level at which you can detect the letter and if you look at the black dots here for the blue and the black dots here for the red that's before we gave you red light we gave you a burst of red light a single three minute burst of red light and then we brought you back three hours later now that should remember your retina's got more mitochondria than anywhere else in your body your photo receptors it's a picture of the photo receptors and the red dots of the mitochondria more mitochondria than anywhere else and it ages rapidly we brought the people back 3 hours l later we retested them and the retesting is the red squares in almost every case the red squares are lower than the black circles that means your threshold has come down that means you can detect something more easily if we look at the population of people we did that in there's a 177% improvement in your threshold that's that's quite an improvement and it's slightly stronger for uh blue than it is for red but that's because your blue channel in vision is much frailer than your red you you you really as you get older your ability to see blues is reduced more so than it is for reds if you're diabetic if you've got macular degeneration your blues suffer but 3 minutes exposure and tested three hours later resulted in a very significant improvement how long can we keep it going well we can keep it going for a while but basically it's about a week so we've re re redid the study a week later we're running out of subjects here so there's fewer people but one week later we don't get that 177% we get 10% and we get 8% it's still significant it's still an improvement but red light a bir of red light does not last forever whether you're a fly a bumblebee a human or a mouse it always lasts roughly one week and that's that's telling me something about a mechanism only three minutes i mean now we do expose for much longer but you can be exposed for two minutes and you can be exposed for 15 minutes the results are pretty much the same so it's we we think this is a switch it's a switch we're turning on so remember i told you that mitochondria they're a fuel they provide fuel in atp but they need to be able to do that they need their own fuel to produce the atp and their own fuel is glucose blood sugar and oxygen so if m if we drive mitoch harder theoretically they should consume more glucose that's that's a potential little avenue and this this came um as a consequence of a long drive with a friend of mine to go and do a collaborative experiment and mike just said hang on if we if we drive the mitochondria harder can we reduce blood glucose it seemed to be something that was you know relatively obvious we did it first of all in bumblebees and we gave we made the bumblebees uh we gave them the blood glucose test we starved them overnight and we gave a big drop of glucose in the morning and some of them had blue light and some of them had red light and those that had red light reduced their blood glucose levels much better than the ones that had blue and so here's the human experiment this is a difficult experiment because it's an unpleasant experiment and getting subjects is always my my biggest problem so we gave people a very large they first of all they they had to starve overnight they came in and then we gave them a very large glucose load which is just really horrible we then pricked their finger every few minutes to test their blood sugar levels and we also wanted to know if this is working the way we think it's working then you should actually get an increase in co2 because you're using more oxygen as well as more sugar well the control experiment here is in green and this is done in a separate group of individuals and this is where they drink the glucose and you can see their blood glucose shoots up and very slowly after about an hour it comes down if we give you a a burst of red light in this case only over a relatively small area of your back remember mitochondria talk to one another they'll run around saying hey something's happening i'm being driven harder and if i'm being driven harder you better be driven harder as well we do that and the blood glucose levels do not go up as much to be sure that we're doing the right thing we measured the co2 and yes the co2 goes up because they're using the oxygen and they're using the uh the glucose at at the same time now interestingly 670 was the wavelength we used you can see 670 it's a bit on the it's it's it's kind of a brightish red light we've now changed this and we've gone over to deeper red lights that you can't see so we've invited people in to have a cup of coffee um we've sat them down next to a panel which has got 850 nomers in it can't see it it's very very very deep red light and we then invite them back a little bit later and we measure their blood glucose we measure their visual function everything improves so it's not this specific wavelength first of all secondly we can now introduce this into your world without you being aware of of it and we can have physiological effects and they're good so if we think about someone with compromised mitochondria we can potentially think about exposing them to light that doesn't disturb them one of my dream tickets that we had was that when you go to a cache machine you identify yourself by putting your hand onto the cach machine which identifies you with a long wavelength 850 nanometer light and while you're taking your cash out of the machine you're getting exposed to that long wavelength of light that is potentially improving your mitochondrial function now we thought that was all we thought that was that was basically science fiction it's not anymore it's really is not it's perfectly doable and one of the main groups of people we're currently working with are architects and lighting engineers architects and lighting engineers are very enthusiastic about this because they're being pushed very hard for healthy lighting so healthy lighting is a very big issue remember this this is the wavelength of solar light goes up to 2,000 nanometers and it's the light i pretty much grew up with and if you had an old incandescent light bulb that was hot that was the kind of light that it produced and that's the kind of light we've evolved under but this now is the light that we have it's an led light and it is very strong in the blue and it doesn't really have much beyond about 650 nanometers that's a big evolutionary change all these millions of years under one constant form of light and then in the early 2000s two people won the nobel prize for producing leds and the great thing about leds is they don't waste light because all that heat that was coming out was wasted on the old light bulbs but they are very very strong in the blue and we've suffered from this in a number of other ways our old fluorescent lights were very very strong in the blue and you know to show you how little attention we pay to the potential damage of blue light this here is the spectrum of light from a bmw new laser light which is an amazing light in a car it goes for absolutely everywhere down the motorway but it's got a really massive peak in the blue that we know undermines mitochondrial function so if we we i'm very very dubious about exposing people to blue light now in fact i i i really don't want to do it but someone else had done it some time ago and this was an experiment done at the university of s in the uk and they gave people an exposure to 420 450 nanometers they expos their whole bodies to it those wavelengths are very dominant in leds and they canulated them so they could measure a whole load of body features this shaded area is when the light came on and this is the systolic blood pressure that is the blood pressure when your heart goes oomph and and gives you a squeeze and it reduced very significantly so the moment that blue light came on there was a significant effect on the cardiovascular system to compensate for this you get an increase statistically significant increase in heart rate to make up for the drop in that pulse so when you turn now i don't know if when you turn on the led that happens but this wavelength of light 420 to 450 is a very big component to this effect in terms of your cardiovascular system so people going into rooms and working in office environments in the built environment are now constantly being exposed to wavelengths that have a direct effect upon cardiovascular system as well as almost certainly a negative effect on their control of their blood sugars so one interesting take for this is that we sto doing experiments with blue and people we just stop doing them i don't i can't do it ethically but i'm very happy to watch what others do particularly with animal models we don't work with animals really anymore we really just work with humans so if it is the case but red light makes mitochondria work harder they draw more sugar out of your blood and you move away from diab from a diabetic position and blue light slows your mitochondria down so mitochondria take less sugar out of your out of your blood what happens if you expose mice to blue light again in that same range 450 420 well they put on enormous amounts of weight very quickly at week one there is already a difference between those exposed to blue light and the controls they by you know by the time we're talking about week four they've more than doubled their weight gain you're not using that sugar in your serum and the consequence is you're starting to store it as fat and these people people these sorry these mice are becoming diabetic it's being controlled by light so what can we take away from this well i think we can take away from it the fact that um we now have a public health problem with light that impacts on aging and we need to be very very careful about a light exposure we're being starved of red light particularly in the built-in environment and one of my colleagues calls this modern scurvy because scurvy used to be a problem that sailors had because they had something missing they had vitamin c missing so they had scurvy and scurvy could kill them we have something missing now we have red light missing so the built environment is now dominated by short wavelengths and the longer wavelengths aren't there anymore so this has an impact on an aging population because we know mitochondria are regulating uh blood sugars but they're also regulating degenerative diseases there are lots of evidence now to show that mitochondrial failure is associated with dementia memory problems etc and so it's a public health issue affecting aging it drives aging there's a thing called the mitochondrial theory of aging it really it came out in the 1950s and it just said mitochondria will determine how long you live and of all the theories of aging that come and go this one has stuck to the wall it's stuck to the wall really well um i' would love to meet the person who who had the generated the theory but it's guided our research very strongly so we need to increase the deep red light that we very often can't see and we can do that in buildings but we can also do that by just going outside into daylight and there are some very interesting kind of observational things that come out from from this imbalance in lighting the one that i really love is nasa published a study a very high-profile journal called cell and they said there's something wrong with the astronauts on the international space station they're becom pre-diabetic and they're aging more rapidly i those are big phrases these people are super fit super healthy characters they're being monitored all the time but look at a photograph in the international space station what you see is you see an environment lit with hard white leds and those people are up there for months under those lighting conditions the other one that i like which i think is also desperately interesting is where is diabetes really peing well diabetes has many reasons you know for it you know people sit in front of televisions but one place that really peaks is in is in the arabian peninsula what happens in the arabian peninsula you don't go outside you don't go outside because it's too hot it's too uncomfortable so you sit inside so you don't get any natural light but then what about windows well architects now are building buildings in glass with red light blocking glass they block the infrared so you can control the temperature within a room within a building so big glass structures most people seem to have large amounts of glass in buildings but if you've got infrared blocking glass you've now got two things working against you you've got the leds and you've got the fact that natural glass natural light is not coming through and in red is being blocked quite interestingly um the mayo clinic is putting up a very very very expensive new building uh in rochester and one of the remits they've given the architects is the building must be must be healthy in terms of its light and also healthy in terms of the air that's in the building now the architects that were given that brief um were a bit surprised about the issue of light because it was only just beginning to come out but i'm very pleased to say they walked through the door here and we had a long conversation with them so how do you balance that issue of blocking infrared light and at the same time controlling the temperature and the health inside the building well we need to find filters for glass that block only partially the infrared allowing you to control the light in the building but also at the same time allowing stuff in so that you're in a healthy light environment so i started off as a scientist a visual scientist someone asked me what do i do i'm professor of neuroscience at university college london uh you know i do stuff on vision if someone asked me what i do now i say i work in public health with an interest in aging and that's where i am now thank you thanks glen that was great uh so questions please do all right so our first put on my skeptic hat and uh so just to make an analogy um lab animals never see sunlight well actually let me take a step back so if you feed mice a purified high-fat diet which contains no real food um so the mice get uh obese they have poor metabolic health and they get obese uh but then if you feed them uh soluble fiber so the high fat purified diet is not just a high-fat diet on the surface that sounds terrible high fat diet but if you investigate deeper they don't have fermentable fiber soluble fiber so when you supplement these mice with soluble fiber that improves metabolic health they get leaner which suggests that soluble fiber plays an essential role i.e it's an essential nut nutrient right so when considering that flies and and uh mice uh at least in the lab are essentially sunlight deprived right sunlight in that case would be like soluble fiber so now is are some of the effects that that you see and others have seen is that because we're working with a a deficient or completely an aspect of health that should be there and it's not so when you're adding it back in now we see some of these positive you know effects on uh median lifespan like in the flies or in healths span related measures in in uh in mice so what what are your thoughts about i i well i i'm in complete agreement with you um the first thing i you know when i when i give a talk like this you come away thinking glenn's only interested in light i know that i'm cutting on one edge and you cannot view lifespan and you cannot view health totally in terms of light it's a big player it's a big player but it's not the only player i think dy is massive i think d i look at i look at um primates that are kept in primate colonies that are fed um what we would regard as fantastic food you know basically fruit fiber and all the rest they're not getting half the diseases that we as fellow primates are getting they are definitely not getting those diseases so macular degeneration in a primate i have looked at hundreds of primate eyes i've never seen it i've never seen anything that comes close to it so listening to me one is in danger of thinking that light controls everything it does not i think diet is we if we were sitting in a room we're saying what's controlling aging what's controlling health span light and diet are up there at the top and probably a number of other things that we're not aware of but you are you know the other thing is you are absolutely right to say well look we're all you know the mice they in rooms with led lighting and all the rest of it even worse the foundation of a lot of medical experiments is done on tissue in in in in tissue incubators so they they're in the dark to kick off with and then when they do come out they're under hard led lighting so i did suggest to a few people here that first of all they put a 1212 uh daylight bulb in their tissue incubators um and it caused quite a ruffle because the experiments were coming out rather differently so that's i don't want to cause too much trouble i'll be really happy to go to the grave if we can just change the light bulbs for us as public health but when you think of the vast amount of science that's actually done or based on tissue culture experiments fundamentally in the dark and then just taken out occasionally under harsh blue light that's not the way bodies work so multiple factors and diet high fiber diet yeah completely agree with you yeah so that's a great point i wasn't even thinking about tissues being under what type of lighting which could impact the results which is a great it's almost kind kind of like working under anerobic conditions which maybe in certain pos you know certain positions in the body like the intestine versus aerobic conditions and if you're not controlling for that when you're doing experiments you're going to get results that may be not physiological right similarly under the lighting yeah i i i i we we you have to be careful about you know being called a troublemaker but to be honest with you if you stand back and you look at things you think hang on this should all be done differently the trouble is society has made such a big investment in doing it wrong that changing it is not acceptable so should we be doing all these experiments on mice which have been that the the main mouse model that's used the c-57 black has been inbred since 1937 if you take 15 in c57 mice you will find that the females i think what one in 10 one in 12 has got a slightly smaller right eye you know hang on you know we've drifted a long way here and also mouse immunology is nothing like human immunology so we got to question the models and we got to question the methods all right so what would the data look like if uh lab animals were exposed to sunlight from birth you know for some regular amount each day uh would red light have effect in that situation and if not then i mean granted maybe they're in other words do you have to be quote unquote deficient in sunlight in order to see positive effects of red light therapy um well i think that we all are deficient that's true um we did do a series of experiments on mice just keeping them under daylight bulbs right so um things looked better but i didn't carry on with it i didn't carry on with it because i was having to deal with lifespans of two and a half years and it cost me it cost me a lot of money to keep one mouse for a week um one other thing that we have done though is you know we run around the place very often just changing the light bulbs taking and it's not that we we we give everyone red light what we've started to do is we've taken out the leds and we put in old incandescent light bulbs now that has had really a very inter interesting effect both in the animal house and in our environment i mean it is very interesting um it's a problem it's a problem for me getting hold of them but you can still buy them um on amazon in the uk america is taking the first steps to block it to making the sale of incandescent light bulbs illegal i cannot tell you how we're kicking against that and the architects here are kicking against it you've taken those steps in advance of what goes on in the uk the european union is trying to move to that direction as well but the light that comes of an incandescent light bulb an old light bulb got loads of infrared in it it mirrors the sun really does um yeah i i i had dinner last night with two of my aunts and actually i gave them two incandescent light bulbs and i said just do whatever you're doing under this for a few hours every day uh maybe we'll turn that around maybe we won't but phillips and and the other big lighting companies are not listening well i mean wouldn't the ideal be to get some sunlight and then maybe go no lights when one gets home i mean just avoid when the sun goes down there's no light on and you just you know i i yeah yeah again i'm sorry i'm agreeing with you um the natural his your natural evolutionary history is not to have light in the evenings and the night um this brings in another issue about this whole red light factor which is it really only works very well in the mornings right so it doesn't really work in the afternoons now and that's true again if you're a fly a mouse a be human i think it's critical that you get it in the mornings because when you wake up in your evolutionary history you've been very vulnerable because you've not been paying attention to anything so when you wake up in the morning um your blood sugar's peak whether you've eaten or not your blood sugars go up your hormones all change you become a lot more geared up to running doing something um in the afternoon i cannot improve your mitochondria in the afternoon no matter what i do how much red light i give them i cannot improve them we say in the afternoon mitochondria doing something else we don't know what they're doing they're doing the washing they're doing the ironing they're doing their housework it's in the mornings and and you know they know it's coming so m atp starts peing just before when lights are on so in the animal house so i think we probably knew when we were in evolving in africa and in the equator we knew at about 7 o'clock in the morning sun was right going to be rising and mitochondria changed their behavior we we' just messed that all up so badly is is that because of the uh spectrum of sun uh you know so i think you me mentioned that it's an equal balance of blues and reds in sunlight but is the balance of blue versus red more heavily weighted towards red and near infrared in you know at sun up relative to other times in the day no uh we find that a very very difficult one to get our handle on there is a change and the change is because when the sun is low on the horizon light has to pass through a lot more of the atmosphere and the atmosphere can have a differential filter um i'm going to stick with my idea that the morning is absolutely crucial it is not immediately obvious that is that globally red is much stronger in the morning but you know when i talk about red light we're talking about you know 670 all the way through to 900 it's perfectly possible that someone's going to come along and say actually did you know the 825 or some reas is the key one and i don't have enough heartbeats left to go through all the wavelengths and check them and find out what's cru critical all i can do is say look let let's let's get rid of flood lights let's get rid of leds i know that's a step in the right direction there's a lot of big unknowns here a lot of them all right so uh changing gear so the mouse study where you did the uh cyto kindes where you looked at the cyto i noticed that upregulated in response to 670 nanometers were a lot of pro-inflammatory pyocin tnf alpha il6 interfere on gamon gamma so how do you rationalize an increase in pro-inflammatory cyto kindes with an improvement in you know health span related measures in the mice so i can tell you in all honesty we got that first set of data out i was unhappy there was a difference but i was unhappy but i had a couple of you know fairly long conversations with immunologists and lifespan people uh we've got a big lifespan group at ucl here in london and the issue really is that changes in increases in cyto kindes can be highly protective and it's like saying something's coming brace yourself for it you make the system more robust now one of the issues about the the cyto study is there were so many cyto kindes and their relative movements were so complicated then my first reaction was i went and discussed it with rheumatologists who kind of knew a lot more about about cyto and it really is a job for a a mathematician i i only look to 50 you know 5050 is a small sample so the aging people did not have any problem with this because they said small levels of inflammation at certain periods at certain times is highly protective i have to say i'm not an immunologist i i grabbed a low hanging fruit on that experiment but the point is that all those changes in cyto kindes were strongly associated with significant improvements in aged health yeah it could be that the animals at at that age have a problem in producing those cyto kindes so yeah i i i'm on that side too where maybe that's you know a a stimulus like so immunosenescence where you know you have a declining immune system maybe the red light stimulated the immune system to produce cyto kindes as a potential compensatory effect to battle off whatever microbes maybe you know they couldn't normally uh fight off so yeah no i i i agree with that again i have to say that this area of science is is is is kind of like being in physics in the 1600s there are so many massive gaps however i can also say that we've got enough information to make some big stabs at things so um you know we we've got some children with mitochondrial disease and that's that's that's a killer you know lots of them don't make it beyond 2530 because their heart gives out we've been giving them a red light and and you know get very significant results fact we got the we tested them on how well they could open their eyes their eyelids because it's a muscle simple muscle and when we saw the when we saw the first first set of results photographs i must admit i i left the room because i was too tearful you know these young kids and these kids now some of these kids are walking reasonable distances it's a systemic effect but all those little all those little details we we we don't know but i can i'm going to stick my neck out and i'm going to say we've never found a downside we found situations where nothing happens give too much red light nothing happens overcharge a battery maybe i i don't know but it's safe and i'm being pragmatic it's very effective in some cases and what can we do with an aging population you know um we've got to give them everything we possibly can especially a sunlight the ficient population and uh you know exposed to the unnatural lighting also right which maybe heavy in the blues so the the lightspan data suggests that or some of the lipan data suggests that there may be or and your you know the stuff you presented um suggest that there may be older ages where red light therapy just loses its efficacy and that it's got to be done at sort of middle age or even maybe before um so how can how do you rationalize that where it just seems like you know maybe whether it's mitochondria or other systemic effects where you know the body is beyond rejuvenation at that point how do you balance that with you know doing it at younger ages where you seem to get some effects on health span related measures well you picked on a point that that is an important one um and let me fill in a bit of space around that so um when we did our first study on macular degeneration we got nothing we got no result at all and i i went away thinking you know really questioning questioning what i was doing um and then you i spoke to john metanis about it who's been doing a lots of work on primates and parkinson's disease and he said glenn you got to catch it early if it's gone beyond a certain point it's not going to work so i went back and i looked at the data from the patients that we' recruited and they had disease that had dug in you know they had you could look at their retina and you could say oh they're starting to lose lots of cells now someone's replicated my study and they've done it on people at a much earlier stage of disease and i'm pleased to say they got great results so whatever you do there's a window for catching things if we take someone who's got really bad macular degeneration i i don't think anything can happen at all and they shouldn't get their hopes up about it it means that we've got to look for disease early we've got to catch disease early macular degeneration very unfortunately people turn up at optometrist and the optometrist said well you got start macular degeneration nothing we can do and so you go off we don't get those patients we tend to get the patients once to come to the hospital by which case their retine are something like a car crash you can't deal with that so there is something and then maybe we can say the same about a maybe we should be saying let's get those red lights back into your environment when you're 3540 right maybe that's when we've got a we've got a a key window for maximum improvement but i don't know what that key window is i don't know what the best wavelength of light is you know there's a whole series i've got the big picture it's good but there are a lot of unknowns but there the b experiment i keep bringing this up with my colleagues the b experiment is telling us something very important um that you've got to give it early all right so what about uh the fire spectrum the spectrum of fire right so clearly that's in our evolutionary history maybe not every day i find it doubtful that you know prehistoric or however you want to define them humans were lighting fires every day but when we did light it it was a part of our evolutionary history right so what's the uh balance between reds and blues in fire and uh yeah that well that depends what you burn to be honest right uh but there is a lot of infrared in fire light and actually there was a there was a physical anthropologist who picked up on this and talked to me about it it never occurred to me never occurred to me um i think it is important fire is important in human evolution for lots of different reasons i mean we cook food so it lasts longer um it's easier to digest lots and lots of but fire light in ear early humans that moved north okay so they moved out of africa they moved through the levent and they ended up in i i always say this just i suppose it annoys a few people i say they ended up in tooting which is a really pretty poor suburb in south london you know it's just grim gray and unpleasant you start wearing clothes uh because you're cold it's gray all the time i think that's where it punched i think that's where it could well have punched so the fact that red light penetrates so deeply through the body it does affect physiology there's something in it and and i'm still talking to the anthropologist because it's a great new angle on the whole thing it it really is that they jumped on it immediately um and they were telling me that there is a an open zoo in japan where they've got reese's maca and they started lighting fires for them and they said it was just like the humans they all sat around stared at the fire in little groups the only thing that was missing is they weren't holding a can of beer you know which is what people tend to do but if if there's one thing i want to get hold of before i die it's that thing on fire light what what is it about fire light i know it goes deep in the body i suspect we might be able to measure it coming out the back um god what's it doing that's a big question all right so the other side of that coin is too what's the uh light spectrum what does that look like in moonlight reds blues how does that look and um y the energy is so low so so i one of the guys that i work with bob fosbury he's an astronomer um and um he's responsible for the spectrometry on the james webb telescope um he retired and he walked into the lab saying oh this look interesting can i join and he knew about li don't know anything about light in honesty you know i went to university and i did a degree in experimental psychology i didn't really even have a biology background the light i i i asked about starlight and i asked about moonlight and apparently is so weak that it's it's not a player in this field or not at the moment anyway gotcha all right so then next steps what what studies you have currently uh underway or grants that are in preparation uh for next steps next step step next steps are how do i bring back red light into your life in a way that you don't notice and is good for you so it's all about um it's all about cheap devices that you can have in your home so uh redesigning light bulbs taking led light bulbs and sticking an 800 nanometer chip in there and being able to have that light available for you for very economically that is what i really really want to do for impact um i want to have understand what the different wavelengths are like are doing in development um i was contacted by a really charming nurse in texas and she rang up and she was talking about blue light for babies that don't have their liver function isn't isn't as good as it could be and so you give them blue light to break down billy rubin and i said well you know actually my youngest son had that and he was under blue light for 12 hours and she said no no said because you can make money by keeping babies in hospital our babies are here for five or six days under blue light so that kicked off the whole issue of what is blue light potentially blue and red light doing in development um and i'm very happy to hand that on to colleagues and i'm i'm actually doing that i mean i probably won't be here in 10 years so i'm handing that on to colleagues um and the other one as you say to be abely honest is is about fire light and if you go back through my history you'll see i spent a lot of time working in the arctic i spent a lot of time working in the arctic on what light is doing and how animals respond to light it's the bigger questions the real bigger questions that i you know i'm not doing experiments on test tubes anymore i'm not doing experiments on i want to know about evolution i want to know about development and i want my two aunts to still be with me in 10 years time and be as difficult and awkward in 10 years time as they are today um hopefully but you know someone walked into my lab once and said have you read this paper about red light 15 years ago and i went that's rubbish that's absolute rubbish typical response and i was wrong someone walked into my lab again it was john mitrofanis and said do you know that two cells can talk to one another in the body by light signals and i said that's rubbish and again i i exam a phd last week in london and their results were stunning showing that light light could transmit signals between two cells in the body wow we didn't know that yeah there's a lot to keep me busy yeah so i mean this gets into the realm of the quantum right quantum effects which happened in mitochondria and there's some evidence published evidence that quantum effects maybe at the seat of consciousness you know in microt tual so in microt yeah so uh yeah all right so people support your work um i think when my work started no one believed it and i did take a lot of stick um particularly from the clinicians they they they they they were very negative whereas the architects were going wow this is great um i think people keeping an open mind would be by far the best thing they could do i mean if there are any multi-millionaires that wish to make massive donations i'd be very happy to have them but you know i've always felt that in science sitting down and thinking and getting the question right is a lot more important than spending a lot of money um and not thinking about what the question so often we get a result and we didn't get the question right in the first place so the result is it's not worthless but it's not that it's not it's not that important i think i i would like people to live healthy longer lives and they can do it really simple and don't believe anyone who comes along and says you really need to buy this this light bulb that's going to cost you $500 that's rubb one little story i've said this a number of times i had to reject a lady from a clinical trial for red light and she was very annoyed with me and um all right fine it happens um she came back few weeks later and she had a battery in her hand and she had an led and she joined the two together and she stuck it in front of her eye and she said will that work i was appalled i was absolutely appalled i said to someone in the lab would you mind while i give this lady a cup of tea would you mind having a look at this led and this battery for me and they came back 20 minutes later and they said that will probably work so you don't need high technology you just need to bring that light back in i don't recommend people buy leds and batteries and stick them in front of their eyes but it was a good example where she'd gone away and thought about it she'd resourced it and she got it right you know i felt an abs i felt an absolute i felt very bad about the fact that then that i rejected from the trial that if i hadn't rejected from the trial she wouldn't have done that so i wouldn't have known yeah all right so i also have to ask why do you think you're not going to be around in 10 years so a major focus of my channel is you know to conquer aging or die trying so you look like you've got well beyond 10 years well i'm lucky on that one um but i'm i'm 70 at my next birthday the university will keep me on um they don't have a policy on you having to retire um i'm i'm fortunately aware i can get away with being a bit younger than 70 um but one's got to be realistic there has to be a point where i mean i'm never going to retire because i'm always going to be thinking right but i may not be thinking in a in a in a lab environment but there again if i'm thinking about human evolution i don't need a lab i just need more time to think so but i will i mean i cycled i cycle uh 8 to 10 miles every day i know that cycle ride home is just take up the hill is taking me just a little bit longer but as my son says to me you've got to carry on cycling and i promise myself i will do yeah and maximum human lifespan is 120 i mean all right 80 is the average close to the average for a man you know but you should be well beyond 10 years you know way more than that you know so well but the other thing is we shouldn't be to i'm i was started off being quite concerned about lifespan i'm now much more concerned about health span y so health span is where is where we want to is where we want to put our finger we want to keep people out of hospitals you know um we want to make sure people do go for walks so but but we all have to come to terms with aging there's no point me sitting here saying 100 20 i'm going to be you know cycling 10 miles a day because i probably won't right so when you consider though that the rate of aging is pretty much a constant i mean you can accelerate that with a pretty bad diet and you can slow it down maybe calorie restriction and other stuff where where are we in terms of knowledge in terms of the rate of aging right are we down here stone ages or are we somewhere pretty close to matching those rates now is that going to happen in the next 10 to 50 years the you know our natural remaining lifespan i don't know but eventually those slopes are going to match and then it's a matter of flattening the curves right so yeah i agree i i i i i agree i think also the aging pe the people in aging research have got very very caught up in a number of issues tere lengths you know um i think there are a lot more basic things going on that we you know we we should be aware of that are much lower technology much lower technology walking just walking uh right you know but at some point we would need the rejuvenation tech right because even for people who are active and eat a healthy diet and stay relatively lean they're not living past 120 right i mean we get this in animal studies right so there still will have to be some rejuvenation technology whether it's epigenetic repro reprogramming or maybe red light therapy to rejuvenate eyes and mitochondria as a part of that story there's got to be rejuvenation tech at some point to push beyond that what now whether that's going to be within the next you know 50 years 200 years eventually it's it's only a matter of time before those slopes the questions it it will happen i am a little pessimistic about it happening in my lifespan it will someone will be able to go back and reprogram that will happen i personally having looked at it i don't see a doorway at the moment i just don't see i i i i have experienced lots of stuff on stem cells and and stem cells may actually be absolutely fine in cardiac tissue i've yet to see anything that really impresses me on stem cells in the retina i you know in fact actually i'm i'm extremely negative about it because i don't see the door forward this is people rushing in not asking the question carefully before they do it but you're right someone somewhere will find a way of reprogramming clear clearing out the debris you know i remember guys from fiser talking to them about this you know this they called it gunk cleaning they were going to peruse you with something that was going to clear out all the gunk and i thought yeah you know that's that's somewh will get that right yeah so how would you rejuvenate the aged eye i mean independent of red light therapy i mean uh you know what would be your bet on what would be the best way to rejuvenate the eye well that's that's a real difficult one because if you go back to the stem cell technologies even if you got a stem cell in there which a few have done and the stem cell lives it doesn't connect up properly right it's you're you're then going to have something in there that's going to be confusing you know it's going to be saying the wrong message to the to the to the cells that it talks to i don't know about the eye and i don't know about the brain i just genuinely don't know i have certain things you know we know that we know that um that reducing inflammation is important d is age related macular degeneration and the aging eye suffers in exactly the same way as in cardiovascular disease these big deposits behind your retin are associated with uh age related macular degeneration there's loads of fat in them right there loads of fat in them and it's it's about a dirty membrane that restricts the flow of oxygen so if you could do one thing for it my first step my first pragmatic step is a pluming job which is how do you clear the debris that accumulates at the back of the eye um under the photo receptors that restricts the flow of oxygen and nutrients and that's a clear target i don't know how you do it i'm a visual scientist i've been doing vision since i was my last year as an undergraduate i don't know how you do it but maybe someone in a drug company will go with profus you with x or y and it will clear the gunk out so much of so much of aging aging has got so many different features but so much of aging is about debris you know build up of debris and what happens when you build debris up how you stop the flow of things that you need yeah my initial thought is uh what are the factors that lead to the fatty buildup and if you don't address those sure maybe you could mechanically remove it but if you haven't addressed the underlying root factors all right is a poor diet and sary lifestyle all right so now if you clean that up does the body then start to clean it up on its own uh and i bet that that that would probably be the case now there's probably a limit to that um but then it also becomes a matter of u what's the recipe for rejuvenating whether it's the immune system or other cell types that would clean the debris out yeah right i look at i don't necessarily look at it from a top down where you give these drugs but how can you stimulate the body to endogenously do it on its own which it does at a younger age and just does it less well at older ages it's reprogramming again it's reprogramming and you're right you know i i can see pathways through where we can clean debris um one of the things that was really good was was that if we give large doses of statins we clear some of the debr behind the eye the trouble is you know the maximum dose of statins in the uk is 80 milligrams and i think it was 150 milligrams you had to give people before that happened there are problems about giving people vast quantities of statins you are right but you're you're you you i think ideology may get in the way of where you want to be because i don't i don't see how the i don't see how it's reprogramming and i don't even know what to reprogram you know um um and i yeah it's reprogramming all right so then an argument against the mitochondrial theory of aging is uh evidence from saw 2 het heterozygous knockout knockout mice so if you knock out one copy of the saw 2 gene which is excl can't talk exclusively localized to mitochondria they don't have a shorter lifespan and they produce more hydrogen peroxy side so that would argue against in contrast sod one knockout complete knockout which is in the cytool they have a shorter average lif span shorter maximum lifespan reduce mitochondrial function increased oxidative stress which suggests that it's the oxidative stress in the cytool not necessarily in the mitochondria that may be may be the worst part of the story uh yeah but we you know we could we could sit here and we could talk about lots of things like that and you get overwhelmed i agree with you i agree with you you know and that science seems to me to be solid you know what do we do about what do we do about i mean i suppose it's it's it goes back to the cyto kind story ross you know ross we all started off thinking ross was really bad news you know ross actually can be pretty important can be pretty you know significant um as a protector um you know um yeah i mean i i i play around a lot with the idea of met forming you know know um but these are the wrong things that we need to reprogram yeah yeah by glenn that was great i appreciate you coming on and hopefully we can have you on again at at another time well you know i i've really we i said to the lab we've got to if if if if i stop doing science now we can carry on publishing for probably another five or seven years i've said that the aim of the lab must be now that we spend 25% of our time trying to get the story out taking the story to people who are influencers so healthc care people because there's no money in red light light bulbs there's no money in walking out in the in in the park um we've got to get the story out and so i really appreciate the fact that i've been invited onto onto your program it's it's important yeah well you don't know i guess but i'm a little bit of both so my phd of in physiology i've got a pretty i i mean not an ext as extensive as you uh pub meded uh you know citations but you know so i'm a little bit of both where i'm classically trained and educated as a scientist but i've got my my feed also in this world of uh trying to like you said promote you know the health aspects of so many things so but you're you're an anomaly in some ways because most scientists are not thinking about it like that they're it's very tunnel vision even even if you send i've heard you say on other podcasts you know i think you said uh on sundays you're responding to emails all day sometimes and it from my experience just dealing with scientists for 20 years 15 to 20 years post phd just getting an email response on a simple question from someone in your field can be either they they don't respond they don't check it or they don't care which is obscenely disrespectful so i agree you're fantastic and that you're the opposite of that and i think if there are any junior scientists that are watching or people that are thinking about getting into science and pursuing a phd you're a great example even talking about responding to as many people as possible i do the same thing on youtube i'm responding to comments almost everybody if i can even on emails everywhere i want to help and promote you know health as much as i can so i appreciate this mindset that you put out there about that no we've we've got to get that mindset and i do spend i do try and answer every email you know because you get an email from someone you know in some small town in arizona it's important to them it's really important to them um so and and you know taxpayers pay my salary so yeah yeah yeah great anyway yeah thank you so much no thank you glenn all right and we'll talk again soon cia yeah okay take care bye bye
