# Testosterone Declines During Aging: What's My Data?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible as a strategy for potentially slowing aging so with that in mind what's optimal for testosterone well testosterone declines during aging and to illustrate that point we'll take a look at three studies and these studies are done in men in the first study which included about 12200 people we've got total levels of testosterone on the y- axis plotted against age on the x with 24 year olds to 40 to 41 year olds included in the study and then in youth we can see that testosterone levels were about 650 nanograms per deciliter whereas in people older the 40 to 41 year olds it was lower at 580 nog per deciliter but what about older than 41 years old so that's what we'll see here and this is a study of about 2 200 people on the wa axis we've got total testosterone this time in nanomolar no worries i'll convert that into nanograms for deciliter in a second and then that's plotted against age on the x but this time from birth through 80y olds and here we can see that testosterone levels peak in youth in the teenage years somewhere around 30 nanom or 865 nanograms per deciliter but then there's an age related decline such that 80-year-olds have about half that level 435 nanog per decer in the third study we'll see similar data and note that this is a study of about 3200 people and these are this is morning testosterone and that's important because testosterone levels measured measured later in the day are lower relative to morning values in this study it went from 25 year olds to older than 75 and we can see that testosterone levels declin from 18 to about 15 nanomolar and note that these are not the absolute concentrations you can see that it says geometric mean so these are concentrations adjusted for covariates age bmi etc but nonetheless we can still see that there's an age related decline for testosterone which brings us to what's my data so this is for the october 9th blood test test that corresponds to blood test number six in 2023 as i also measured total testosterone and on that day it was 746 nanograms per deciliter so to put that into perspective we can see that for my chronological age i'd be somewhere there which would be an outlier above the range expected for my chronological age an argument can also be made to that this is what one would expect to find in youth now i'm not going to make that that much of a big claim but at the worst it would be higher than what's expected based on chronological age which would be somewhere around 550 nog per deciliter or 19 nan nanomer now i can already hear the comment section blowing up what about free testosterone and i didn't measure that for this test that'll be on the next test which will be in late november so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video sometime in december all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics nad quantification epigenetic and tiir testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing which includes apob using a complimentary profile sciox health to the atome metabolomic kit green tea die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as shown here that link and all of the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day he
