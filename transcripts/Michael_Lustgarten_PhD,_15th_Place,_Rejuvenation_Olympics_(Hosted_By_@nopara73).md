By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Conquer aging or die trying most people want to talk about the first one but i want to talk about the second part of that sentence here so you can interpret it in two ways one is that you died trying to conquer aging you died and failed but the other is that you died because you tried because you tried so hard so what do you mean by that so it's the first i i don't think it's the i i'm trying my best to avoid the second so uh i can't stand the idea of aging i can't stand the idea of functional decline and everything that goes with it increase disease risk increase mortality rate for every year that we live uh past a certain age um so i'm trying to do everything i can you know uh everything in the scientific literature to my own biohacking pursuits tracking the correlations where if i do die and i say if because just because everyone that's ever lived has died doesn't mean it will always be like that eventually the knowledge of what we know in terms of aging there is some there is some slope to that right are we down here where it's flat we know basically nothing we're just primitive monkeys in the jungle throwing rocks of stuff hoping that it works maybe but the rate of aging is a constant so how close are we to matching those slopes right uh i don't know how close um and the way i look at it is is kind of like the 300 spartan view i i'm going to die trying uh doing everything i physically can um as much brain capacity that i have bandwidth uh to try to not die right so now the other side of that equation is what interventions are you doing and are you doing no harm and actually improving the cause or getting yourself closer to death because you're trying you know things that are haven't been approved fda approved or they're just asn't scientific literature on it you're just taking a leap so i try to minimize that risk by focusing almost exclusively on diet and supplements and other prescriptions with a demonstrated need so i think that's the lowest risk approach whereas others are taking 100 supplements 150 supplements trying all kinds of crazy stuff and i say crazy maybe it's not crazy maybe i'm just behind the time so to me that would minimize my risk of this i died trying because of what i was doing versus i died trying where i took the lowest risk approach that should have given me the most most gains you know i'm sure you know just as one last point there's a guy named uh aaron trewick who was in this space kind of but he was in more of the biohacker side and not maybe necessarily understanding the science of it as much so whether he overdosed on ketamine in a float tank or was trying some kind of intervention aim to improve improve his health uh he died in his 20s so i'm trying to avoid that fate with everything that i do you know there was there was a famous bodybuilder i don't remember who who was training other bodybuilders later on and he told to one of his trainers his bodybuilder that if you want to be mr olympia don't ask me to site anything like that's not how people become mr olympia right like there is a huge amount of bro science out there and they have to well die trying anyway um along those lines so there is no one siiz fits-all prescription right and what works in the published literature doesn't necessarily work at the individual level so you may have a randomized control trial of 50 100 pick your sample size you know the larger the sample size the closer you would expect to be representative of population based average that should work for most people but the fact is and this is where i see the frontier of individualized precision nutrition precision medicine is does what works for other people work for me and if not what will work for me so the idea of the bodybuilder saying don't ask me to cite anything that kind of goes to that to this point what is the individual prescription what works for you may not work for me if beta kerene is associated with higher alamin for you for i work with cl clients who it's the opposite in their data their correlations are actually the opposite so i don't try to push anyone towards uh my diet or my supplements or lack of supplements i work with people who have a completely different diet who try to supplement the heck out of everything um you know it's all about following the data though you know what do your biomarkers say what can we do to improve specific biomarkers and you know biomarkers of organ and systemic function uh and it's personalized right but it takes a lot of data to get to that point you know someone's got to be willing to test you know six seven eight times per year over and over year after year um in order to see what do the correlation show [music] right michael garden welcome to the show thanks adam i have been very excited to to host you in fact i have been probably the most excited to host you because what you're doing is what brian joneson aspires to do right like follow the data ddd datadriven development every color must fight for his life and you're doing that and your data is actually out there and you're showing people how you're deriving your conclusion i would like to go on a little bit of methodological philosophy and and then i will give back the ver to you because what what this is going to be about at least in the beginning is about your methodology because that is unique that is something that very few people are willing to do and even if they are willing to do they still cannot so i want to talk about mathematics uh physics biology and economics in mathematics we have some oxom and based on those oxom we can derive a lot of things those are applicable to reality now in physics we now have the ability to to actually test stuff and then we start testing stuff with the scientific method and we get to the conclusion based on our repeated tests when we are starting to go to biology we are we're still doing doing that we are still testing stuff but we are starting to have problems with the causation there because because coition doesn't even exist but uh that's a that's a that's a completely that's that's another philosophical uh musing there but in biology not everything happens all the time how it's being tested and then we even move to move on to economics then we are starting to realize that well you cannot have experiments these are n of one experiments these big things in economics happens only once and then what people have figured the austrian economics have figured is that well let's just take the the grant truth of economic the grant truths of economics supply demand and build an axiomatic systems out of that and now we're back to mathematics so where you lie on that spectrum is is is somewhere your you are an n of one experiment and and a very regul rigorous one of that so so so so what what you're doing as far as i understand is that you take note of everything that your doing in your life what you're eating what you're your your workout when you're sleeping everything and then you're trying to find correlations in between between these actions and based on that coloration you're building your learnings so just to contrast that to let's say dave pasco who is more like the around and find out guy well i don't have a question there but i think you have a lot of thoughts based on what i just said yeah so so i don't know i don't know that dave is so much in the uh f around find out uh camp even though he takes a lot of supplements um i think he i think he's so first of all he lives life like he travels all over the world and and does all kinds of quote unquote fun stuff and i put that in quotes because i'm a different kind of guy i think i'm oh god with without trying to sound egotistical i'm happy to be like a nickola and just be in isolation for most of my life working at the science of this and if that means i've sacrific the social aspect of it when considering i was never socially you know popular you know amongst the masses i'm okay with that so he lives life and i appreciate him and that mindset but i think i think he's gotten to the point where he's played around with his own data for so long that it's um seeing what sticks and keeping keeping it there and and throwing out what what might not now is there lot of noise in there like because 150 supplements there's got to be some noise same the same thing could be true for brian who's taking about 100 supplements you know i don't know but um i wouldn't put i wouldn't put him in the fround find out boat in terms of uh in terms of his data right so so yes so we got a lot of things to touch on so one yes i put all of my data out there not all of it i mean i've got the raw data on my side but you know i've got correlations with lots of stuff on patreon i post a lot of that on youtube and i did that and and i will continue to do that uh on purpose because you know brian's got a team of of at least an md i don't know what other scientists he has on his team but i'm sure that he can communicate with anybody that he wants to who's got uh you know credentials and education in this field so he's got a i'm sure he's got a pretty smart team but i think i think limiting yourself to only a few people and and that's great for him i'm not trying to knock his approach i think limiting yourself to only a few people in it is a you i don't pretend to have all the answers i may know what i know i may have a lot of knowledge on what i know but i don't pretend to know everything and i think great ideas can come from anywhere from phds from high school educated high school dropouts whomever man woman pick pick your pick your you know so i in the beginning it was like i'm going to put this out there and there may be areas i'm deficient in let's see right so i've gotten plenty of comments i try to read every comment on youtube i post everywhere reddit linkedin i'm posting everywhere i'm looking at comments from everywhere you know good bad and the ugly can i get more insight beyond what i already know and in many cases that's true so it's uh for me i see it as an open source kind of thing where you know i'm potentially helping the community and they're potentially helping me now maybe it's not a fair trade maybe i'm helping more than they're helping me i don't care doesn't matter i see it as an equ an equal partnership so okay then also in terms of uh statistical rigor right so proving ca causation which as you know is a whole another can of worms in itself i generally don't go after this is what caused this and the reason i say that especially when you're looking at uh 100 different variables for each biomarker and now if i'm looking at 30 biomarkers you know you do 100 time 30 you've got 3,000 comparisons right with a false discovery rate of just 0.05 there's going to be a lot of false positives in that data set i don't know which ones are false positives so if i impose an fdr you know an extra level of statistical rigor on just beyond the unadjusted correlations i'm potentially throwing out important correlations that i wouldn't know and then i may only follow those correlations that are significant at a certain threshold but i may be missing most of the other story so for now i've used the unadjusted correlation based approach if i have 10 nominally you know p value less than 0.05 for example 10 or 15 or 20 whatever it is significant correlations with a given biomarker and then a subset of that are significantly correlated across the net of 30 or so biomarkers i'll follow those correlations so for each test i may have four or five different interventions that i'm doing at once now mo for most people who are classically trained in science they'll say that's stupid you need to do one intervention at a time and do that 10 times and then take the intervention away and then see if you get a result but how am i going to generate 20 blood tests how will my arms how will my veins look you know i'll be like a heroin addict every i don't want to do that i'm not trying to right so i i found that the correlation based approach over a long period of time as i've been doing this since 2015 i've got now 50 plus blood tests and following the the correlations at the top of the heat and then trying those interventions okay i've got these five foods or nutrients that suggest hire this okay let's try it next blood test comes around i recalculate the data if they were true or involved in that story their correlation should stay relatively strong if they were not a part of that story their correlation will weaken other stuff will pop up and i continue to iterate that process over and over and over until i get to the point where i'm like okay here is the foundation of my macros my micros um fiber intake now here are some weak spots what can i do without blowing up the full system because that seems to push everything towards youth and lower all cause mortality risk what can i do to optimize some of these weak spots without blowing up the full core so that's where i am now with that approach as you know i've optimized a lot of stuff towards youth at least right now but i do have weak spots so in terms of people tracking right so that market has exploded over the past 10 or so years right you've got people wearing fitness trackers you've got people tracking their diet which is a market size of about 20 million people you've got people tracking sleep the problem now is it's not generally integrated across measures like you do have some companies uh fitness you know the you know you'll have blood testing companies that are link with the fitness tracking stuff but um you know and then even the recommend recommendations that they make aren't generally very good so i'm actually in development uh uh with an app right now to um basically bring my simple correlations based approach to the masses so anybody that's tracking diet and has a few blood test they can start to look at their own correlations um which saves an an immense amount of time it's like seven to 10 hours of work every time i get a blood test so we'll be able to get that data within you know minutes so i'm working on building towards those tools where people can do it much faster um and analyze their own data or come to me if they want some help are you developing the app what in what language uh i don't know i'm not i'm not a developer i don't have the coding tools like you and and your community i'm i say it all the time i'm coding stupid i've tried to learn r and my brain is just not structured or hasn't been up until this point i don't know what language they're using i i can i can find out we've got two developers that are uh that are kickass or my limited ability to you know i'm not a coder so i can't really comment on how good or not they are right but from my limited perspective they're kickass coders but i'll find out what language that they're coding in you see don't don't think so low of yourself because i have met people who do not code but they know what they want and their code looks they might not use the best practices right but their code looks something that i can understand and that is that is great that that is all i want from a code to understand i have an idea let's write some code so the very first programming lesson that i've ever got is about um making some coffee or tea i don't remember which one maybe both and i had to write down that what i'm going to do with the t the first thing and turns out that recipe is an algorithm so what i would like you to do now is to teach me how to do your method give me a this ste down algorithm on how to do your method let's assume i want to do that and and i don't want the entire stuff but i just want the the main stuff so what do i do it's pretty straightforward so um if you have one blood test you can't really do much with that um so let's just start with weighing all of your food right but then even tracking your supplements right so for let's say that there's a 50-day period in between blood tests day one blood test day 50 blood test so if you're tracking your dietary intake if you're tracking your average daily heart rate is a measure of how physically active or how much stress that you know cumulative stress if you take that 49 day average in between blood tests that then lines up with the latter blood test so now each blood test has a set of variables that align so now you blood test another 50 days later now you have two sets of data two 49 or 50-day groups of data that you can compare just even using a two sample t test and for variables that change you can just go across the board macros micros supplemental intake uh hrv resting heart rate pick your variables of of interest to see what's different in the inputs and what's different in the outputs and maybe there are 10 things that have a significant nominally significant significant difference you know p value less than 0.05 nonetheless there are going to be some things are going to be different and then you have some hypothesis okay alumin went up these things changed is it positive if it's positive if i keep them high let's see what happens all right so then going from two tests for the next 50-day period or how however many days in between tests using that same approach for each subsequent test you have those inputs because you're tracking them the average intake for the full period now you have three tests and even though three tests isn't a lot to look at correlations you can still get a ballpark idea of stuff that may be related stuff that's completely unrelated the correlations will be flat um and there may be a lot of there's obviously not a lot of noise in that data but that's basically the guts of it tracking lining up the blood test data with the inputs with whatever you're tracking after two tests uh two sample t tests after three tests looking at just simple correlations um and then you know as i mentioned adding another layer of statistical rigor you know for some things i have 2,000 data points right like hrv resting heart rate because i've tracked body weight and a whole host of other metrics um knowing that body weight is a big uh strong it's strongly correlated with both hrv and restic heart rate if i'm looking at other factors that may be involved i adjust my model so i don't just look at simple correlations i look at um you know multivariate adjusted linear regression models which sounds like a fancy thing but it's just one step beyond the simple correlation so that's the approach that i've used it's uh pretty simple i'd say may i have a quick surfish question on on that so i just started doing a diet uh one week ago and it's rfl um high protein high fiber lowfat low carb my hrv and my resting cart it is amazing ever since but my blood pressure went up like i have high blood pressure now i don't know why shouldn't be that the opposite i'm even doing potassium calcium magnesium and even salt like i'm doing a bunch of supplementation so i i don't think it should be that so do you have any guesses what could happen well so that raises an interesting point right if a certain diet supplement or group of supplements or even prescription meds rap ay pick pick your you know pick your geroprotector or senolytic of choice if that improves one biomarker in isolation maybe that's great so not to you know poop on the keto crowd and the carnivore crowd and i'm open to every diet diet potentially being good for health you just got to show me the net sum of the data but a lot of people in that community will say well look at my markers of metabolic health glucose and lipids and then not show any other data so can you now maybe the other data is and they just don't show it for whatever reason but i try to look at the sum across a net of as many organ systems as possible so not just blood pressure but kidney function liver function inflammation metabolic health um lung function uh you know so like a forc expiratory volume right function during workouts right is if if you know your strength in a given set of movements is your strength better worse or the same right so so for your diet if that's the only thing that you changed i would take the check off the box across all of the biomarkers that you're checking does it seem to be a net positive if so uh that's good but then there are going to be things like you said your blood pressure that may not be positively infect uh impacted and in fact going in the other direction so then the question is what can you do within your current diet to positively impact blood pressure while still keeping the positive changes on everything else right so and i don't know what the answer is there that takes a lot more tracking okay okay no no no that's that's interesting it didn't even occur to me to try tr to somehow actually combat my blood pressure a quick a quick analogy along that like so one of my weak points is homoy right so homoy increases during aging it's basically a marker of hypomethylation um it's related to blood pressure and dementia risk all cause mortality so my values have been close to age expected for a few years probably for i think 20 tests in a row age expected data i've tried every methyl donor you can think of i don't have genetic uh methylation issues at least based on snips i've had values half of where they are now about 20 years ago so i've had this age related increase even though i've had a lot of positive impa impacts on other biomarkers i've tried you know the folate methyl b6 trimethyl glycine i've tried serin plus b6 every biochemical pathway that's been linked with homosysteine right so only recently i was able to make a dent now whether i can repeat that i don't know but again i'm not trying to blow up the rest of the system trying to make small changes to improve these weak spots while keeping everything else so one of those changes from my latest test was cutting mushroom inting so mushrooms as i'm sure you know spermine increases lipan in animal models fanine increases lipan in animal models and is related to neurod degeneration when its levels are low potentially important metabolite but that's a story for another day so mushrooms fiber nias and mushrooms are an allstar so i've been eating about 250 grams on average per day day for probably about 3 years which seems like a lot but who knows how much is too much or what is the dose right what dose is optimal for just food right so mushrooms have nasin nasin comes in two main forms nicotinamide nicotinic acid so i've had problems with nad being relatively low and also age expected or worse but yet my niin intake is two and a half times the rda so how do you square that circle how can i have 2 and a half times the rda for a nutrient that's known to increase nad how does that make sense so i know that nicotinic acid in my case raises nad even very low dose so then that argues that mushrooms may not contain nicotinic acid they may contain nicotinamide now the reason why that's important is is because nicotinamide raises homocystine more than nicotinic acid that's been shown in at least one randomized control trial all right so then i've got the hypothesis if that's true and i cut mushroom intake down not eliminate it because i still want some orine and spermine and fiber and everything else magnesium all the other great things it has if i cut it down will i see a change on homosysteine and if so that even just 10 milligram per day change um of nicotinamide may have been causing higher homosysteine well my homosysteine went from an average of about 10 micromolar for 20 consecutive tests to a value that i've only seen with high high do b12 by cutting a nine microl not a big difference but it's my lowest value of 20 tests whether that's mushrooms i don't know i'm going to keep mushrooms down from 250 to about 995 grams per day all of the other biomarkers didn't change for now i don't know about epigenetics or uh deden pace tiir length i don't know what happened there but forino ag and albumin and glucose inflammation none of those went in crazy directions so i basically kept the core and potentially improved one biomarker without blowing up the system so so i so that going back to your data it's a matter of finding which aspects of your diet could be causing the blood pressure increase and i don't know what it could be that's something you'd have to track and look at correlations over time okay uh by the way that's a beautiful story um it's um well it's it's it's a lot of work to figure things like that out and you're not going to get things from from from research um in fact in fact when i first started on this journey it was what does the published data say let me try it and i had incredible hope that these things that have been published to work in other people would work in me for example my liver enzymes uh which just using the reference range not even focusing on what's optimal in terms of risk of death for all causes which i find more valuable uh the reference range generally for liver enzymes as alt is 0 to four for a period in the beginning i had liver enzymes for both a alt that were for 36 37 38 and above 40 now i'm not an alcohol drinker i mean i'm not opposed to it but it's almost never for the past 15 years so that wasn't it um because alcohol is well known to you know induce liver induce liver damage high levels of liver enzymes all right so then you've got milk thistle right this is the pop culture and there is some published evidence for it right okay let's try it didn't do a thing high fructose fructose is known to damage the liver as its met abiz in the liver my diet had about twice as much fructose as it does now i cut the fructose intake didn't do a thing green tea high do uh egcg which is found in green tea has been shown at least supplemental form uh but i was drinking probably uh four times as much green tea then as now so i tried cutting my green tea intake didn't make a dent on the liver enzymes so there are a lot of people who are using published studies and then doing a given intervention or or trying something saying oh worked there i'm good it worked there i'm good there and not actually testing that's the one thing that i stress without bias is test we need to test we don't need to re rely on studies in other people we need to test ourselves we need to test ourselves often and it's only through that approach that we can get closer to what the truth you know the uh the the recipe the the the the driver's manual for optimal operation of our machine you know i create two challenges for you but you've already overcome the first one without me even saying it so let's just move on to the second your eting in a way that every calor must fight for its life but you're trying to do this with whole foods even though the logical conclusion if you would really take that goal to its extent would be that you should try to do it with the most isolated supplements because well that has the least amount of calorie and you're not going to get uh get saturated fat in let's say selenium supplements instead of um what's that nut brazilan nut right so what do you say to that yeah so there are two things there one is i prefer targeted supplementation with a demonstrated need which is basically a a medicine mindset right you have a given disease you have high blood pressure we're going to give you a diuretic right you have demonstrated problem what's the what's the solution so i'm not completely opposed to supplements so i have experimented you know with as i mentioned high dose higher dose folly b12 b6 uh i took five grams of supplemental bcaas to test homosysteine i do things with demonstrated need that are up to a point resistant by diet right just as another example um so for whatever reason or maybe it's because i took antibiotics like candy candy pills as a kid so my mom i you know i i was sick as a kid for whatever reason you know my mom went to the doctor got me some penicillin penicillin bottle went went on the shelf when i was in a relatively young age i learned how to unscrew that screw top which is supposed to be resistant to children and and i was like i don't feel well today i'm going to take some p penicillin i don't know if that's the reason for it but i've got um relatively elevated candida igg antibodies that go back to 2017 so in 2017 i forgot about it i thought oh whatever cares doesn't matter but i started testing that more often in 2024 four tests so far and each test has been higher than than it should be it's outside of the range so what's causing that right so i tried to look at correlations over four tests and the long story short is uh you know the f round find out is one side of the story the died trying because maybe i wasn't open to you know for example if i have cancer and my going to say hey i'm going to track correlations with diet for 20 tests over the next three years and see if i can beat cancer or am i going to do chemo and everything else in the rapid short term right so there's a balance there between i need to fix these things asap all right so candida is something i want to fix asap i don't want to f around and find out anymore this has been at least a problem since 2017 it could be something that goes back 30 years so i uh worked with a doctor yesterday and rapa m's on the way i'm going to do that experiment so now we've got what does rapid m do to my data and because i've got 50 plus blood tests i'll be able to see if it does something to candida as it's a known antifungal it's known eliminate candida at least in vitro rcts are limited but um you know so i'm not opposed to the supplements and and ger protectors it's just demonstrated need and things that are resistant by diet now to add one last bit to that story it you know it goes to the lowest risk if it yes every calorie is fighting for its life in my approach but that that that mindset also suggests some amount of um you know my diet sucks i'm not happy with it you know i have to you know so that's not it at all all of the foods in my current approach have come there by you know trial and error but also because i like them and i feel satiated almost exclusively on this approach could i eat pizza and ice cream for sure and after a blood test i do eat some of that junk and it's interesting like i generally don't have problems with uh satiety where i'm like god i got to eat ravenously like that i haven't had that issue fortunately knock on wood for a few years but on the days when i have cheat meals immediately after a blood test when my fiber intake is at least half of what it generally is i really have to use some willpower to say all right don't over eat today and and i think fiber and and and the approach is a big part of that so uh anyway going back to the point of each calorie fighting for its life and why not why not just supplementing with it there's something about food matrix now whether that actually is involved in optimal health i don't know but i i just think getting it from whole foods trying to get it as much from whole foods as possible whereas taking all of it via supplement i think the whole food based approach is the lowest risk based approach you know so polypharmacy in older adults is not generally associated with better health now granted poly pharmacy being they're taking numerous amounts of medications for various health related conditions so is it so different where you've got someone who's generally healthy and they're taking 100 supplements fast forward 50 years now they're generally older taking 100 supplements are those supplements now good within the context of aging or you know what is the net effect right so i try to limit as much supplements as possible trying to get the diet to optimize it as much as i can with the thinking that that's the lowest risk b based approach but even on a whole food-based diet you know i guess i don't know if uh steve jobs was a fruitarian you know for most of his life or just did that once he was diagnosed with cancer but you know even on a whole food-based diet it may not be optimal like what is an optimal di you know so another thing i have another thought here right for the longest time the idea was eat real food and exercise and forever i've thought that that's just not good enough what is the evolution of that approach so within a whole food-based approach how much protein how much fat what micros micronutrients right so and then how do you even address those questions right so i try to get closer to that with whole foods still thinking that that will be the lowest risk b based approach uh but even on a whole food based approach it can be negative if you go too far in one direction or you know or the other um let's take a person a normal person right he is not taking supplements and not eating healthy okay now let's give that normal person some supplements some some some vitamin multivitamin fish oil and and vitamin d that's enough so that person that normal person is healthier would you agree that's normal person is healthier than the one who wouldn't take any anything yeah maybe not and then i'd say i'd have to see the data but in terms of the foundations of health i think the foundations are what what you hear everybody say and it's cliche but it's pretty much true uh sleep quality and duration short sleep being bad very very long sleep also being potentially bad um short short sleep can impact things like metabolic health and glucose levels so if someone's not paying attention to sleep quality and duration things like slow wave sleep which decline during aging or the percentage of slow wave sleep which decline during aging and that's involved in dementia risk so sleep is a humongous part of this approach so if the person who's just taking some supplements doesn't improve sleep the other side of it is regular exercise you know now even there it comes to prescription how often at what intensity for how long um because exercise is a stressor if you're running if you're not conditioned to it and you run a marathon you'll feel terrible for a pretty long time after you ran that marathon right like david goggins talked about how he had bones broken in his foot or something like that and he ran like a 100 miles or did some ultramarathon right so exercise is a stressor the question is frequency dose intensity so getting that getting those right beyond just exercise a certain amount every week is a big part of the approach but then even when it comes to diet diet is another foundation you know like as i mentioned you know macros and micros and how many calories right calorie restriction even i i don't think we have to go to 25 30 40% like the animal models to get big increases in health or lifespan uh in terms of cr in my case it's like a mild restriction over a long period of time where the net effect on the biomarkers is like 10 biomarkers out of about 30 going in the right direction versus wrong in terms of how they should look in terms of aging or all cause mortality risk so leanness whe in part by mild to moderate cr in conjunction with regular exercise training year over year week to week you know for a long period of time um so for me these are the foundation now how much will supplements add to that i don't know but i'd bet that someone that's lean has very little level low low levels of visceral fat who's highly functional doesn't have to be a the2 max of 60 it could be something lower than that but above average fitness and consistently gets good sleep quality and duration where you're avoiding that age related decline for slow wave sleep i bet that that's at least a 20-year gain um in average lifespan now does i get you to 120 and beyond who knows well adding supplements and rap ayin and geroprotector analytics on top of that add to it that's where we have to get into the testing you know so you know for example if my albumin is what you'd expect to find in a 20-year-old five or glucose is in the 80s which is what you'd expect to find in a 20-year old crp is below the li limit of det hs crp below the limit of detection if i'm taking rap ay and i've already got the majority of my biomarkers are youthful how's it going to impact my lifespan further now if it impacts things that like candida which could potentially shorten lifespan or other microbes that may be uh accumulating that i don't know of okay maybe that's a benefit but i prefer to see the quantified approach to someone's got the foundation down they're taking a given supplement or drug or prescription whatever it may be and now they see a further improvement in certain metrics okay i'm with that but for the generally healthy person who has not optimized the foundation or isn't trying to optimize diet exercise sleep i don't know how much it helps in fact maybe it could be even detrimental because maybe they're mega doing stuff that they wouldn't ordinarily see on a normal diet maybe it's not in the in the format that you would get from food maybe it's you know i don't know because some of these things are not in the same maybe you get a form of b12 in a supplement that you're not getting in food right and then you've got the food matrix which helps with absorption and other stuff right so i can't say with any certitude that someone taking just supplements in general without the foundation would be good good good for health okay that's where i was going with it so okay first of all i would like to just note that that getting my grandma to take a pill every day will will cost her i can't do that by the way i can't get her but it would be infinitely easier than getting her to exercise or sleep well or eat well right so anyway so we have the person who's not doing anything we have the person who's taking some basic supplements and you're saying that well we're not quite sure if it's making any difference but there is a third person here who is taking supplements based on data so we don't really have those kind of people who are like rigorously measuring but having bad sleep bad exercise bed everything but taking the right amount of supplements to get how did you say optimize yourself into the into the optima range something something like that so that's that's that's an idea for a supplement company right um and and then and then the question is what's the what's the test so let's build a supplement company uh what's what's the test here you can have regular blood test which is quite problematic that's a very bad user experience you know you have to go to a doctor and uh maybe in the us it's easier but in hungary um the the the the medical bureaucracy is impossible to navigate even if you just want to get a single blood test so but there is something else called epigenetic tests which are also trying to tell you they can tell you the same things what a blood test can't tell you and that's just i'm getting there don't worry i know that you've done you've done you've tested them so i i want to ask about that but you know they don't even claim because i've talked with brian ryan uh ceo of through that they are not allowed to legally tell you a bunch of things that they probably know because then they would be medical services and what not bureaucracy government encroachment on people uh usual story the the point is that they in theory would be able to tell you stuff and now the question is how accurate those things are right and you've done those tests and i've heard you say that well i've done those tests the same day and then they didn't really correspond but um there is an argument there is an argument there and i would like to ask you about this argument so i've heard the true diagnostic people saying that it is possible they're not claiming that but it is possible that the epigenetic tests are better than the blood tests because what the blood tests are showing you is more more fluctuating dayto day but what the epigenetic fingerprints are telling you is on a longer time frame what was your experience in in in this all right so we got two thoughts here that i want to address the first is um so my niche generally everybody has a niche right i wish i could i could uh have you know i don't know 300 million followers on instagram or whatever it may be because the masses all know about right 300 million people know and appreciate and love what i do that's not the case my niche is um and people with that i work with is they're highly motivated they're willing to track they're willing to blood test and this generally is not the average population right this is at i don't want to say the far right side of the the normal distribution but these are the high high motivated highly motivated people ceos execs etc now can i can i convince people who are above average intelligence to get closer to the far right side of the normal distribution maybe can i convince the average person off the street who doesn't care anything about diet or exercise or sleep to optimize their health generally not that's a very difficult uh and there are plenty of other people in this space who are who who that's their niche right so and that's okay that's just you know what can you do right so and it's like that in any business you know you have people who politically lean a certain way you have people who diet lean a certain way my niche is my niche okay now second is um and i'm okay with that it is what it is that said going back to the grandma who maybe she doesn't exercise or eat well um or sleep well i do think it is possible and obviously conventional medicine could attest to that right you have high blood pressure you take a diuretic blood pressure goes down there are certain things that do work for you know isolated situations in terms of improving health rated outcomes um now with the mindset of longevity does that does that translate right so i i'd say it could right so for example the stomach produces less acid during aging and as a part of that process is acid is required to uh have protein digest protein digestive enzymes to have maximal activity so protein digestive enzyme ity uh output declines during aging too in part because of the decrease in stomach acid output another aspect of aging that may be related to that is poor kidney function because if you're not digesting protein when it's in the stomach and absorbing it into the intestine more of it may make it to the large intestine where it's fermented by gut bacteria into potentially de deleterious metabolites that negatively impact kidney function now that happens during aging these metabolites increase during aging is it because older people are eating more protein generally not they're not eating more protein but to me it makes sense that older people may have a problem with acid secretion by the stomach and protein digestion with more more of it being fermented by gut gut bacteria now that's a relatively easy fix people could take in those in that situation you know there are acid supplements like b and hcl and others which can lead to an increase in stomach acidity at least within an hour at least based on published studies so someone's eating a high meat diet and they know they have problems with k function maybe taking some acid supplements in in conjunction with uh protein digestive enzymes whether it's pepsin or trin or whatever they can find that could potentially limit how much protein goes to the large intestine more of it absorbed into the blood could potentially impact muscle mass because now you're actually using it for what it can you know be used for you have less of these protein or amino acids in the gut where they're not going to be fermented into metabolites by bacteria that can negatively impact the kidney so now you've got to feed forward positive loop just based on one or two supplements and a targeted demonstrated need knowing that there's decreased kidney function during aging there's decreased stomach acidity during aging and decreased uh uh protein digestive enzyme output during aging so but in that situation i'd have to see your grandma's kidney function and other biomarkers related to that and her protein intake to see if she'd be a good candidate for that demonstrated need to just take those supplements because you're a certain age maybe your kidney fun is good and you're taking these supplements you don't need it it's just wasted energy and and money right so and i think a lot of people are in that situation where they take supplements and don't have any data and it's just basically hope you know it's uh i think it's going to work because it worked in animals i don't have any of my own data i'm good but i think that's a flawed approach and potentially dangerous that was the beginning of the the grandma story ah epigenetics so i'm a big fan of ryan and and uh hannah and true diagnostic big fan you'll never hear me say a bad word about them they are fantastic and i don't throw around superlatives easily um they're fantastic so uh in this i don't see this as an epigenetics vers standard blood test uh battle right so there's a i see it as a hierarchy right so at the top of the hierarchy is phys physical cognitive emotional health and function now as a part of that story is uh body composition right so percent body mass percent fat mass visceral fat mass bone density these are the top of the pyramid we want to have optimal levels of all of those and if there's any decrement in any of those things over time which are well known to happen more body fat more visceral fat less bone density etc something's wrong and because we can potentially intervene there but what's under the h and i think most people stop there right they look at the scale or or you know they go to the gym but the fact is most 70y olds even the most highly motivated people i should maybe 7 and early age most 85 year olds compared to where they were in their 20s less muscle mass less function etc right so but what's underlying that right so if you dig under the hood which is what i'm trying to do we can take it a step step by step you've got cells proteins and metabolites epigenetics and then dna now we can't control our dna right that's just the script for what can happen right and even if you've got uh a genetic risk for certain you know uh outcomes you know based on a few thousand snips all working together it's still a risk it's still a potential you would need that script in conjunction with diet and lifestyle to now really further assess risk which there are no studies as far as i know it's only here's your genetic risk for this given outcome but there's a lot more to that story so i place very little emphasis on what the genome is um even with demonstrated you know like okay you have the mt hr the the the methyl folate snip so maybe you'll have higher hom sy but then most people don't measure homosysteine you've actually got to look at the downstream measures so i see epigenetics as the you know the modification the methylation modification on dna as being as close to molecular as you can get it's an important part of the story in fact if everything at the top is optimized but the gen epigenetic stuff is not optimized that could be the early warning signal for example my horvath epigenetic age which i know that the true diagnostic team is not a fan of because they're better tests of all cause mortality risk horvaths is not it is the best clock for how old are you but who cares how old are you if it doesn't predict your mortality risk i see value in that because i don't want my my predicted age to be older than my chronological age it should be 18 years younger like feno age like the other standard blood test markers but it's not so i see the epigenetics is the early warning sign because if that data is aberant potentially other stuff up upstream the metabolites the proteins the cells will start to become aberant because if your gene expression is messed up as the epigenetics is uh a marker of are you having genes that are overexpressed or underexpressed so to me that's the ear the early warning sign and i include it in the approach because i don't want to leave any of these boxes unchecked you know i'm doing metabolomics i'm doing the cells you know so white blood cells red blood cells you know platelets all of that stuff and i'm also doing the big picture stuff physical physical function leanness you know bone mineral density so i see it as a part of the story i don't see it as a binary you know epigenetics or the other now i know people in this space are placing a lot of emphasis on tests like d and pace but it's only a part of the story you're number 15 on the rejuvenation olympics leaderboard and just for for for the listeners to to to see the comparison i am number 520 [laughter] so what are your statistics here so chronological age biological age based of aging longev we already said that and uh and have you got your symphony age results so not yet on the symphony age um it's very promising but even even uh and i guess i'm going to end up disagreeing with true diagnostic on this but the om age i'm not i'm not yet convinced about om age or symphony age even though they're both strongly associated with cause mortality risk don and pace is in the same ballpark so how much of a roi am i getting by using those two other tests versus the need and pace i don't know i i got a lot so so by the way um i i don't even know what my symphony age is but what i found it very interesting is that i always thought that i'm i'm overweight right and i my lungs are not great as well so i was not really sure like which ones are which one is the worse and it turns out my lungs are worse than how overweight i am and it it really ended up in a way that i have very good genetics in terms of heart health and i am in the top i was 13 in in in the heart stuff and 16 in the muscle stuff in symphon age but heart and and metabolic health was terrible so it did highlight to me that you know i i do workout properly for five years didn't skip a workout but but not eating properly right so it gave me a lot of lot of value that hey these are the things that i should focus on and just just don't worry about other things because these things are breaking right now okay so what's what's your d p yeah wait hang on wa so along those lines and uh again i i love and appreciate true diagnostic i i'm a huge fan of them but um just to push back is so for example the lung prediction that say dna methylation prediction of your lung function now granted the the data was probably trained on people who actually measured lung function and then they looked at marker genes that were associated with the actual lung function whatever the value whatever there are many ways to assess lung function to physically assess it rather than the prediction of it so it seems like i'm tiptoeing on both sides of the fence where i appreciate the epigenetic predictions but then on the other side i'm kind of uh saying that maybe the epigenetic predictions in all cases are not the best way to assess some kind of outcome so for example i've actually measured my lung function and i have a spirometer which nothing too crazy expense of h hundred and something dollars usd measuring it every week not three times a week and i'm able and and three day three days per week but um so i'm not doing it every day but i've done that for now since 2022 it declines during aging your forced expiratory volume declines during aging now am i going to place more value on an epigenetic prediction of that metric or the physical actual measure so for example to the fit age is also a dna methylation prediction of your strength or some fitness measure i actually measure my strength at every workout so for some things there may be value um for others be more direct for example i can't measure tm length as as a physical thing sure i could use like other other methods that are a close approximation to tm length as a cellular measure so true diagnos true diagnostic is using a dna methylation based estimation of tm length which isn't the actual t length measure but there is published data that the tna methylation based estimation of tm length may be a better metric relative to the actual measure measurement of t length so for some things the epigenetic estimation of a given outcome may be better whereas for examp i can't measure tm length physically but for physical measures that i can measure i look at the physical measures i i don't you know i don't need someone to or i don't need a test to say your fitness age is this apologies for people in the language mf or i can actually measure my fitness age physically i can measure it i don't need a prediction of it i need a prediction of the things that i can't physically measure right all right so denit and pace uh it seems like i'm i'm uh bringing out the negativ a little bit of negativity so i think brian's team or maybe in conjunction with true diagnostic i don't know so to get on to the leaderboard you need it's your best three tests over two years i i don't like that approach even if it puts me at number 15 great because the fact is i have year-to-year data and it's not based on three tests so i have 15 tests since 2022 now i only have three tests in 2022 maybe that's not enough data for a year a full year average in 2023 a tested eight times and thus far i have data for four tests in 2024 so i i see more value in looking at an eight-year average in 2023 versus a four test average a 48 test average in 2023 versus a four test average in 2024 or maybe you just take my 15 test average since 2022 to right maybe that's more representative of three tests because when you do that my average den and pace over 15 tests is 82 so i actually think i should be lower on the list now would other people be lower on the list too if we took all of their data and track it versus their best data i don't think you just take your best data anyway so that that's my spiel on that yes my best data puts me number 15 but if we took my average i'd be a bit lower that said though the need pace increases during aging so if we look at the three tests in 2023 eight tests in 20 uh eight three tests in 2022 eight tests in 2023 and the four test in 2024 it has not increased in fact it's a little bit lower than where it was in 2022 so at worst i've resisted an age related increase when considering it increases during aging it gets harder for the people that you've interviewed like uh uh jeffrey gladen and some of the others that are older than me chronologically old older than me that have uh similar data it gets harder for someone of an older chronological age to have values of 06 whereas people of a younger chronological age like seaman and don't get me wrong i'm not knocking see i'm a huge fan of seaman huge fan he's he's gonna be humongous in this field for decades uh he's in his 20s so for him to have a0 66 i expect him to have that data or jville who's in her 20s i expect her to have data in their 20s for someone of an older chronological age brian who's you know still younger than me by a bit it gets harder so at worst or maybe at best for me i've resisted any age related increase over the past uh two plus years which is for me almost more informative than here are your best three tests over over two years but so so that's the denum pace just for some context to the listeners uh the previous region win olympics before the big update um the previous one had two lists one of the list was um the first one the first result the needan p result of yours compared to the next results and how much you're reducing compared to your first results so so that was not not not a great list because like that doesn't only incentivize you to improve it also incentivize you to have as bad first result as you can so so anyway uh they they removed that but the second one was actually wait by ages right so if you were 100 years old and you had a 0.7 thean pace then you were ranking higher even then a person who is only 30 years old and has a 0.6 theam pace so so so so that was that was that was actually something very informative here but here after the update what we got is just average dan paces and yeah the younger people have an advantage because of their chronological age so that that that raises an interesting point and i don't know if the true diagnostic uh peeps are going to listen or brian's team is goingon to listen whoever is responsible is going to listen maybe hopefully they do because i think you know discussing it and what's the best way to look at it is is important you know uh so i think the top of the leaderboard is going to be dominated as you mentioned by people not just who are chronologically young by women too right women live longer than men on average so i'd expect that women should have a slower epigenetic pace of aging relative to men at any chronological age so the top of the leaderboard should be chronologically young women right so but then you could so do you do you then have a gender specific you know uh or sex sex specific leaderboards two different leaderboards but then as you mentioned too chronological age right so then do we start to group it by chronological age range because someone like you know like someone who's chronologically 70 with a dita pace of point6 that's fantastic and should get more respect i don't know more respect whatever whatever respect that comes from that whatever street cred right it's important to highlight that you know so so that's another way to potentially look at it but the other side of that too as i mentioned is that year-to-year change um you know maybe there are people like so it's funny because uh i say i say i've got the secret sauce right i don't have i don't necessarily have the secret sauce yet and when you hear secret sauce you think what drugs you taking no that's not it at all but you know we touched on this earlier you know for the people that are taking every supplement on earth every every medicine on earth trying to biohack their way to the super longevity i've got the secret sauce and the secret sauce is the data you know because people who are just throwing the kitchen sink at whatever biomarker of choice um and are not actually tracking what they're doing maybe they'll have some success but i don't anticipate long-term success with a approach like that in contrast over 15 tests i haven't discovered the recipe for something like done and pace yet to get me down to6 in that range but based on other biomarkers it's only a matter of time and data collection so so for me that's the best approach now even without that yet i see age uh uh resisting age related uh increase so you know initially they had that percent uh uh reduction from your first test but then you'll have people that'll you know butch you know purposely butcher their first test you know just maybe you'll eat eight 8,000 calories a day before that can't result in a good duding and pace or maybe you do that for a week you end up with a denum pace of 1.5 or whatever 1.4 and then you really try hard and do all the right things and then it's 0.9 and then you have this 60% reduction you're at the top of the leaderboard for most improvement there is some value in that but you'll have people gaming the system right so i see value in looking at at resisting age related change right here's people's data that started tracking five years ago and they've seen no age related change five years later to me that's important right you're resisting an aging process right so absolute values in terms of the number is important or your best data is important but what's your data over time uh with way more than three tests i see that so we could do a four four different uh distinctions separation based on sex based on age year-to-year change best data over a given time period just want to want to throw in that maybe in the future technology gets so good that we don't really need to worry about the the the woman versus uh man distinction but but you know i just realized you're bringing the worst out of me because you're bringing the geest geek out of me because i am i am that and i i have been talking on bitcoin conferences and i realize myself when i'm start talking about utxos that oh no everyone lost me so i have an idea you have a lot of street cred now right number 15 so let's talk about you um what who who are you what what what got you here and then my first question is what's the adventure of your life so before answering both of those so technically i do fall into the geek category right but i think the stereotype of what a geek is is this you know glasses wearing frail sits in front of a computer crunched you know hunched back because of poor posture and doesn't care about anything aside from that esoteric knowledge i do fall into that category but you know without trying to flex too much i do i do have a little bit i do have a little bit of some guns right and i do have a six-pack right so uh i think i fall somewhat into the scientist warrior geek if i was going to define myself now i don't know warrior how how much of a warrior i am but uh i do have some of those genetics where if i if i train jiu-jitsu and uh taekwondo as a kid which i didn't but i just don't have the time to do it now i'm taking teo right now you're taking it right now i i actually only do it for one week but every day twice yeah so the some of the taekwondo spin kicks and and side kicks front kicks back that's a part of my approach part of it for the fun but also for like you know uh hip mobility it's great for you know addressing different planes of movement so anyway i do fall into the geek category but for those who don't know i had to you know i don't want to have to take my shirt off but there are shirtless piics of me all over the internet you know and i'm lean you know so i don't think i fit the classic geek stereotype where i'm just some nerd behind a desk you know i'm a little bit of other stuff too i've always been interested in optimal health and fitness uh i grew up on bodybuilding magazines back when magazines were actually a thing when i was a kid and i had the thought like you know uh sounds terrible it somewhat uh you know sex ist i guess i don't know whatever the word is to say but i always thought like the big dudes the fit dudes they always get the hottest chicks i always thought that right that's always been a thing of mine so whatever uh so i was like i want to be i want to be fit and strong i want i want all the women to to to to be physically and sexually attracted to me so since since i was i don't know 12 13 you know i was a part of the gym life right going to the gym often getting fit and staying lean i really didn't know anything about optimal health and nutrition i every diet and supplement and you know pill under the sun uh and then in my 20s i got to the point the point where i was just like i i don't know anything about this and i want to so i read a book by dr roy walford who uh wrote beyond the 120y year diet and once i read that book uh the light bulb went off and you know the the lack i suffered from a lack of initiative and motivation and drive through my mid 20s terms of life goals and passion and what's my purpose what's my value uh but once i once i read his book the light bulb went off i want to study aging i want to study the metabolomics and the biomarkers uh i want to know about calorie restriction i want to be optimally fit for as long as physically possible now he died at 80 um he was cr for a big part of his life but there are other parts of his lifestyle that may not have been optimal that may have contributed to his demise that's a story for another day but uh that got me into i need to go back to school i needed to learn hardcore biochemistry i need to learn about physiology that's where i got i did my phd so i i basically got got took all the courses to get a biochemistry degree got into grad school where uh the focus was on aging one of the best places to study aging at the time with the goal of studying aging as a scientist and then the rest is history you know i've been in academia for the past uh you know since uh 2003 uh so i'm probably going to get out sooner rather than later to focus on doing this stuff for you know myself and others full-time um so yeah so that's how how i got into it what about your tribes uh both meat space and cyber space um what kind of people are you surrounding yourself yeah that's an interesting question i'd say most of my tribe is cyber based that's so i'm i'm an odd monkey i've always been an odd monkey i i've always had a time fitting in with uh you know general society the things i'm interested in most people are not interested in um and when i start talking about things that i'm interested in i get the he's a weird dude and all this stuff but online it's always been you know it's kind of like and you know again i'm trying not to be egotistical but it comes off i hope it doesn't come off as that but there's a line in the matrix which i love all the matrix movies and then you'll let people who say i like the first one and hated the others but every one of those i can relate to but there's a line where smith says to you know it seems to be you're living two lives this one live you got this and this other live you've got that right so uh the cyber world has always um attracted me more because now i can relate to people internationally who share similar interests uh regardless of geographical location and and uh i'm grateful for that i don't know where my mental health would be if uh i haven't developed that over the past 15 or so years so the majority of my stuff is s the majority of my interactions with people and friendship are are cyber based that said too i generally it's hard hard to get me out in person i'm not the type to go traveling the places just to see places if i would for example if i'm g to go somewhere like you know anarat in cambodia you know so to see some of these giant megalithic structures that exist all over the world which i'm interested in i wouldn't just go there as a tourist and take pictures and selfies in front of these things like most people do hey look at me i'm i'm looking pretty in front of ankko it's just not my thing i'd want to be at ankko wat and taking pictures of things that nobody's paid attention to for maybe thousands of years i'd want to be excavating thousands of feet under the so i'm back to the scientist mindset right so uh so most people uh in real life irl don't generally relate to that you know they just want to do their superficial stuff so and i'm okay with that that's my niche but so anyway it's generally hard to get me out in a social setting and i wasn't always like that it's just um i try to i try to have my time be most used valuably with with people who appreciate that time and vice versa where i appreciate their time where it's an equal value addition where i'm gaining something from them and they gain something for me so that's how i see social interactions now in real life and cyber based so if if the in real life stuff it's just some general social function i'll decline or won't go or try to get out of it as fast as i can uh for better or worse right are you spiritual and or religious yeah i appreciate the questions adam i do these are fantastic so not religious technically agnostic as close to atheist as you can get but nobody knows people who pretend to know on both sides atheists and theists there's no way to know spiritual is there something beyond that i don't know you know so in the realm of quantum physics right there's entanglement right so if you can reduce a human existence to the quantum level is that existence entangled with an existence somewhere else in this universe and another universe somewhere else i i don't know i have no idea will i find out once this existence ceases i don't know either that's why i'm trying to squeeze the orange of as much life in this existence in this form as i physically can because i don't know if there's anything on the other side so that yeah that's how i look at how i look at that uh we evolve to perceive a very small portion of reality you know our senses don't perceive everything that exists we can't see in the infrared we can develop devices to see in the infrared but we didn't evolve to see in the infrared so we can't physically detect things that actually exist with just our senses so for me to say this is real or that's real based on my senses is only a small portion of reality so i i can't pretend to know if anything exists beyond this realm of existence if there are higher dimensions or lower dimensions string theory or whatever quantum physics may predict multiverses i don't know how does that tie into spir spirituality i think understanding the nature of reality is a prelude to having some spirituality i think that people who have very little understanding of reality try to ascribe everything to a god or some universal spiritual thing i don't know and if there is some god that created me they'd understand that everything they created isn't going to believe in it right and there is some probability of that you're going to have some probability who are unplugged from the matrix assuming i am unplugged i don't know um so yeah i don't know that that answer the question but that's my perspective you see i went to a a spiritual journey myself like more like an intellectual journey i decided to learn about all the philosophical ideas that there are at least just very little because i just wanted to learn more about reality and all i learned it this has been for for many years every weekend i spent many hours on on all kinds of logics and all kinds of um ethics and philosophies and religions and and i try to learn about all these things i just realized no one has this figured out you know so i i got to take a very similar approach to you um now i say i am a pragmatist you know whatever works man whatever works i i ro with it but being a good person right is a part of that because if whatever rolls is bad stuff right so that's another part of it too where i don't want to cause anyone stress uh but i also don't want to be stressed i try to be as zen you know not that that leans me towards buddhism or anything else but i try to be as you know i just try to be a good person you know right so um well is is good is being a good person a good idea in all context uh i guess you'd have to be selfish if your life was at risk right so and then maybe you're not being a good person but but even then maybe sacrifice one to save a thousand and maybe you're that one that would have to be sacrificed to me you know maybe you have to be selfish in that in that role because maybe your your life is more important than a thousand i don't know it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard gambled away right you know so there there are there are no universal truths all right uh last last last segment um i want to just ask ask you about all the different kind of you know movement sleep vices whatnot uh f firstly firstly just could you describe a day in your life yeah let's see so an ideal day right because uh yes yes of course yeah uh oh there there are two two two versions of that uh for some some reason i've always had the vision of beach house uh surrounded by at least one woman maybe more uh mutual respect love whatever you want to consider it um i do have a 15-year-old so you know uh there have been women in my life where right that been close enough to the point where you know we have what that love would be or mutual respect enough to reproduce but that's been a rare thing you know where uh so the ideal version would would be uh you know to have a compatible partner or partners right um you know but i'm also open to the fact we're maybe that's just not going to be the case and i've just got a conquer raging or die trying and that's what i'm here to do if that is such a perspective right or you know it either is going to happen or not so an ideal would be on the beach uh chilling with loved ones um stressfree while also having this other stuff the other side of this which is obviously i'm going to still spend a significant portion of my time documenting the approach in terms of uh biohacking quote unquote biohacking aging and the science behind it and all of that so you know an ideal day is uh you know wake up eat analyze my data analyze others data read the literature prepare new videos because i'm obsessed with that like i've got so many tabs open for videos that i could make that i just don't have the time because my life right now is pulled in other directions by commitments that i don't have a choice right now but that hopefully will change in the next year or so so um there are a ton more videos that i can make uh get in some exercise and literally i can analyze data and make videos all day i mean and love doing it so you know a combination of the beach getting some sun growing some of my own food if not all hanging out with my loved ones making videos documenting the approach all of that exercise that's all part of the optimal day for me i don't have all of that right now clearly but uh you know i don't want to say on the mental health journey i've been far from where i am now and i'm working towards that so you're not running away from sun no definitely not definitely not working towards the fully enlightened fully you know as happy as i can be approached do you have any vices so i guess junk food is a vice but uh i've learned to minimize it i i wouldn't say conquer it because it's kind of like saying an alcoholic has conquered their alcohol ism so from my early you know so i grew up on junk food my mom would buy boxes of cakes and cookies and and i'd eat 2,000 calories of cake and just go to the park and run around and play basketball for three hours of baseball whatever it was but it caught up to me in my 20s and 30s where um you know i started to gain some weight and be in suboptimal condition and you know i had this binge kind of anorexia or binge purge cycle where i'd eat 10,000 calories and then cut my calorie intake over five or so days so that i'd get relatively lean but that was terrible for my physical emotional and uh cognitive health so i love eating cookies and cakes and all this other stuff it's a it's an addiction i think it's an addiction for most people so i've learned to manage it where you know i've minimized that binge aspect of my personality so alcoholism runs in my family i i don't have that problem problem fortunately but you know this junk food addiction is in my dna um especially in large amounts so after a blood test it seems that if i do have some quote unquote cheat and i know brian doesn't have any cheats although he did mention that he had like some bread recently which is a cheat but uh for me if i go completely cold turkey with any junk that sets me up for one of these binges and i don't want that that's the antithesis of optimal health so immediately after the blood test i'll have some uh quotequote junk you know whe whether it's chocolate mixed with sugar and peanut butter or cheesecake whatever it may be whatever i'm craving on that day but sticking to my calorie goals but not paying attention to the macros and micros so not sticking to the macros and micros which i do for every day is not followed for two to three days i've stuck to two days immediately after the blood test but for whatever reason after this blood test i didn't stick to it for three days after the blood test while still eating a decent diet but i had other stuff that i wanted but calories were on track on track um so i'm basically satiated with the junk and then it's like i don't want anymore and then i i i cut the junk out until the next test so i've managed it i don't think i'll ever conquer it if i think i've conquered it i'll end up binging and that's terrible for me in every way so okay so no hookers and coke um where did the data where did the data leted you in terms of diet right now what's what's your yeah what are you eating so when you consider that that that the majority of women aren't generally attracted to me and i i don't say that happily i wish the opposite were true uh for whatever reason whether it's the physical or what's in my head where's your hair yeah shave it off right but you could see if it grew in i'd have a patch and then some here and then there'd be a patch so i'm not trying to you're not trying to rejuvenate your hair not yet it's not it's not limiting to lifespan right so anyway the hookers at this point would probably make me more sad than happy because it's a superficial treat i guess and then you know it's not a i'm looking for a more long lasting kind of thing but the coke to or any other quote unquote fun stuff i'm not opposed to it you know i do have clients that do some of that stuff and and you know it it's a matter of dose how much of it can you get i don't um as straight edge as you can get but for others that don't want to be as straight edge you know the question is how much it can you get away with the fun stuff where it then starts to negatively impact your health quality of life your biomarkers and if somebody wants to do some of that stuff and none of their biomarkers look bad at very low doses or micro doing whatever it may be you know go for i'm not anti-un i'm pro biomarkers i'm not anti-un what's the balance of both right i mean only one night of doing it like the next day is completely you have like three days your bio rhm completely done not not coke not just coke right just alcohol right or staying up late staying up late throws it off or or overeating too much certain amount of calories throws it off yeah i know what that feels like for the overeating and staying up late and i try to i try my best to feel good every day not okay so we didn't we still didn't find out what you're eating ah yeah so that that i mean i not that that's a secret right i post that everywhere for for those who don't know but the the diet is rich in so i eat i guess i have to start with i eat fish every day sardines are in the approach every day i'm not vegan and that's only because the biomarkers uh suggest that it may be optimal for me so i'm not vegan but the diet is mostly pl plant-based outside of that i do include eggs sometimes i'm open to including beef but there like you said there are only so many calories in the approach and other stuff has stronger correlations in my data than eggs and beef whereas sardines are giving me omega-3s omega-3s decline during aging id of correlations i like them they're more satiating than eggs and beef so if i was going to go higher on meat it would be with uh fish okay outside of that carrots and red bell peppers are staples in the diet carotenoids seem to have a big positive impact on my data so alpha beta carotene beta crypto anthon from the red bell peppers tomatoes and watermelon for lopine which are cottonoids uh about a pound or 450 grams of collared greens has a low oxalate green for ltin and zanthin uh those are all staples based on the data and i've titrated their amounts some of those their amounts higher over time based on the data so collard greens i started off with like 270 grams or so per day and now i'm up to 450 pushing the correlations to see you know is this really a positive effect and to to do that i've cut carrots down from about uh a pound a day down to 270 trying to you know bottom of the u-shape so anyway all right so those are staples beats are a staple um most mostly for the uh nitric oxide potential effects and potential effects on blood pressure but also a very strong net positive correlative score and it's also crazy to say but nitric oxide is a big part of the the beat story and it's like nature's viagra you know i hate you know i see brian trying to do p penis rejuvenation and tracking his uh nocturnal nocturnal hardons and i don't want to say i don't have a problem with most important research right right but i don't have a problem there i don't know what's optimal but i don't have a problem there and i don't know if it's because of 330 grams of beets per day but uh so beets are beats are a part of the everyday approach parsley in the everyday approach uh to potentially inhibit cd38 as a part of the nad story uh strawberries frozen strawberries which i make in a smoothie with the beets and parsley and some flavoring agent like ginger cinnamon or uh vanilla beans so i eat a lot of strawberries uh probably about five 00 gram per day frozen strawberries staple in the approach nuts and seeds a mix of almonds peanuts walnuts flax seeds uh which cover a variety of bases um some of which omega-3 monounsaturated fats fiber nias and etc dates are in there mostly to sweeten up the flax seeds uh brazil nuts for the selenium see if i'm missing it out i eat a cooked mi cooked mix with the collar greens tomatoes chickpeas which may have a positive impact on kidney function in my data uh turmeric black pepper which seem to be an allstar for multiple bi biomarkers i do add some salt to that but a very small amount mustard powder for uh the sulfurane and broccoli which is also a part of the purge so uh cardamom and and and cloves so there's a lot i list it all in diet composition videos without the sake of boring you too much more about my diet these are these are daily these are your staple uhhuh staples yep okay um what about about your pe how many pe do you take a day yeah so right now consistently nothing um oh nothing nothing right now uh in the for about nine months of the of the year a supplement of vitamin d a thousand iuse per day uh i have not got that answer yet from a rejuvenation olympic atlete to take not a single pill right now interesting interesting but that that's not all year round like that right so like you know so next week when once rapid meon comes i'm going to be on rapid m for probably two weeks maybe a bit bit less well actually it's got to be it takes about a week to get the candida results so that's at least a two week supplemental period but the vitamin d is there i don't take it in the summer unlike brian i try to get sun exposure without sunscreen um it's hard in boston though because the cloudy days and weather's not always great but i did the experiment i've only had sun exposure for like four days so far and two two months and my vitamin d was 38 which i want to be above 30 how much above 30 is optimal for 25 hydroxy d who knows but that's with no supplementation in only four days of sun and i'm not deficient and usually i get a lot more sun in the summer so that illustrates that i don't need vitamin d in the summer i do have nn which i play around with i do have nicotinic acid which i play around with but even there i'm still trying to optimize nad through diet uh with not much success yet but that's it that's it for supplements i do use supp al vanilla in the in the mouthwash to try to kill off a bad microbe in my oral microbiome so that's technically a supplement i do have vitamin b6 which i've experimented with but i haven't used that in a while but yeah nothing other than occasional vitamin d right now if i don't get sun for a week and rap a yeah nothing nothing for off and on nmn and penic acid but nothing consistent where did you get those guns what the the the oh do you move yeah uh i'm not a big guy i just lean you know so i mean you look like this maybe not that big but the workouts are uh 90 minutes compound movements you know i'm not doing bicep curls and tricep push downs i'm doing overhead presses and cleaning jerks and pull-ups you know yeah trying to stay as fit and strong as possible not lose an ounce of strength during aging 0 minutes is a lot yeah i used to go longer used to be a three-hour workout but the heart rate variability and wrestling heart rate was terrible overtrained i felt tired all the time uh so i could go longer it you know part of it is a mental thing too where you know if you're running you know running becomes a mental thing after a while where you know you run a certain amount of time and you know if you're doing sprints it's not a mental thing it's very simple and quick right but if you're running for 10 and 20 minutes it's a ch it's a mental challenge right so part of it is the challenge you know i want to i don't want to just do an in-n-out workout and be done i really want to you know it's my brain right it's it's all right mfer let's go like uh your your your your data your data suggests you're recovered let's go don't you know don't out you know uh you're not going for 45 minutes you're you're going for every rep on every set um for all 90 minutes and i don't want it to be 95 i don't want it to be 99 like i do a set workout so that i can track it over time so if i go longer i'm being an old man you know because which uh it sounds like a slur but you know the old phenotype is old mice have to take more breaks when they run right they need more rest and recovery so if i can do the same workout the same sets and reps same weight for every movement that i'm doing for a standardize workout as i'm 20 as when i'm 90 100 plus in the same amount of time how much have i aged how aged is my physiology at that point so that's a challenge right some of that is a challenge and it's it's almost like i'm literally fighting against aging aging in that moment for example my pull-ups have been 12 to 13 and these are you know strict above the bar none of this i'm barely getting there you know for i don't know five six years but i was also 15 to 20 pounds heavier during that time probably had a bit more muscle mass so as i've gotten leaner it's gotten harder to get to the 12 forget 13 now there is going to be some small amount of muscle function loss with the 20 pb weight loss right it's almost impossible to not lose some amount of lean mass and lose 20 pounds of weight which i'm okay with but lately it's or not lately but in the past couple months it's been 10 reps of pull-ups 10 now i'm down two reps is that is that because of the the weight loss and lean mass loss is this a motivation thing is this an aging thing so now my mind is like all right mfer let's go are you just being lazy like are you bored with pull-ups like so i'm back to 11 but i've got to get back to 12 before it's two years have passed and now i'm back to 10 and now i've aged right for whatever reason so um so yeah it's a 90 minute thing but a lot a lot of this is a mental thing you know and i try to push myself me mentally not just physically you see you couldn't be more different in this from me um i'm i'm i'm doing the exact opposite so i'm i'm of course doing the this three times a week um some resistance training but maybe it's 30 minutes 40 minutes at maximum but uh i'm doing it even that in a way that i have like um periods maybe maybe half a year periods every half a year i decide okay so this half a year i'm doing cattle bell this half a year i'm doing body weight this half a year i'm doing bodybuilding so i'm periodizing and always changing up and this way i can keep my motivation up but i'm also doing the you know well i call it cardio but often it's just playing with my kids so um but but but but what i'm i'm most proud of because this is a unique unique solution and and i i think you couldn't incorporate this into your routine that every day i have i do three workouts in the morning in the middle of the day and at night these are just 10 minute workout 5 to 15 and in the morning um i put on some some video and this can be absolutely anything for one week i'm doing a single video right it can be right now i'm doing te right next week i'm going to do karat and then kickboxing so now i'm i'm going through martial arts but it can be taii or or or or whatnot whatever you can find like i see dave pasco is doing p90x and i want to know what p90x so i put it on that i am going to try that thing out for a week so in the middle of the day as i told you my lungs are not great so i'm doing breath work which is i don't know if it it it does things right i can hold my bread for a long time now i'm doing the v of stuff but uh i i have no idea if it actually does like like does it have my breath but i have to throw to to everything at it except the the kitchen sink right so and that night it's more like mobilizational stretching or or whatnot i'm not quite sure what should i do at night i definitely shouldn't work out but i don't i don't believe in stretching so anyway but i stra but what you're doing is that you're you have a very strict regime and you're not playing around right but that's it's evolved over time into that so i i've been in that approach too where i've tried everything and changed it up that doesn't work for me like so if i'm doing you know instead of doing pull-ups i'll do pull downs or you know more rows or something let's just say for my for my lats and my back and and biceps right if i'm not so if i'm changing it up and then i go back to pull-ups at some period of time because i haven't trained that movement it ends up being weaker so sure i got general muscle stimulus and maybe it's more fun because i've got more variety but now i've got to work back to get to where i was for the number of reps on pull-ups right so for me it works better for me to to have a standardized workout i i don't i don't generally suffer from motivation unless i'm in some amount of sleep debt and my heart rate variability resting heart rate are below average nothing impacts my motivation worse than even a mild sleep deb so i generally don't have problems with uh now i have to do this movement during the workout or like i enjoy i i enjoy all of the you know and i have even like a a whole routine is is basically mapped for those 90 minutes it isn't i feel like doing this at this time i'll do this it's it's a certain order i do it in order um because for example i don't want to you know i don't want to do pull-ups and then do a row right so i'm doing super the whole thing is a cardio workout for 90 minutes it's basically circuit training so so you know there's an order to that whole process where i can do it the most efficiently not just in terms of time but in terms of maximizing gain both cardiovascularly and functionally right so and everything in there too is is with the goal of like you mentioned stretching stretching is a big part of it mobility is a big part of it balance is a big part of it where i'm actively training those things during the workout now if i was doing other stuff to change it up i wouldn't be tracking those things because i wouldn't be actively doing them i'd be doing other stuff whereas workout to workout week to week i can see how i'm progressing or not and then do more do less to try to improve a given a given movement so oh here is an idea try out animal flow you heard about it anima animal flow animal flow yeah animal flow yeah move around like an enima if if you ever need a change then you can try that because you can do that in a more structured way as well but you can also get a feel of of play you know so that's a more like uh capera yeah yeah yeah it's from coer and a bunch of other things um anyway what about your sleep all right wait so i had some more about the uh exercise so so you know there's this idea that's pervading that you know as high a v2 max and as as work out as much as you can to be as physically strong as you can but i'm in a slightly different boat where i'm not aiming for my peak capacity in terms of function it's i'm happy to be above average for my genetics but i also don't want to overtrain which the markers of stress being heart rate variability and i don't think the majority of people in this field that influencer space is looking at it like that for example not to name drop but i know peter ata is the get your v2 max as high as possible but but the the energy cost and work involved to get there is an amount of stress that may not optimize heart rate variability and resting heart rate and in that case when considering that exercise is well known to increase average lifespan but not maximal where are the 120 year old marathon runners or fitness enthusiasts in animal models wheel running uh in rats gets them an average lifespan increase but does not get them to the maximum so there's something great about exercise but also bad for maximum lipan i want the max and beyond so for me it's what's the dose of exercise that gets me as close or beyond to the maximal while not being overtrained using the metrics as a guide for that so i'm happy to not have my peak strength or peak v2 max but to have above above average levels and resist age related decline for me those are more important metrics than a v2 max of 65 like elite endurance athlete but have heart rate variability of age expected and and wrestling heart rate right so um all right so that's the exercise story i wanted to make sure i got that out there sleep is still a work in progress immensely better than it's been um a sleep with earplugs because i'm on a busy boston street hopefully sooner than later that's not the case i'll be closer to the rural rural and out of the city out of city life have a blackout shade but i do have some light pollution because i'm on the street and it's got lights there room temperature and humidity seems to have a big impact on my sleep quality which is not great because although my ac works better when it's not 90 degrees fahrenheit it struggles in the extreme heat in boston at least so that impacts sleep quality so that's something i'll have to improve once i live somewhere else not in this city but sleep consistency going to the same time going to bed at the same time every night is almost a constant it's rare when i'm asleep later than usual i mean sometimes i'll have some academic stress which i can't stand which will get in the way of sleep quality where my on my sleep onset will be an hour and a half later just because i'm thinking about that i don't like thinking about which is one reason to get out of academia but generally that's not the case i try to minimize that but going to sleep at the same time every night trying to sleep as much as i physically can which doesn't always work sometimes i'm e 30 minutes of sleep debt where if i can i'll take a nap on that day to catch up but yeah sleep optimization the eating window is early generally ending it before the majority of it before 1:00 p.m. Sometimes even uh 11: to 12 a.m. To give as much time to pee out all the water rich fruits and vegetables that i'm eating but that's probably where the weakness is in my data where i still wake up sometimes use the bathroom at night two times during the night and psa is three it's not i don't have prostate problems or at least i don't think i have prostate problems based on psa levels uh so i don't think it's that it's probably a chronically hydrated problem but ending the eating window as early as possible helps minimize that because i used to have uh omad i used to eat omad and eat from like 6 to nine at night fast all day and i was up at 10 11 12 1 the sleep was terrible so uh i've minimize that dramatically s sleep quality is incred im immeasurably better uh and nothing affects my mental health more than uh you know a great night of sleep and i like having good mental health not feeling depressed so yeah it it's seems like you can you can improve upon stuff on on sleep so might might come even farther along than 15th place on the rejuvenation olympics you get i'm not sure how much sleep makes it better because that's been pretty much a constant but if my sleep quality was worse and duration i'd imagine it' be worse i don't know that i can further improve the need and pace based on sleep there are other stuff other secret sauce maybe i'll put that put that conquer or die trying the secret sauce secret juice what's the secret juice is there a is there a is there something extra that you're doing that other people don't do and that's the secret source the secret juice is the data it's tracking the data following the data you know and aside from the people that i'm working with as clients who are doing that themselves too or i'm tracking their data and helping them make evidencebased uh suggestions and people that are watching the youtube videos that may be trying it on their own i don't think very many many people have that secret sauce right and maybe it's not the secret sauce immediately maybe it takes three years of discovering the secret juice recipe right but um things that are resistant to change biomarkers that are res resistant to change i found that they are not resistant to change using this approach so i've got the secret juice for now we'll see if we'll see how long i can live using this the secret sauce but uh yeah so far so good what about the environment h house like uh physical spaces i mean uh light i'd say right now it's not optimal uh could be better so right now i'm in a one benin boston but the benefit there is that i'm very close to work so uh it's a very short commute so if the commute was longer everything would be worse physical mental health uh road rage all the things that suck about commuting yeah at some point that i'm working working on uh getting my own house you know over the next and like i said moving to the rural area or more rural area uh less air air pollution less noise pollution that's definitely on the to-do list so you're doing it next to work while you're raising a child alone and and building your your own application is is that so yeah i i don't have a life you that's my whole life right there there you know and the youtube channel that's well yeah and the youtube channel yeah so that's literally everything from from the time that i'm not working on academic stuff it's time with you know the the 15y old it's the youtube every second of the day not just every calorie every second of the day is pretty much counter for sometimes i do screw around right because you can one can't focus on academic pursuits all day every day i'm not that guy and i'll look at just dumb stuff and then i'm like what am i doing you know five minutes later i'm like what am i doing and that gets me back into what i was doing right so uh there's a balance between focusing on nonsense and focusing on the really serious stuff so i do have a little bit of nonsense you know that i'll pay attention to any other athletes on the reation leaderboard that you know uh dave and i have corresponded a few times brian and i have uh corresponded by email a few times one time on zoom anybody else that i know jville we had a we texted a few times talked once or twice john or josh best a little bit of communication i think you interviewed him uh yet ah not yet but a little bit on twitter trying to think of anybody else i've tagged steve ioki telling him he needs to catch up i've tagged peter d amandes telling him he he needs to catch up too no no response no couldn't reach them either yeah there's some people that just post and don't don't reply which is kind of like the tv and i hate tv i haven't had a tv for 15 years or so so if there are people on x or social media where they'll post and they don't respond to anybody unless it's with some kind of check mark or a certain amount of followers i it's it's a huge turnoff i have in my to-do list to reply to people half a year ago right like they sent me a private message like i i i do i prioritize everything that i do i i use the tro word because i had a company and i had to prioritize other people's time so i i i decided to use the exact same process for myself and and now i there are people i cannot literally reply it's it's it's not in my my my priorities yeah i totally objectively so i try to respond to everyone but i get what you're saying because they it gets to a point where so think about it every youtube video i make if a 100 or 200 people respond but now i'm on linkedin i'm on reddit i'm posting in five different subreddits like i said i do that on purpose because i want the feedback good bad or ugly right so i try to resp respond to everything so there's only so much time in the day and it becomes a triage where you can't respond to everyone but if someone's making a physical post somewhere people have responded and it's you know you kind of lose you know there may be pe like for example i look at someone like brian and brian is the closest thing i could think of brian actually dave too and dave and i communicate pretty regularly on instagram or have communicated pretty regularly but i i look at people in this space who are doing things similar to to me and i think we should all be best buds like you know so if brian posts something on x and i'm one of the people who comment and he doesn't see it he's not reading his own comments he's i think he's potentially losing out and vice versa right so you know if i'm posting something and people are commenting and i'm not looking i'm potentially losing out on relationships or interactions that could benefit me and vice versa so not everybody sees it like that but just going back to the tv it's like the tv only talks talks it doesn't care if you talk back to it and again i i f and hate the tv and i don't want to be like that so but i get the balance right you can only respond to so many people my my generation doesn't watch tv so what's your not sure what you're talking about what's your chronological age 30 oh okay so i don't want to say i'm a great thinker people can decide that or not for themselves they can think i'm rubbish or or the other side of that but sometimes people at the far right side of the normal distribution aren't appreciated in their time and i can think of people there are a handful handful of people i can think of that have been in science for now that have great ideas that aren't going to be appreciated for probably two or three generations afterwards so am i in that boat i don't know but it's interesting because like people of your generation and in that ballpark in that age range maybe i'm maybe i'm a generation or two ahead of my time right where you know you fast forward 75 years 50 years 25 years when will we have this technology in our homes right where calculating the correlations is something you wake up and based on your biometrics whether it's peeing in the toilet pooping in the toilet or some fingerprick blood test whatever it may be you've got your data for the day i don't know if you've seen the movie but gataka have you ever seen the movie gataka so it's a basically a genetic version of the future it's one of my all-time favorite movies if you put the if you like the matrix it's in there too the the gatic is in there too different kind of movie but anyway there's a scene in the movie where one of the characters he looks at a watch or wearable and someone else ask him how long do you need and he says i need 20 minutes right so that's based on some prediction right so that's the future i see so if my approach is quantified into some technology which i anticipate it's going to be at some point 5 10 15 whatever it may be it's going to be like an everyday thing for some gen younger generation right and maybe the younger generations look at me as the as the og right so anyway anyway i don't want to say there is no reason why your toilet shouldn't be analyzing the out of that's a great that's a t-shirt you got to put that on a t-shirt that's fantastic there's no reason your toilet shouldn't be analyzing the out of you literally but anyway so if if this stuff is a generation or two ahead of its time you know we'll see okay so no leadup just the question what is what is one thing that many people disagree with you but you strongly believe to be the case yeah that's interesting are there things that you think might be true like that in my case i can't think of anything off the top of my head if you tell me to sleep well well yeah thanks like no sherlock you're not saying anything everyone knows that you should sleep well but if you tell me something that a lot of people disagrees with but you actually think that hey this is the thing that i i strongly believe like you might actually give me some f for provide me some value yeah yeah i get the premise the only reason i'm having trouble with it because is because uh if i believe something so strongly that i'm married to that idea for me it it i lack an open-mindedness in that scenario and i hope that i'm not married to any of my ideas so strongly where i'm not open to someone else's perspective so i tend to think that i'm not married to an idea or an approach so strongly that i don't consider that something else could be true so i think the first thing that pops into my mind is there is no one siiz all one size fits-all for diet so um and this may be controversial but the idea that someone could be on a carnivore or an animal-based diet and it's a suboptimal approach relative to other diets maybe that's controversial and the reason i say that is is and i'm not on a carnivore diet i'm far from it almost exclusively plant-based but i think that based on someone's biomarkers if you show me the net of your biomarkers are improved on a given diet carnivore vegan whatever it may be i i'm open to it right but just the idea that your diet is x it can't be good because mediterranean diet seems to be the best which by the way the mediterranean diet is only a shade better than the western diet it's like it's not much better i mean it's pizza and pasta i don't know pizza but it's a little bit better but there are higher levels even to the what's consider a mediterranean diet you know um for i'll give you a quick example so yeah i know what the research considers to be a mediterranean diet is very different from yeah 100% so so but that's the first thing that i i could think of but i don't know if there if there's something that you think maybe that i would be very strongly i mean the core my core philosophy is you got to test like you know pe some people will come at me with so much certitude sometimes uh in the comments youtube comments or elsewhere where you know i'll show the data i'll show the mechanistic hypothesis and they'll say you got to do x y or z with so much certitude and uh so you could say they think something and i think differently but it's like most people have an idea based on what they expect to be to be true based on limited evidence or belief you know so i try not to be like that you know it's uh try to be open-minded i i don't know that that answers your question but i try to be open-minded enough to where it isn't so binary you know what i mean where i try to be able to understand everybody's perspectives even even you know if you say what's your political how do you lean politically right there are some things that i agree with uh conservative republicans about and other things i i agree with uh very liberal democrats progressive democrats right for the most part i'm a libertarian stay the out of my way let me do my thing don't don't let don't have the government tell me what to do uh um but i see the value in some of the positions on all sides right so i try not to be so dogmatic in my approach where you know i can't see something from a given perspective right so libertarians let's let's talk about well not libertarianism but very close to it is is austrian economics and what austrian economics economists like to do is go to deserted islands so let's go to deserted island and there is a little economy in the deserted island and then you have to provide some value to other people to exchange uh for for money right now let's say this deserted island is this word this reality what can other people trade with you yeah so i can only go so far on what i do right so i do have things that i'm not great at yet uh ideally so so for right now i have to go food shopping i can't grow my own food right so i have to be able to offer enough value to the world that i have money to pay for food right so technically that's the value that someone could offer so even if i've got enough land to grow the majority of my own food it doesn't cover all the bases right i'm not fish i don't know the time the fish the value i offer i hope that would be enough where i could trade for fish fatty fish sardines salmon whatever it may be so for now i guess the value would be food that i can't grow on my own uh but you know being as self-sufficient as possible you know when you hear unpluged from the matrix i think being as self-sufficient as possible is one aspect of that it's not just the system wants you to believe x y or z it's uh do you have to go to the store to get your food you know you know could you survive i mean granted i would need something like starlink you know to to have internet and connect connect to society right so there's a few people that are building these tools that i would need to rely upon but i wouldn't need the government for internet or other internet companies you know trying to rely as much on on myself as possible as a part of this thing but i would need some things like certain foods you know and hope that what i can offer i could get back right you see i tried to go way too obstruct with this question but uh what i wanted to ask you is that this this is the time the show for call to action for a for for an advertisement so do you have a product right now that um you're you're selling that you're value that you're providing to other people that it's such a big value that they are even willing to give you money for it sure yeah so the obvious is i have t-shirts in any color or red blue i don't know uh red white and blue uh not for any reason that's just the colors uh yeah there are plenty of ways to support me and what i'm doing um besides t-shirts watching youtube watching youtube videos i have patreon where i have various tiers people can check out i post my daily data for uh fitness metrics i post my daily diet post uh early videos these are all separate tiers i post correlations with the data it's another tier i offer one-onone consults so there are many ways that people can support me and i can offer value back so that's probably the best way is patreon and and uh t-shirts there are also affiliate links that are on those sites too so people are blood testing whether it's true diagnostic or nad or any blood test in general if they use discount links that are under the youtube videos that help support what i do and then there's ways to donate you know i've got things like buy me a coffee i've got uh i also wrote a book in 2016 that people could check out but that's on a slightly different topic microbial burden and what we can do to fight back so yeah those are the ways to support michael lgarden conquer aging or die trying fellow freedom lover thank you very much yes thanks adam
