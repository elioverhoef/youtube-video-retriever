# HbA1c: What's Optimal, What's My Data?

## Transcript

A major focus of the channel is to simultaneously optimize as many health related biomarkers as possible so with that in mind in today's video what's optimal for hba1c otherwise known as glycated hemoglobin so to address that we'll take a look at two studies in the first which included more than 6,000 people we've got blood hemoglobin a1c levels in percentage on the y- axis plotted against age on the x within the 20 to 90e age range in youth around 20 years old we can see that average hba1c values are around 5% whereas in 90y olds they're significantly higher at about 6% in the second study which included about 378,000 people and is quick aside i always try to look for the largest epidemiological studies to look for age related changes and all cause mortality risk so if anyone's come across larger studies with a larger sample size please leave it in the comments and i'd be happy to give you a shout out and use the the data obviously in a future video so in this study of about 378,000 people average hba1c values in youth around 20 years for both women and men was about 5.3% which then increased during aging with a peak in in the 70 to 80 year range for both women and men but then something interesting happens which is it declines hba1c actually declines which is new to me this is i haven't yet seen this in the published literature so i think this is possibly a survivor bias where people who live to older than 70 or 80 are more likely to have relatively lower hba1c values so if anyone's come across that story or has more insight please leave it in the comments and let's share with the community so from these two studies we can see that hba1c increases during aging and in terms of the what's optimal question we know that 5 to 5.3% is found in youth but what about all cause mortality risk how is hba1c related to all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here so in this study which which is a meta analysis of 46 studies we've got the pulled hazard ratio so risk of death for all causes on the y- axis plotted against the circulating hba1c level on the x and when 5 to 6% for hba1c was defined as the reference we can see that people who had hba1c lower than 5% had a significally increased risk all cause mortality risk and we know that because the 95% confidence interval which is the red line with the data above and below the circle are completely above a hazard ratio of one and we can see this illustrated al with the hazard ratio there 90% increase risk and we can see that that confidence interval is completely above one at 1.04 to 1.36 so having hba1c lower than 5% was associated with an increased all cause mortality risk similarly people who had hba1c in the 6 to 6.5% range also had a significantly increased risk 16% increased risk to be exact but then the greatest risk was for people who had hba1c greater than 6.5% with a 71% increased all cause mortality risk so to address what's optimal when you including both the aging and all cause mortality risk data somewhere in the 5 to 5.3% uh range may be optimal so that's what's found in youth and when considering that hba1c increases during aging when uh considering that lowest risk for all cause mortality was in the 5 to 6% range we want to be closer to five but not below five as that was associated with an increaseed all cause mortality risk so again 5 to 5.3 3% i think that's a fair range for what's optimal which brings us to what's my data am i practicing what i'm preaching or is my data terrible so this is for the october 9th blood test and on that day hba1c was 5.1% now if you look at the plots from that i just showed the two studies on age related changes my expected hba1c based on chronological age is 5.8% and we're considering that a major focus of the channel is to simultaneously as many health related at ated biomarkers as possible so far so good with hba1c as it's younger than expected based on chronological age all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buck aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics ned quantification epigenetic and tm testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing with sidey fox health which includes apob green tea diet tracking or if you'd like to support the panel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch which i've got on here so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
