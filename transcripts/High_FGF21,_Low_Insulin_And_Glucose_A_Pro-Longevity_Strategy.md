Fibroblast growth factor 21 also known as fgf21 impacts the health and or function of many organs and tissues but what about longevity so fgf21 overexpression so animals that are engineered to have more systemic levels of fgf21 have a longer lifespan so first before looking at that uh how how much higher was fgf21 in these transgenic mice so whether comparing the fed or fasted state we can see that the animals that were engineered to have more systemic levels of fgf21 had five to tenfold higher levels when compared with animals normal animals wild type wt all right so lifespan data so here we're looking at uh lifespan data in c57 black 6j mice and that's the genetic background and that's important because i'm going to compare the lifespan extending effect of fgf21 versus other interventions in mice and those interventions and mice are going to be in these c57 black six j mice so they're all performed on the same genetic background and only the intervention is different all right so first starting with the data on the left we're looking at survival so uh the black line is average survival the the proportion where half the animals are dead and half are still alive and we can see that fgf21 overexpression in the male mice significantly extended average lifespan but not maximal lifespan as we can see both the controls the wild type and the fgf21 transgenic mites live to about 42 months so in in terms of the average lifespan extending effect the controls live 28 months whereas the fgf21 over expressing mice live 36 months a significant increase in lifespan what about the data in females so again starting with the average survival right at the 50 survival mark we can see that the fgf21 over expression in the female mice extended both average and also maximal lifespan and interestingly they stopped the experiment when the animals got to 43 months so it's unknown how much beyond 43 months that these uh female over expressing fgf21 mice would have lived so in terms of the average lifespan increase the controls live 30 months on average and the fgf21 over expressing mice tg live 40 months so a 10 month extension about a 30 increase in average lifespan so these are pretty big uh pretty large effects how does the fgf21 mediated lifespan extension compare against other interventions so i'm going to show two that have been uh popularized that because they're they've been they were recently published alpha ketoglutarate and berberine so first starting with alpha ketoglutarate supplementation this is based on data that was published last year and also notice uh this data again as i mentioned is in c57 black 6j mice so same genetic background different intervention whether it's fgf21 over expression or alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation so starting with the data on the left this is pulled data from two studies and we can see based on the p-value that alpha-ketoglutarate uh supplementation significantly extended both average and maximal lifespan but note that all all of the mice were dead at 37 months uh so how does that compare against the fgf21 uh transgenic mice so whereas the alpha ketoglutarate supplemented mice lived 31 months fgf21 overexpressing mice live 40 months uh again that's like a 30 increase when compared with alpha ketoglutarate and then uh in terms of maximum lifespan we can see that the uh the fgf21 over expressing my say and again this is the data in females lived at least 43 months where the alpha ketoglutarate supplemented a female mice lived 38 months so uh once again fgf21 overexpression seems to be a better intervention for extending lifespan than alpha-ketoglutarate now in the males we can see that the p-value for uh lifespan extension was not significantly different versus the wild type versus the non-supplemented controls so uh nonetheless let's have a quick look at the comparison for the alpha-ketoglutarate alpha-ketoglutarate supplemented male mice versus uh fgf21 overexpressing male mice and we can see that the alpha-ketoglutarate supplemented male mice lived an average of 31 months whereas the fgf21 transgenic mice live 36 months so uh from this we can conclude that fgf 21 over expression increases lifespan more than alpha-ketoglutarate uh alpha-ketoglutarate supplemented mice so how does the lifespan extension in fgf21 might compare against berberine uh and the reason i i've highlighted these two studies is because they were just recently published uh i'm you know i don't i don't have time to go through all of the lifespan uh extension the studies that have looked at lifespan extension but i just wanted to cover a few so once again notice that these data for berberine supplementation is in c57 black 6j mice so again same genetic background the only thing that's different for comparing fgf21 transgenic mice with the alpha-ketoglutarate and the berberine supplementation is the intervention but the genetic background is the same so uh based on this data we can see that the average uh lifespan in berberine supplementa mice was increased when compared with non-burmarine supplemented mice and also maximal lifespan was increased by a small amount but notice that the uh duration that the mice lived in both the berberine and the wild type study is is that none of these mice live past 26 months so uh in contrast fgf21 transgenic mice live much longer than berberine supplemented mice so just to have a look at that the numbers and notice that uh in this study they didn't report data for females that only reported data for male mice that were supplemented with berberine so we can see that berberine supplemented mice lived on average 23 months whereas the fgf21 mice live 36 months and all of the fgf21 transgenic mice uh they had a a maximal lifespan of 42 months whereas none of the male mice in this study whether controls or berberine supplemented lived past 25 26 months so from this data we can we can uh see that fgf21 uh uh transgenic mice seems to be a better strategy when compared to uh to extend lifespan when compared to alpha-ketoglutarate or berberine supplementation so with this in mind uh and with this strong lifespan extending effect of fgf21 over expression the the next question is how does fgf21 compare against the gold standard for lifespan extension in mice cr calorie restriction and uh let's have a look at that data so here we have uh survival data and again this is in the same genetic background c57 black 6j mice and uh uh we've got data for ad-lib so the animals a as much as they wanted 20 cr so uh that's the blue line and then 40 cr so 40 cr didn't extend lifespan in this study so i'm not going to talk about it i'm just going to talk about the data comparing the ad lib mice versus the 20 cr mice and looking at average survival we can clearly see that both average survival and maximum lifespan are both extended by uh 20 calorie restriction and that's what the numbers look like there so the controls lived an average of 25 and 33 months for average maximal lifespan whereas 20 cr that was 36 and 45 months so how does this data in the female mice for uh 20 cr compare against fgf21 transgenic mice uh so uh whereas the female twenty percent cat restricted mice lived an average of 36 months fgf21 transgenic mice lived 40 months and then in terms of maximal lifespan whereas the 20 cr mice live 45 months uh it's hard to make that comparison here because the fgf21 over expressing female mice that experiment was stopped at 43 months so they lived at lit at least 43 months so they're somewhere in the ballpark of the calorie restriction uh uh 45 months for maximum lifespan so male mice that were exposed to 20 cr that's what we can see here and they have an average increased average and maximal lifespan as indicated by the vertical lines and the arrows so uh in terms of the numbers the controls uh not on cr live 26 and 36 months for average and maximal lifespan but mice male mice that were on 20 cr 33 and 42 months obviously significant increases for both average maximum lifespan so to compare that against the males that were fgf21 overexpressing we can see that their average lifespan was 36 months which is higher than the 20 cr where they only live 33 months and then the fgf 21 overexpressing male mice also had similar maximum lifespan to the uh 20 cr mice which was 42 months so based on this data it looks like there's a higher average lifespan for fgf overexpressing tg transgenic female and male mice when compared with cr so it's a pretty good intervention it seems for extending lifespan so with this in mind how can fgf21 expression be increased in people and there are a variety of studies that have investigated this including starvation and fasting so these are all interventions that increase fgf21 levels in people eating a low methionine containing diet so methionine restriction and eating a low protein diet have also been shown to increase fgf21 levels a high-fat ketogenic diet increases it and also exercise now while these uh picking one of these interventions is relatively easy however the story gets more complicated because there are situations such as obesity and aging that also increases so first in terms of the obesity story here we can see uh circulating fgf levels on the x-axis plotted against bmi on the y-axis and this is data in healthy controls hc and in type 2 diabetics t2d and we can clearly see that there's a as as bmi increases there's a positive correlation and fgf1 levels correspondingly increase so higher bmi is correlated with a higher systemic level of fgf21 and as i mentioned aging also increases fgf21 so that's what we can see here so uh the log of fgf circulating fgf 21 levels on the y axis and then plotted against people who were young younger than 40 years old and old relatively older uh old uh older than seven years old and we can see that the older adults had about a twofold higher systemic level circulating level of fgf21 so then that raises the question you know how can we tell if having higher levels of fgf21 during aging is good or bad for health so before we get to that uh this was a relatively small study in terms of the aging effect let's have a look at a little bit a bigger study that included a wider age range and that's what we can see here so in this study they looked at fgf levels starting with children as young as 5 years old and all the way up to people who are 80 years old and what we can see is a clear increase in circulating fgf21 levels from 156 to uh about double 358.5 so again how can we tell if having higher levels of ftf 21 during aging is good or bad for longevity so to to get at that uh question we can uh derive some insight from centenary and offspring so the kids of people who live uh uh the kids are people who live longer than a hundred years old so first uh and offspring have a generally better health than age match people that are not kids of centenarians and one way to uh in support of that hypothesis we can look at all-cause mortality risk so when looking at the all-cause mortality risk uh for centenarians offspring versus controls which is what what's plotted here when looking at the odds ratio for all-cause mortality or even death deaths related to cancer or cardiovascular disease we can see significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality cancer and cardiovascular disease in centenarians offspring when compared with controls so just looking at the odds ratio we can see a 62 percent uh decreases for 62 percent 71 and 85 percent for total mortality cancer and cardiovascular disease related mortality in centenarians offspring versus controls so what about fgf21 in centenary and offspring so that's what's shown here fgf21 plotted on the y-axis as found in different groups so off is a centenary in offspring hc healthy controls uh t2dnc is type 2 diabetic patients without complications t2dc are type 2 diabetic patients with complications so they had complications that are commonly associated with type 2 diabetes like kidney disease eye disease nerve problems etc and then ad alzheimer's disease patients and what we can see is that the offspring of cetenarians had significantly higher levels of circulating levels of fgf21 versus all of these groups so that would suggest that it's a pro-longevity hormone as the animal data so how can we gain more insight into whether having higher levels of fgf21 during aging would be good or bad for health so uh also in the centenary and offspring when comparing the secondary and offspring versus their partners who were who did not have parents that were centenarians we can see that the centenary and offspring also have significantly lower levels of fasting glucose and fasting insulin now this is important because fgf21 transgenic mice so the mice that were engineered to have more circulating uh and systemic levels of of fgf21 this pattern is also found in the old fgf21 over expressing mice both in the male and the female mice so when looking at that data starting at the male mice we can see that the insulin levels in the old fgf21 over expressing transgenic mice are about half of what the uh non-fgf-21 over over expressing mice have and then there's a significant reduction in glucose too in these fg fgf 21 overexpressing mice so what about in the female animals so uh insulin levels were close to statistical significance you can see that p-value was 0.08 and the insulin levels were about half in the fgf transgenic female mice when compared with the wild-type mice but the glucose levels in the fgf21 over over expressing mice were significantly lower when compared with the uh normal levels of fgf21 so when considering all these data it would seem that having high fgf21 levels when combined with relatively lower glucose and insulin may be a pro-longevity strategy all right that's all i've got for now i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
