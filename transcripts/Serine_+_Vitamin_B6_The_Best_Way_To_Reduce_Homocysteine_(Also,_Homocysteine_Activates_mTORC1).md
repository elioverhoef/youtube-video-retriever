## Transcript

Rapamycin extends lifespan and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got survival plotted against age in days and in this study rapamycin was started at midlife approximately 600 days and then when looking at median lifespan that's the time when half the colony has died and half is still alive we can see that significant extension for media and lifespan and this is in male mice this effect is also true in female mice i covered that in an earlier video and if you missed it it'll be in the right corner one mechanism for how rapamycin impacts lifespan involves inhibition of mtor complex one or mtorq1 and we can see that here on this relatively short list of m torque 1 inhibitors rapamycin is there now inhibiting m torque 1 during aging is potentially important because when m torque 1 is hyperactive we can see that it negatively impacts the health or function of many organ systems including hypertension or high blood pressure obesity dyslipidemia high blood lipids non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and afld neurodegeneration cancer and so on so with that in mind that raises the question are there blood biomarkers of m torque one activity so when mtorq1 is active there is an increased phosphorylation of p70x s6k as shown here with that little phosphorylation group there or po4 so now we can get more specific with our question of blood biomarkers of m torque 1 activity are any blood biomarkers related to phosphorylated levels of p70 s6k and there is homocysteine homocysteine activates m torque one and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got relative protein levels of phosphorylated levels of p70 s6k plotted against the homocysteine concentration on the x-axis and as the levels of homocysteine increase we can see relatively higher levels of phosphorylated p70 s6k in other words homocysteine activates mtorq1 now that's important because homocysteine increases during aging and that's we can see here so on the y-axis we've got plasma levels of total homelessness steam plotted against age from 12 to older than 80 years old and for both males and females we see that age-related increase for homocysteine now similarly my homocysteine levels have increased during aging too and this is data going back to 2005 through 2023 i have 31 blood tests for homocysteine over that time span and note that for some of the data on the right i've supplemented with folate b6 b12 trimethylglycine also known as betaine but yet we can still see that significant age-related increase for homocysteine now on the left i didn't show what happens to homocysteine to people older than 80 years old and that's what we can see here in this study of more than 1700 centenarians so these people had a median age of 100 years we can see that serum levels of homocysteine were almost double what they are on the chart above it 23.1 micromolar now the centenarian data actually argues against the role of homocysteine on longevity in other words it suggests that high homocysteine and potentially m torque 1 activation doesn't limit lifespan but when considering that mtorq1 is associated with a whole bunch of adverse health related conditions would centenarian health be better with lower homocysteine and correspondingly less mtorque 1 activation so with that in mind what i commonly hear is that reducing homocysteine should be easy just add folate b12 and or trimethylglycine so let's take a look at why i don't think that's the best strategy if the goal is longevity and to do that let's take a look at homocysteine metabolism so dietary folic acid or dietary folate will be converted to serum folate and in the in the presence of vitamin b12 we'll convert homocysteine into methionine so it's true that folate and b12 will result in a homocysteine lowering effect thereby increasing methionine similarly betaine or trimethylglycine and note that choline also feeds into the betaine pathway will combine with homocysteine to also form methionine so folate b12 and or trimethylglycine all should be able to reduce homocysteine but will get an increase in methionine and that may not be good for longevity because as we know from the animal studies methionine restriction not an increase in methionine extends lifespan also in human data plasma levels of methionine in centenarians so these people these are people that had an average age of 97 years were significantly lower when compared with their offspring who had an average age of 67 years and note that this paper and all the papers in the video will be in the video's description so centenarians had a significantly lower average value of plasma methionine when compared with the younger age group people that were 30 years younger now note that there are no error bars on this chart which weren't reported in the paper supplementary table six for whatever reason but the average levels were significantly different based on how they reported in the paper so nonetheless centenarians in the study had relatively lower levels of plasma methionine when compared with people that were 30 years younger now a an approach that i think may be better is using serine the amino acid serine plus b6 to reduce homocysteine which would convert it into cis defining cis defining in the presence of b6 will then be converted into the amino acid cysteine which can then be incorporated into gsh which is glutathione and if you're familiar with this channel you know that glutathione extends lifespan and it in a couple of randomized controlled trials glutathione restoration improves a whole bunch of health related outcomes so having relatively higher glutathione during aging may be a good thing and then another metabolism site that is making its first appearance on this channel h2s hydrogen sulfide and why that may be important is because hydrogen sulfide may be able to act as a sulfur donor note the s there and if it can act as a sulfur donor i would expect that i should be able to get an increased conversion of dhea into dhea sulfate and if you're also familiar familiar with the channel you know that my dhea sulfate levels are not youthful they're relatively aged so with that in mind the goal for the next test until the next test is to supplement with serine plus vitamin b6 2 grams of serine per day five milligrams of vitamin b6 per day and i think that that may be able to reduce homocysteine and potentially increase dhea sulfate now note that these are relatively low doses because i only want to impact homocysteine and or dhea sulfate i don't want to mess up anything else so the question is will it work so for that uh my next blood test will be in a few weeks sometime in mid to late april and then if it doesn't work the plan is to potentially go higher to double the searing and double the vitamin b6 intake for test number four in 2023 but i should note that that assumes that 2 grams of serine and five milligrams of b6 won't send my biomarkers in crazy directions i i don't know if that's true or not we'll have to see how the data looks now the last note here note that b6 is also involved in new synthesis the novo synthesis of nad and if it's if b6 is deficient i would expect to have relatively lower levels of nad so then that raises the question will having relatively higher b6 i'll have more than double compared with without supplementation will that impact my intracellular levels of nad without supplementing with niacin nmn or nr and i've got some nad quantification kits coming so i'll have results for that sometime in the next few weeks all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount link for nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
