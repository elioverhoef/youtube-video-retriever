# p-Cresyl And Indoxyl Sulfates Are Gut Bacteria-Derived Metabolites That May Be Bad For Longevity

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Parral sulfate and indoxyl sulfate are gut bacteria derived metabolites that negatively impact the kidney heart and endothelium and that's what we'll see here so starting in the colon or more specifically inside the gut lumen this is the inside of the tube or inside of the intestine proteins that make their way to the large intestine are digested into peptides and then those peptides are converted into amino acids in this case tyrosine and tryptophan which are converted by gup bacteria into parresol so tyrosine is converted into parresol by gut bacteria and tryptophan is converted into indol also by gut bacteria so an increase in levels of these metabolites in the intestinal epithelial cells can either then defuse or be transported into the bloodstream and more specifically the portal circulation which connects the intestine to the liver so now the liver has elevated levels of parresol and indox or indol so indol is converted into indox under oxidative conditions but that's into the weeds that's a mechanism for another day so the liver attempts to detoxify these gut bacteria derived metabolites by adding sulfate groups so now we've got parral sulfate and indoxyl sulfate and one way to reduce circulating levels of these metabolites is by binding to albumin and that's potentially important because free levels of parral sulfate and endox sulfate in blood damage the liver heart and endothelium now now unfortunately albumin levels decline during aging which is one way that levels of parral sulfate and ad oxal sulfate can be increased in the blood during aging another is that the kidney is supposed to remove these metabolites but kidney function declines during aging so parral sulfate pcs and indoxyl sulfate is accumulate when kidney function is suboptimal and accordingly levels of these two metabolites increase during aging and that's what we'll see here so levels of indoxyl sulfate and cal sulfate on the left and then we've got data for people who are younger than 65 years and older than 65 years on the left and right respectively and then for both of these metabolites these are circulating levels we can see that indoxyl sulfate increases from 1.22 to 1.55 micromolar and pcs or parral sulfate increases from 3.83 to 4.9 micromolar in people younger than versus older than 65 and these differences are statistically significant as you can see the p value in both both cases is less than 0.05 so in addition to these age related increases for pcs and is they're also associated with an increased all cause mortality risk which is what we'll see here so on the top of the y- axis we've got tyrosine derived compounds and there's parresol sulfate and on the bottom we've got tryptophan derived compounds and there we've got indoxyl sulfate on the x-axis we've got the hazard ratio so risk of death for all causes and then in terms of what signific we put up a red line at that hazard ratio of one remember where the 95% conf confidence invol that's the horizontal line to the left and right of the open circles the unfilled white circles if that's completely to the right or completely to the left of that hazard ratio of one we have a significant association so we can see that for both parral sulfate its 95% confidence interval is completely to the right of one as it is for indoxyl sulfate so both of these metabolites are significantly associated with an incre increased risk of death for all causes now the good news is that these metabolites can be tracked which means they can be potentially optimized and to do that i've been using atome metabolomics with iolo's kit which besides these two metabolites includes 600 plus others and if you want to use this kit yourself discount link in the video's description so what's my data so starting with the data for plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate that's there and then parresol sulfate that's also there on on the bottom and these data are from april of 2023 through july of 2024 i have 11 tests and as you can see by that blue blue line the trend line is going in the wrong direction ideally i'd want it to be flat i want to resist age related change even if it's only for a 14 or so or 15mon period so they're moving in the wrong direction or they have at least more recently so what's the plan for reducing levels of these metabolites so for that let's go to the correlations so now we're going to take a look at 11 test correlations for indoxyl and parral sulfate with diet so correlations for indoxyl sulfate and parral sulfate there on the right so how am i able to calculate correlations for diet with these metabolites what's the approach and i've documented this in many other videos most recently for torine if you missed that i'll link to that in the right corner so following test number 11 i looked at correlations for indoxyl sulfate and parral sulfate with 87 foods macro and micronutrients and then in terms of what's significant we go to the p value you can see in both cases they're less than 0.05 on both tables and this is a partial list the full list as for all correlations is on the correlations tier on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out in terms of the correlation we go to the lowercase r that's the correlation coefficient now the biggest bang for the buck in my how i'm interpreting this is i'm looking for foods or nutrients that are significantly correlated with both of these metabolites and in that case we can see that macadamia nuts have positive correlations for both in other words a relatively higher macadamia nut intake is significant correlated with higher levels of indoxyl and parol sulfate in my data so with that in mind for test number 13 i've reduced intake of macadamia nuts and if macadamia nuts somehow are causatively involved i should expect to see lower levels of indoxyl and parral sulfate or at least the correlation will weaken if that's not the case alternatively and inversely we can see that uh mushrooms and vitamin b5 so mushrooms are a rich source of vitamin b5 so that's probably the b5 correlation is probably an a marker of mushroom intake we can see that mushrooms and b5 are inversely correlated with indoxyl and paracel sulfate so during periods where i've had high intake of mushrooms levels of these metabolites were relatively low so with that in mind for test number 13 i've increased mushroom intake and note for a couple note that for a couple test i reduced mushroom intake to test correlations with homosysteine and that it turned out to be maybe a part of the story so i'm happy to increase mushrooms back up by a bit so i cut mushroom intake from three 700 uh 700 gr boxes per week to one for the homeless experiment so now i've increased increased it back to two not yet fully at three which will test this correlation but then the most interesting correlation or at least to me on this list is coconut butter and here too this is an inverse correlation so during periods where i've had relatively higher coconut butter intake that's significantly correlated with lower levels of both of these two metabolites so now i've said that this is a potentially interesting correlation because now i have a conundrum and for those who are familiar with the channel you've seen my videos on horath horath sorry horvath's epigenetic age and the dna methylation uh based estimation of tiir length where coconut butter is inversely correlated with on horvath epigenetic age in other words relatively higher intake of coconut butter is significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age and horvath's epigenetic clock is the gold standard and it's the best epigenetic epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age and coconut butter is posit uh positively correlated sorry it inversely correlated with a uh tiir length so higher coconut butter is correlated with a shorter te length so that would suggest that coconut butter is bad for those two epigenetic markers so now we've got the opposite data where a relatively higher coconut butter intake may be better for levels of these two metabolites that are associated with all cause mortality risk and damage to the kidney heart and endothelium so i have a conundrum do i increase coconut butter improve levels of these two metabolites or reduce them resist age related change but maybe make the epigenetics worse and then it also raises another question which do i value more these metabolite markers which are uh markers of what's happening or has recently happened or the epigenetics which may be a marker of what can happen rather than what is happening for now i'm favoring the metab metabolomics over the epigenetics and i'm happy to have that discussion in the comments if anyone's interested in more info all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biack aging check us out on patreon which includes those biomarker correlations and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself while also helping to support the channel including discount links for at home metabolomics ulta labs which is where i get the majority of my blood tests epigenetic testing ned quantification oral microbiome composition at home blood testing with sciox health which includes aple b but also grimage the dna
