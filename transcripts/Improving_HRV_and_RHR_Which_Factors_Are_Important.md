# Improving HRV and RHR: Which Factors Are Important?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that i've been able to increase heart rate variability from an average of 47 milliseconds per day in 2018 to an average of 66.6 milliseconds per day thus far in the first half of 2024 which is a 41% increase similarly over that same time span i've been able to reduce resting heart rate from an average of about 51 beats per minute in 2018 to an average of 42 beats per minute in 2024 first half of 2024 which is an 18% decrease so in today's video we'll take a look at which factors may be contributing to these improvements for a relatively higher heart rate variability and a lower resting heart rate over that 6-e plus period so the most obvious place to start is with physical activity so to track physical activity rather than looking at steps which says nothing about the intensity of the effort and contrast i've been using the average daily heart rate as a metric of daily physical activity and we prov provides that data i'm not here to promote whoop i'm not sure if other fitness variables provide that metric but i've been tracking the average daily heart rate adhr and looking at correlations with resting heart rate and heart rate variability so with that in mind what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with the next day resting heart rate and to address that we'll take a look at about 1,500 days of data unfortunately i didn't start tracking this until march of 2020 i wish i' had the idea to start tracking it sooner in 2018 18 nonetheless 1,500 or so days of data and that's what we'll see here on the x-axis we've got the previous days average daily heart rate plotted against the next day resting heart rate and then we can see a significant positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 note that by definition anything greater than 0.7 is considered a strong correlation in terms of the p value we can see that it's far below 0.05 at 4 * 10 the - 272 power what this suggests is that too much daily activity and too often will be bad for the resting heart rate all right what about heart rate variability so over the same time span around 1500 days of data from march of 2020 through the end of june 2024 that's what we'll see here and now we can see a significant inverse correlation with a correlation coefficient of negative 0.53 not as strong as the correlation for the average daily heart rate with resing heart rate but significant nonetheless as you can see the p value is 2 * 10 1115th power far below 0.05 so here here too this suggests that too much daily activity and too often will be bad for heart rate variability and taken together these data suggest that with a higher average daily heart rate that will lead to chronically worse heart rate variability and resting heart rate so with that in mind finding finding the balance between active and rest days is is important for optimizing both resting heart rate and heart rate variability if i'm just working out every day and not allowing for these metrics to recover they'll be chronically overtrained in other words a lower heart rate variability with a higher resting heart rate so what does that look like in terms of finding the balance so for me and following these data following uh resting heart rate and heart rate variability with the goal of getting them towards youthful values i'm currently on or i've been on for a few years two 90-minute workouts per week these workouts are full body essentially circuit training based i don't take rest sets and you know rest periods and sit and watch and screw around on the phone i don't do any of that it's basically circuit training for those whole 90 minutes compound movement focused overhead press shoulder pr uh uh pull-ups seated rows uh push-ups off a ball dead lifts step weighted step ups and then a whole bunch of mobility flexibility taekwon do stuff a whole bunch of stuff with the goal of optimizing basically every range of motion that each joint can go through so what does that look like in terms of the average daily heart rate and finding the balance between wrestling heart rate and heart rate variability for when to train and and or when to do the next workout so starting with the active day this would generally be on a friday you can see that my average daily heart rate on that day was 56 beats per minute and then i purposefully titrate activity lower over the next two days as you can see it was 54 and then 52 beats per minute and as a total for the day that may may not seem like a very high average daily heart rate for the day but note that my average resling heart rate generally ranges from 40 to 42 beats per minute so on the active day it's 14 to 16 beats per minute above my resting value all right and then after those two tit trated lower days generally saturday and sunday i would then do a monday workout and you can see that 56 beats per minute for the average daily heart rate is a bump up from the 52 and then generally take three recovery days or three lower intensity days which is just basically like walking nothing too crazy in terms of intensity or effort as i'm trying to allow enough time for resting heart rate heart rate var variability to recover while also allowing for recovery from each workout in terms of you know muscle soreness or fatigue so it's generally a monday friday based workout but there is some variability depending on how the data look for heart rate variability and resting heart rate for example for the past workout on friday i cut that to half of the usual 90 minutes because the data was already trending in the overtrained ction so i didn't want to overdo it so i cut the workout in half i try to avoid that as much as possible because cutting these 90 workouts uh in half over time potentially can lead to a detraining effect potentially also negatively impacting heart rate variability and resting heart rate so i try to stick to the 90-minute workout plan as much as possible but i do allow some uh time to bend the workouts in terms of intensity and duration um based on how the data for heart rate variability and resting heart rate look all right but note that physical activity isn't the only variable that may impact resting heart rate and heart rate variability so with that in mind what's the relationship for body weight with these cardiovascular fitness metrics so note that i've weighed myself every morning after using the bathroom going number one and number two and fasted and i have data going back to 2018 so then we can look at correlations for the daily resting heart rate with body weight and i have now approaching almost 2200 days of data which is what we'll see here on the y- ais we've got the resting heart rate plotted against body weight and then we can see a significant positive correlation once again this is a strong correlation as that correlation coefficient is greater than 0.7 at 0.73 and the p value at zero seems like an error but i use two different statistical programs to evaluate that it came up with zero in excel and then i entered the data into stats kingdom.com and using uh also pierce and product correlations it came up a zero so it's essentially the p value is so low you know 10 to the negative maybe 300th power that it's essentially zero highly significant association for body weight with the resting heart rate in my data so what does that mean well as the as my body weight has been higher that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate and conversely when my body weight has been at my leanest around 138 lbs resting heart rate has approached 40 beats per minute all right what about heart rate variability so over those same about 2200 days of data we can see that here and now we've got a significant inverse correlation al albeit the correlation isn't as strong as the correlation for body weight with resting heart rate as it's 0.46 but it's a significant correlation nonetheless at 2 * 10 the10th power and here we can this suggests that as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability and conversely at my leanest or my lightest as body weight has approached 138 lbs heart rate variability has approached relatively youthful values of 70 milliseconds so to answer the question what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate and heart rate variability from both of these plots we can see that they approach youthful values as body weight decreases all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where rather than seeing three-month updates this is my first heart rate variability resting heart rate update in about 3 months i post daily data for resting heart rate heart rate variability the average daily heart rate and also sleep stages so if you're interested in that check it out we've also got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with soft fox health which includes aobb but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the
