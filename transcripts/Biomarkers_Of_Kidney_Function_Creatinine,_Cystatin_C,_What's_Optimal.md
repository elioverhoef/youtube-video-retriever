# Biomarkers Of Kidney Function: Creatinine, Cystatin C, What's Optimal?

## Transcript

Kidney function declines during aging and that's what we can see here on the y- axis we've got gfr estimate or egfr as a biomarker of kidney function plotted against age on the x-axis and this is from about 18 years old to 95 years old and for both men and women we can see declines for egfr again is a biomarker of kidney function now inherent in this measurement is creatinine as creatinine is used to derive egfr now blood levels of cre accumulate in the presence of poor kidney function but they also increase during aging which is what we can see here on the y- ais we got we have serum creatinine plotted against age and again this is from about 18 to 90 years old and here we can see that age related increase for serum creatinine levels but creatinine may not be the best estimator of kidney function in people older than 40 years and that's in part because of a wide creatinine variability for people old older than 40 you can see that some people older than 40 have values as high as 14 mig per deciliter or compared with people younger than 40 where that variability doesn't exist now a couple of factors may be underlying the variability for creatinine during aging and one of them is because creatinine is proportional to muscle mass which is what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got circulating levels of creatinine plotted against muscle mass and here we can see that significant association between the two variables in other words high muscle mass is correlated with higher circulating levels of creatinine and conversely lower muscle mass is significantly correlated with lower levels of circulating levels of creatinine now note that muscle mass declines during aging so now we have two opposing factors going on so aging is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and when considering the association for muscle mass with creatinine also lower creatinine but aging uh is also associated with higher creatinine thereby highlighting reduced kidney function as we we know that creatinine accumulates when kidney function is relatively poor so when considering these potential limitations for creatinine studies have shown that catin c may be a better better biom sorry better biomarker of kidney function and i won't go into that data in this video i want to focus on age related changes and all cause mortality risk for csta and c so first what's optimal in terms of age related changes and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got circulating levels of caty plotted against age and this is from from about 30 to 100 years old and in people who have no clinical risk factors but note that the data for people who do have clinical risk factors is the same s a similar slope we can see that there is an age related increase for cat and c now in youth cat and c is characterized by values pretty close to 0.7 mg per liter all right so what about all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got survival probability plotted against survival time and note that this is after the initial assessment of catin c up to about 18 years later who was still alive and who died so when compared with people who had initial cattiny levels of 7 milligram per liter we can see that almost all of those people after about 16 to 17 years were still alive in contrast people who had cattiny levels that were greater than 1.08 milligram per liter about 50% of that population died about 17 to 18 years later so from this chart from these data we can see that relatively higher syat and c is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk now systat and c is also a top predictor of biological age and we can see that in this study and note that this study didn't have any pretty pictures to illustrate that point but i linked to its paper and all the other papers in the video's description what we're looking at here though is on the y- axis we've got uh demographics and biomarkers and how they associate with all cause mortality risk with higher levels of the biom marker being associated with an increased all cause mortality risk in red and then higher levels of the biomarker being associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk in blue so a top the list it shouldn't be a surprise that chronological age is a top predictor or is has the strongest association with all cause mortality risks so the older we live the increased chance of death that we have unfortunately as a second uh second close to age is being a man so that shouldn't be a surprise either as women are well known to live longer than men so being a man had there's an increased all cause mortality risk relative to women but note that the top uh predictor in terms of being associated with all cause mortality risk is then is not metabolic health i.e glucose or hba1c glycated hemoglobin it's catin c at least in this study so we can see that catin c is more strongly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk relative to glucose and hba1c in this population and second place though is the red blood cell distribution with or rdw and for those that are familiar with the channel that the rdw shouldn't be a surprising name as that that's a top predictor of biological age using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator feno and i'll have more on the rdw in the next video now also note that the top predictor for a reduced all cause mortality risk is creatinine and one reason for that may be knowing that higher muscle mass is significantly correlated with higher creatinine this this may be a higher muscle mass is associated with a lower risk of death for all causes story now a major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and when considering that ca c may be a better biomarker relative to creatinine and when considering catin c seems to be a quote unquote powerful predictor of all cause mortality risk that brings us to what's my data so for the january 15 2024 test i measured it for the first time and it's relatively youthful better than age expected 0.72 mig per liter so kidney function at this point is not a weakness in my data i've got other weaknesses in my data but for now kidney function is not one of them all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification or a microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with side fox health which includes apob and a totally different profile or almost totally different profile than the adome metabolomics green tea die tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die ching brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
