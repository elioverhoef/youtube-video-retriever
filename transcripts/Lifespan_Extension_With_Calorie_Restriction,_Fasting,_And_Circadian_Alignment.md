# Lifespan Extension With Calorie Restriction, Fasting, And Circadian Alignment

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that fasting drives the lifespan extending effect of cal restriction cr so let's take a look at that data as it sets us up for a larger story so here we're looking at percent survival how many light a mice were alive or dead and then age at death and there are three groups cr calorie restricted so this is 30 calorie restriction and mice ate all of their food within a two hour eating window and then fasted for the remaining 22 hours in the day then we've got ad lib uh so these mice ate as much as they wanted when whenever they wanted and i should mention that these data are in c57 uh black six j male mice uh unfortunately the study didn't go into uh data on female mice and then there's a third group diluted ad lib so uh this is 30 also 30 calorie restriction but without fasting so the mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted but the diet was diluted the ad-lib diet was diluted such that the total amount of calories was the same as 30 cr all right so let's look at median lifespan this is also known as 50 survival this is when half the colony has died and half is still alive so for calorie restriction we can see that there's a significant 20 increase for median lifespan for the cr group the 30 cr group that also had a very short eating window in contrast and that's when compared with the ad-lib diet as shown there in gray in contrast the cr group that was 30 but without prolonged fasting had a significant decrease in lifespan of nine percent so that raises the question is cr without fasting bad for lifespan or prolonged lifespan uh prolonged fasting so alternatively though can lifespan be further increased in fasted cr mice and one one way we may be able to do that is through circadian alignment now for mice circadian alignment means eating during the night not the day and that's because mice are nocturnal the majority of their physical activity is during the night time not the daytime so uh and note that most studies in mice are conducted during the day not night so there's a lot of circadian misalignment going on in most mouse studies so with that in mind what's the effect of fasting and circadian alignment on lifespan in calorie-restricted mice and that data was published here in a a recently published paper if you're interested in this paper and the paper on the last slide it'll be in the video's description so there's a lot of data on this slide so let's unpack it piece by piece so once again we're looking at percent survival on the y-axis plotted against age so uh how long did the mice live and then when starting off with median survival as shown there we can see the ad-lib group which again is nazi yard these mice were eating as much as they wanted whenever they wanted we can see that they had a median lifespan of 792 days as indicated by the gray line so then the next group was cr spread and this is 30 calorie restriction but with but without prolonged fasting so the mice were given food nine times during a 24 hour period so there was a little bit less than three hours in between each meal and that's shown in purple and even with without prolonged fasting with it we can see that there was a significant increase in median lifespan for the 30 cr group uh the cr spread that didn't have any prolonged fasts or at least longer than about three hours all right so what about so so then we can go into the showing this data 30 cr median lifespan increase versus the ad lib we can see that without prolonged fasting there was a 10 percent increase significant increase for median lifespan so what about maximalized ben so we can see that the the last mouse that died looks later than the gray line the ad lib but most studies you uh report 10 survival so this is um 90 90 of the colony has died and only 10 is still alive it isn't when was the age of death at the last uh for the last animal between groups so when looking at 10 survival again 90 of the colony died and only 10 was still alive you can see by the p-value when comparing the cr spread versus ad lib it's greater than 0.05 so there wasn't a significant difference in maximum lifespan for the cr spread group when compared with ad lib all right so then that brings us to the cr during the day groups and this this again is 30 calorie restriction with a 12 or 22 hour fast but note that since it's during the day the animals are eating during the day this is circadian misalignment and you can see that for the cr day group in yellow where it says two hours that means that their eating window was two hours and then they fasted for the remaining 22 hours in the day so for that group for the cr day group we can see an even longer median lifespan as shown there so somewhere around 950 days we're compared with 792 for ad lib and that's a 20 increase uh for median lifespan so what about maximum lifespan and here too uh there was an increase in maximum lifespan for the cr day groups both uh 22 hour fast and the 12 hour fast when compared with the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted so last but not least and this is why we're here is the cr at night group so the mice were only allowed to eat at night so this again was 30 cr with a 12 or 22 hour fast and this would could be defined as circadian alignment so when looking at the survival curves there in blue and green we can see that the longest median lifespan was for this group for the cr night group again that has fasting prolonged fasting and circadian alignment and we can see that there it was a 35 percent increase in median lifespan note that for media meaning like median lifespan data of around 1050 or 1060 days most supplement based studies don't even have maximum lifespans uh that reach those uh you know that those amounts of days or months so uh this is an impressive finding a 35 increase in median lifespan for fasting prolonged fasting plus circadian alignment on a cr diet and also in terms of maximum lifespan we can see that it was also significantly increased i put the p values there when compared with the ad-lib diet so then this also raises the question is the shortest eating window optimal for longevity should we all be eating a two-hour all of all of our food within two hours or is 12-hour a 12-hour eating window sufficient for uh increasing lifespan so based on the data in the cr day and at cr9 there was no added additive effect or there was no increase in survival for having a two-hour eating window versus a 12-hour eating window so when looking at the orange and yellow curves you can see that median lifespan looks pretty close to identical and similarly for the green and and and blue curves you can see again median lifespan is basically overlapping at 50 survival whether it's a two hour eating all the food within two hours or within 12 hours so with that it would seem that if we have a 12 hour eating window that may be sufficient for optimizing lifespan if we're on a cr diet and we optimize our circadian rhythm so that's then the bigger question in people with circadian alignment equal eating most of the food in the morning afternoon or before bed and there's very little data uh definitely no data in terms of lifespan and people uh but if we were going to speculate i'd bet that eating almost all of the food from sun up to sundown at the latest may be optimal in people um so with that in mind i try to finish everything around four o'clock at the latest some days as early as one o'clock uh most of my eating window all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed you enjoyed the video have a great day
