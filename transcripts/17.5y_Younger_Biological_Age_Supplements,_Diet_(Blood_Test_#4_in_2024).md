# 17.5y Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Blood Test #4 in 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number four in 2024 when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag we saw that my biological age was 17 1 12 years younger than the chronological so what may be contributing to these data in terms of prescription meds for those who are familiar with the channel it's not a surprise but for those who may be new welcome i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin for about half my life all right so that brings us to supplements the first is also a standard vitamin d 1,000 iuse per day in the non-summer months when i'm not able to get full body sun exposure and note that this is 29 of the 29 days and that correspond to this test in other words i took it for every day from the last blood test which was on april 29th blood test number three in 2024 through the day before test number four on may 27th so from one blood test to the last that's the dietary period that corresponds to this test i also supplemented with branch chain amino acids lucine isoline and veine 5 g per day to test the hypothesis or to test the correlation at least in my data that a relatively higher protein intake is significantly correlated with lower homosysteine so to more directly test that i added branch chain amino acids into the approach 5 gram per day for the last 14 days of this period to see if that could lower homosysteine and unfortunately it didn't i may give it it its own video but uh for for now we know that going highd do branch chain amino acids didn't impact homoy at least in my data and then i usually supplement with nicotinic acid to help keep ned levels around 40 micromolar but for this test it was only one of those 29 days now for the next test it will be there and that's only until trigonelline which is now sold as a supplement arrives so i'm going to continue the experiments looking at trigonelline as a potential way to impact nad only this time using supplements as i've pretty much exhausted all dietary means to try to impact ned through trigonelline all right so that's it for supplements no other purported geo protectors or senol linic so that brings us to diet and more specifically what diet composition corresponds to this test where i was 17 1 12 years younger relative to the chronological and that's what we'll see here and again these are 29 this is the 29 day average from the last blood test through the day before this test and for those who are unfamiliar with the approach i weigh all of my food i've documented that approach in a recent video so if you missed it it'll be in the right corner so for the first half of the diet that's what we can see here this list is ranked in a in grams from highest to lowest with the exception of green te which is an ounces and if you want to use what i use there's an updated uh discount link in the video's description all right so for every test i include experiments with the goal of improving a couple of the weak spots including horvath seppi genetic age homoy dhea sulfate and thyroid hormones as a few examples but i don't want to blow up the overall approach as we saw on the last slide that my biomarker data for the most part is youthful so i'd like to improve the weak spots without messing up the rest of the approach so what experiments did i do on that road so for blood test number two remember this is test number four the chronological age minus biological age difference was my best ever over 33 tests at 192 years younger so as a part of that uh alala sprouts were a part of that story or potentially a part of that story i don't know if it's causitive all i can do is follow the correlations now for that test before testing for test number two i averaged 120 grams of alala sprouts per day whereas for the test number three i reduced it and my biological age got a bit worse it was 16.1 years younger so for this test to see if i could get back to the 19 1/2 year reduction i increased alala sprouts up past the 120 g per day to 147 g per day and that's in comparison with the last test which was about 69 g per day now to increase that i reduced clover sprouts the reason clover sprouts were in the approach was to potentially impact ned via trigonelline which didn't work um if you saw i don't know if i made that video yet but it was 19 something micromolar with uh doubling the clover sprout intake uh so it didn't work so out clover sprouts went up went alala sprouts and we can see the clover sprout decreased to 30 g from about 73 gs per day for test number three i also doubled chickpeas back to where they were for test number two and that's from uh 2 43 g per day from about 22 g per day and to get that calorie increase to keep it calorie neutral or somewhat calorie neutral i took eggs out or reduced their intake as i i had increased eggs to try to push ld higher for the ldl d and pace experiment i wasn't able to increase ldl and i don't want to go higher than 5 eggs per day and granted i hear you in the comments saying go even higher than five eggs per day but remember i'm trying to improve a few weak spots without blowing up the overall approach and i think if i go higher than five eggs per day for now that may uh start to blow up the overall approach all right i also increased peanut intake to 32 g per day from 24 now one reason is because of tryptophan betane other words that's trimethyl tryptophan so it's tryptophan with three methyl groups which could act as a potential methyl donor at least for hom assistin it didn't but there's another reason why i've included peanuts into the approach or increase them and i'm going to continue to keep them relatively high and that's because they're a rich source of the longchain saturated fatty acid c24 24 carbon saturated fatty acid called lignoceric acid and as you'll see in an upcoming video peanuts are a great source of that they're a great way to increase plasma levels of that fatty acid which has been associated with a reduced brain aging with a a younger brain age and we all want to have a younger brain age so peanuts and this fatty acid lignoceric acid i'd like to have relatively high levels and again assuming association equals uh causation which i again i don't know you know all i can do is keep it relatively high and hope for the best right all right i also increased olives so there's a lot of buzz online a lot of snake oil about olive oil uh being the elixir somewhat of an elixir of longevity and that's based on studies where olive oil may be more favorable than other oils to include in the diet but i find it hard to believe that including olive olive oil in high amounts the processed food relative to the whole food olives will be best for health so if you've if you're familiar with the channel then you know that olive oil has zero role in my diet but olives had have had a very small role in my diet for a very long time so to see if they can do anything impact any biomarkers i've increased olive intake as we'll see on the next slide from about uh 3 g per day now to 23 an average of 23 g per day so that's about a 7x increase and we'll see if that makes a dent on biomarkers going forward as i plan to uh test this hypothesis for increasing olive intake for a few tests going forward all right so then we can see that there were 22 foods on the left but then 27 on the right right which means i took some stuff out so for this test i took out cinnamon cloves oats and onion for various reasons and because the blood test data was a bit worse for test number three relative to test number four i'm going to keep those foods back in granted probably a smaller amounts uh uh going forward for test number five and beyond all right so what about the second half of the diet diet intake list which is what we can see here and we're going to compare it to test number three data so i also increased sano peppers as a source of spice and that's because spicy foods or spicy peppers have been associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk so i'll likely cover that story in an upcoming video so i basically added them every day one small uh pepper they may actually be fresno peppers they're the red version um but i've been logging them as sano i i don't think chronometer includes fresno or dietary data for uh fresno sometimes it doesn't have the macros and micros or micros sorry so i i average 10 gram for day and that's up from about 1 g per day all right what about cheat meals so for those who are familiar with the channel you know that i try to stick to no more than two cheat meals for a given period but for this test i'd been craving uh increasing intake of certain foods that i've been keeping relatively low like coconut butter and caca uh cacao beans so for this test i decided to in increase those amounts for a couple days so uh following the blood test immediately after the blood test i did that and then the day after as if they were cheat meals essentially they're not cheap meals they're whole food but i pay no attention or very minimal attention to macros and micros on those two days so i'm basically laxed with the diet eating more of what i want relative to uh other days when i'm more of on a structured approach but but to sweeten it up i did add sugar just the simple sugar glucose to uh mixes with coconut butter and cacao beans so that's a processed food right so that's technically junk so how many calories did the sugar contribute to the 29-day period so it's about 213 calories that came from sugar just adding raw sugar to to the uh two days of those cheat meals which when divided by the total calorie intake for this 29-day period is 3% of all calories so the diet is 99 or was 99.7% clean for test number four all right so this is this list is ranked in grams what about top contributors in terms of calories and that's what we'll see here this is the top 10 food for average daily calorie intake for those 29 days and this list is generated with chronometer if you want to track your own diet with chronometer there's a discount link in the video's description so in terms of the food that provided the most calories on a daily basis it's sardines this shouldn't be a surprise that's been the top food for many tests going back many years and in terms of the other foods in this top 10 list we can see that nine of the 10 foods are the same as they were for test number three again i mentioned that the goal is to not blow up the system but to make relatively small changes to improve the weak spots and not blow up the system now one of those foods that changed was brazil nuts as i try to increase brazil brazil nut intake with the goal of increasing dietary selenium to about the upper tolerable limit of 400 micrograms per day with the goal of impacting the free t3 to free t4 ratio thyroid hormones all right what about macronutrients how did that how do they correspond to test number four so starting with calorie intake average daily calorie intake was 2118 and that's actually the first test over the last 3 years where i've increased calorie intake that's a 40 calorie per day increase which may not seem like much but for 21 consecutive tests i had sequentially reduced calorie intake purposely reduced calorie intake to see what effect it would have on biomarkers now i stopped that for this test and probably for the next next test going forward as my current average daily calorie intake is currently a bit above 218 for a couple of reasons one of them being shbg and uh free testosterone uh another being uh red blood cells in hemoglobin which may tie into the shbg story and then also potentially for the free t3 to free t4 ratio which didn't budge much with this small change but we'll see how that goes for the next test in terms of average daily protein intake including the branch chain amino acids it was about 105 g per day which is about 20% of calories for the for this test in terms of fat intake average daily fat intake was about 93 g per day which is 39% of total calories and we can see how that compares against test number three which was a small increase relative to the 90 gam per day that i average for test number three and i did that on purpose as again i was trying to push fat and cholesterol intake higher for test number three to increase ldl to test the correlation for ldl with duneden pace the epigenetic pace of aging but ldl stayed on the high end of my of my range it didn't go higher i was hoping to get it to around 95 or so so i'm going to pause that experiment for now because higher fat in my data and again i'm not anti-fat for others in my data for whatever reason it's significantly correlated with an older epigenetic age as indicated by horvath and higher glucose i had one of my higher glucose readings over the past 52 tests at 98 and fat intake for whatever reason is significant correlated with that in my data so i'm going to cut it down to about 85 g per day and we'll see if the data improves in terms of where the fat was coming from we can see that i purposefully held omega3 and omega 6 constant as i was trying to play around with levels of saturated fat which i reduced by a small amount and increased monounsaturated fat and for the next test i'll play play around with those two a bit more further reducing saturated fat while increasing monounsaturated fat as in my data the correlations and again all correlations with diet with bl blood biomarkers are on the correlation here on patreon monounsaturated is significant correlated with more blood and other biomarkers going in the wrong a right direction than wrong relative to saturated fat so to test that i'm going to increase monounsaturated fat more so coming from peanuts and i've added macadamia nuts into the approach while cutting down coconut butter to see if uh what that does to the biomarkers especially horvath and glucose all right next up carbon tip total carbs were 259 g per day which may seem like a lot but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake daily fiber intake for this test was 88 g per day so when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 172 g per day when sub multiplying that by 4 calories per gram we get a net carbs of 32% of the total diet now within fiber note that a percentage of that about 20% is soluble which means that it's fermented by gut bacteria soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids or scfas more specifically about 180 calories from fiber is converted into fats so that 8.5% can be added to the 39% for total fat to to give net macros as shown here about 48% of the diet is fat or for this test it was fat about 32% net carbs and about 20% was protein now within net carbs or within carbs carbs i track sugar intake but uh more specifically with that i track total fructose and that's because the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables and also total fructose in my data is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and again those correlations and all correlations for diet with biomarkers are on the correlations tier on patreon now sucrose is half fructose so we divide that by two and add that to fructose we get a total fructose for this test of 56 g per day now they may that may seem like a lot but that's actually my lowest fructose intake since i started tracking in 2015 which was 575 gram per day now i might be able to go a bit lower than that it's a challenge to go lower because i'll have to cut fruit intake in my case fruit is very satiating and in my opinion or from my experience a big approach of sticking to a diet long term is satiety and actually satiety is probably a a major uh focus for being able to be calorie restricted which is my goal i want to be calorie restricted and also as lean as possible so i'm cutting fruit intake with the goal of cutting fructose i'm now on that very fine line of am i satiated and if i'm not satiated that may lead to more calories so i'm not trying to increase calories more than by a small amount and on intentionally not because i've lost quote unquote willpower because i have i'm not satiated so i i think i can go a bit lower for fructose but be by a very small amount and let's see if that makes a dent on biomarkers all right what about micronutrients how do they correspond to this test so we've got the full vitamin list here it might be hard to see so i'd encourage going full screen if you haven't already now note that there is full rda coverage for those who may be sleuthing and going through it one by one note that choline at 451 uh milligrams per day is less than the rda of about 500 but chronometer doesn't provide micronutrient data for sardines and if you add the sardines which provide about 70 micro uh milligrams of choline per day i'm above that 500 or so milligram per day target for coline but for anyone starting on this journey that's what i would encourage full rda coverage for all vitamins and minerals at the bare minimum at the very least and then see what clears up in the biomarkers after that but then the big question is and especially if you look at my data why are so many micronutrients purposefully higher than the rda and that's because i'm following their correlations with that panel of at least 25 biomarkers actually i've expanded it to include the epigenetics and metabolomic so it's a lot more than those 25 biomarkers for now now the one that i usually highlight the most is vitamin k and on this list you can see it's at the bottom and it's about 2500 micrograms per day now i didn't settle on that m that amount arbitrarily for whatever reason vitamin k in my data is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction than wrong in terms of how they relate to aging and all ca mortality risk and for those who have been following this journey for a few years vitamin k intakes in the beginning were somewhere around, 1500 microg per day but i've been slowly titrating it upward to see to test those correlations which have stayed positive for many tests all right so for a comparison and how the minerals for this test look against test number three i just pulled that up and you can see if you go by each one they're mostly in the same ballpark with the exception of two so we can see that total nice and intake was a bit lower for this test the main reason being that i took out nicotinic acid for 28 of the 29 days and then we can also see b12 is lower and i took out supplementation of b12 to do the bcaa homosysteine experiment next up is mineral intake with mineral intake for test number four on the left and test number three on the right now first note that almost everything is in the same ballpark for all the minerals on the list test number four versus test number three with the exception of selenium now that 60 microgram increase is only because i increased brazil nuts for the last half for the 20 of the 29-day period but i've kept them relatively high with the goal of 400 micrograms per day for the selenium target so for the next test we'll see selenium at 400 micrograms per day and i did that because selenium is required for the conversion of free t4 the thyroid hormone thyroxin into free t3 triiodothyronine so to test that i've increased selenium to see if i can get an increase for the free t3 to free t4 ratio in my data now that may not work on its own i may need to add things like co-enzyme q10 there is some published data showing that combination can improve the free t3 to freet t4 ratio but that's a story for another day all right that's all for now if you're interested in
