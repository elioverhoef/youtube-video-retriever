Resting heart rate and heart rate variability what's optimal so first we're looking at a plot of the relative risk uh for all-cause mortality against the resting heart rate in beats per minute and what we can see is that a resting heart rate of about 45 beats per minute is associated with a maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk so with that in mind what's my data so i've been tracking my resting heart rate uh with a fitness tracker for almost two full years from august 2018 through june of 2020 and what we can see is that i started uh so each blue dot corresponds to the average uh resting heart rate for that month so we can see that i started with a resting heart rate around 52 to 53 and then i came down went back up and then went back down again and then went back up again so uh there's a noticeable trend here that my resting heart rate has been lowest in the winter and but highest in the summer so what's going on with that well in the summertime i suffer from uh hay fever so allergies to grass and pollen and that increases my resting heart rate for from may until july at least that's what happened in 2019 in 2020 i was better able to manage those symptoms and my resting heart rate went up less so that's the trend for me but what about in the published literature are there seasonal trends so what we're looking at here is data from 90 to 92 about 92 000 subjects and resting heart rate for uh women in the green line and for men in the blue line and what we can see is that the resting heart rate is actually lower in the summer for this cohort of 90 000 plus subjects and highest in the winter so this data is basically opposite my data and i just included that to illustrate that epi data from large epidemiological studies are important but what's more important is seeing how your data agrees with it or not and if it doesn't well you've got to figure out you know why and how then to optimize it so based on all-cause mortality risk my resting heart rate data is close to optimal so you can see it my 2020 data my average resting heart rate is around 47.48 but i didn't include how resting heart rate rhr changes during aging so let's have a look at that data so resting heart rate increases then decreases during aging and i've included data for two different studies here with basically the same trend um so we're looking at the average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age and what we can see is that uh resting heart rate peaks at about 50 in both cohorts and then declines towards the end of life so if you remember my data my resting heart rate was actually i started at a relatively high level and then over the past two years i've reduced it so how do i know that i'm i didn't peak uh and then i'm on the slow downward trend for lower resting heart rate uh towards the end of life how do i know so with that we can look at the heart rate variability for more insight about my uh cardiovascular health so first what is heart rate variability uh so the simple definition is it's the variation in time in between successive heartbeats so if your resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute on average your heart beats once every second but it's not exactly once every second some beats may be 0.9 seconds some beats maybe 1.1 seconds and some beats may be exactly one second so if you take the average of those three sure it's 1b per minute but the time in itself is is different that so that's the heart rate variability it's the variability uh in the time in between those heartbeats so we can see that illustrated here by that picture and i won't get into the math but um my fitness tracker measures heart rate variability uh with the rmssd which stands for the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats so the rm ssd why is that important uh and how does it change with age so it declines during aging and first we can see that here in a study of about 200 or of of 260 subjects the rmssd which is basically heart rate variability that's how they assessed it in this case it starts off at about 53 in young subjects 10 to 19 years old and then you can see it slowly declines for each age group until 80 to 99 year olds then have a heart rate variability of 21 so significantly decreased heart rate variability with age so these data were confirmed in another study a little bit bigger 344 subjects and uh so again the young adults are actually you know kids uh too uh so 53 um heart rate variability 53 milliseconds that also declined all the way from until 70 to 79 years where they had a 19 millisecond rm ssd but then note that the 80 to 99 year olds actually had an increase to 30. So the authors of this paper propose the idea that having a higher heart rate variability than your age group may be a promoter of longevity so these data are in relatively small studies though 260 and 344 subjects respectively what about in bigger studies so in a study of 8 million subjects we can see that data here but first i want to note that these data are based on fitbit users so we may have a healthy user bias in that the data that i just showed you with the smaller sample sizes these are people from the general population um and you know fitbit users are more likely to care about their health because they're buying a fitbit so they may be starting or have a higher level of fitness than the general population so along those lines we can see that the the heart rate variability of the the fitbit users in this study at a young age 20 to 25 years old had uh rmssd so heart rate variability values uh you know 65 into the 70s whereas the other studies had you know 53 was the high so there may be a little bit of a healthy user bias in this cohort nonetheless we can see that heart rate variability uh declines uh through aging you know so so from values uh you know around 70 and youth all the way to around 40 in in 60 year olds so um the low heart rate variability the importance of that is also illustrated by the findings that it's associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death scd and all-cause mortality risk acm so first uh this is a plot for the relative risk for sudden cardiac death in a a group of 12 and a half thousand people and what we can see is that for people that had that had heart rate variability uh variability uh scores rms ssds of less than 18 milliseconds they had an increased risk for sudden cardiac death relative to people who had higher than 29 milliseconds so lower heart rate variability uh potentially bad for sudden cardiac death and then along those lines uh there was an increased all-cause mortality risk that had uh rm ssds of less than eight milliseconds so long story short very low heart rate variable variability uh potentially bad for all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death now these are values very low values that you'd expect to see in someone who's very old if you look at the fitbit data you know the average value was around 35-40 so but it's also pop possible you know with an unfit sedentary life lifestyle to have very low heart rate variability so uh having higher values for rmssd as the measure of heart rate variability may be important for cardiovascular and and and health in general uh so and just to also illustrate so i noted that uh resting heart rate declines with aging and so does heart rate variability so if you have a low rhr and a low hrv that's worse cardiovascular cv fitness so what's my data how you know we started on this path to determine if um you know my resting heart rate maybe peaked and now is on the towards the end of life trend and we're using heart rate variability to try to elucidate more of the picture so what's my data so here's my data for the past 23 months uh and my fitness tracker uses uh the rms as the uh metric for heart rate variability so we can see uh you know slowly uh increase in and with a you know massive spike in the winter of uh 2019 into 2020 but an increase over time and when i look at the average my average value in 2018 so august through december my when i started off my heart rate variability was 47.3 the full year average 365 days for 2019 was higher 56.2 and then for the first six months of 2020 i've been able to get it even higher at 61. And one way i'm doing that is by uh you know use better better integrating rest not over training uh monitoring the intensity and duration of my workouts and all that collectively over the past few years that i guess i've been doing a good job based on my heart rate variability data so just to bring back the aging data to illustrate um the importance of my my data and how it fits into the literature so i started tracking when i was 45 years old and just based on the fitbit users in this study the average heart rate variability the rmssd was around 38 you know 40 somewhere in that ballpark so already even though my training and rest periods and all that stuff was uh sub-optimal at the time compared to where i'm now i was still a little bit better than the average fitbit user uh with you know my values around 47. Now looking at my 2019 data and how it fits on this curve we can see that compared to the average fitbit user my heart rate variability age is so is equivalent to that of a 30 year old which is pretty good if you ask me uh and then but in 2020 i've also improved so um you know one can one could argue that you know relative to my chronological age i've got the heart rate variability of someone that's closer to 26 years old rather than 45 years old and i'd argue that may be one of the reasons why i have a relatively young biological age as indicated by levine's phenotypic age calculator uh video i have a video on that if you're interested just check out my videos so uh collectively my eight my reduced heart rate uh resting heart rate over time but i have a reduced rhr over time but an increased heart rate variability so i'd argue that i'm on the right track so the idea that i hit the peak for resting heart rate and now i'm on the slow age related decline towards death based on my heart rate variability data in combination with the resting heart rate data i'd argue that that's not the case so you can find me lots of places online if you're interested reach out have a great day
