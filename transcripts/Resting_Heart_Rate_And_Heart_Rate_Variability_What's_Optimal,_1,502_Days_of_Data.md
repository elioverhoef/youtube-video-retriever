## Transcript

If we track and optimize biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging be slowed if so what should we track so here we can see biomarkers representative of many different organ systems and more specifically many of these biomarkers are included in the blood-based biological age clocks phenowage and or aging.ai and they include biomarkers of immune function liver function metabolic function glucose lipid panel etc and kidney function but other biomarkers are not included including biomarkers of muscle bone and body composition or related to muscle bone and body composition lung function brain function and or health and cardiovascular metrics so with that in mind the focus of this video will be what's optimal for the cardiovascular fitness metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability so let's start off with the resting heart rate rhr and seeing how it changes during aging so this is whoop data whoop is what i wear i'm not sponsored by them that's i've worn them since 2018 there are many different devices that can provide this information so here we're looking at the average resting heart rate over the 20 to 50 age age range and this is data for women in red and men in blue and we can see that resting heart rate increases for both men and women up to 50 years of age what about older than 50 years so for that we've got to go to fitbit data and here again we're looking at the average resting heart rate but now we can see that the age range is wider from 20 to 85 years old and in degree agreement with the whoop data we can see that wrestling heart rate does indeed increase up until around 50 years of age for women in green and men in blue but after that resting heart rate declines during aging from about 50 to 85 years old so we can see that resting heart rate increases then it decreases during aging now note that relatively low resting heart rates are found both in youth and in older age so is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging how can we answer that question so for that heart rate variability hrv provides more context so what is the hrv so the definition of it is it's the variability for the time in between heartbeats so for example for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute the assumption is that the heart beats exactly once per second but that's not necessarily true so here we're looking at three consecutive heartbeats and we can see that the time in between those heartbeats is not exactly the same 859 milliseconds 793 and 726 milliseconds for those three the intervals for those three intervals for each heartbeat there so the time in between heartbeats is the variability that's calculated as heart rate variability and more specifically wu provides the rmssd that's the root mean squared of successive differences so that's the data that i'm going to present as as it directly applies to what i'm wearing or what i'm wearing or the gen the data that i'm getting from from woo so let's have a look at how heart rate variability changes during aging and we can see that here again this is the rmssd this is the version of heart rate variability provided by whoop and note that all heart rate variability measurements are not the same so it's an important distinction to know if it's the rm ssd or other heart rate variability measures and this data is from the 20 to 60 year age range and this is a study of more than 8.2 million people so this isn't whoop data and note that we've got two different curves here we've got the solid lines and the dashed lines with the data for women in red men in blue and note that the data the solid lines is heart rate variability data obtained early in the morning at six in the morning and the dashed lines is at six o'clock at night so we can see that heart rate variability is higher in the morning when compared with nighttime measurements now for me woot provides the data in the morning so while i'm asleep during the last sleep cycle so that's the data that i'm going to focus on going forward so with that we can see that heart rate variability declines during aging as shown there with value of about 75 median values of about 75 and 20 year olds and values of about half of that around 35 to 40 in 60 year olds so what about older than 60 going beyond this age range so there there are very few studies that have looked into this in older adults at least very large studies that have looked at this here's one of them that's highlighted and when looking at from youth up until 79 years old we can see that heart rate variability does indeed decline during aging starting from values of 53 milliseconds down to 19 milliseconds but then something interesting happens at least in this study for the 20 80 to 99 year olds and we can see that the heart rate variability is higher than expected based on the age-related decline with a with an rm ssd of 30 milliseconds i mean this would be something you'd expect to see it's for someone in their late 30s so having a higher this suggests that a higher heart rate variability than expected based on chronological age may be a marker of longevity and in support of that let's take a look at data for uh older than 99 years old so data in centenarians so again this is the rmssd so heart rate variability and the centenarians in the study again it's a small study so we can't make definitive conclusions we need to see more data but for the 17 centenaries in the study that had an average age of 102 years they had a median heart rate variability of 36 milliseconds now that was significantly higher than the 84 year olds that had a median heart rate variability of 24 milliseconds but note that the centenarians didn't have higher heart rate variabilities than very young adults 21 year olds that had a heart rate variability of about 58 milliseconds so from that we can see from these two studies that suggests that having a higher heart rate variability than expected based on chronological age may be a marker of longevity but we'll need to see more studies to see if that will be true or not so to address our question earlier is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging we can we can now uh answer that question so at younger ages we see relatively lower resting heart rates but relatively higher heart rate variabilities and conversely at older ages going even beyond 60 years old we we can expect to see lower resting heart rates but also relatively low heart rate variability now i've tracked both of these metrics since august of 2018 and i now have more than 1500 days of data so let's take a look at that data now based on the population based averages that i've presented on this slide we'd expect to see an increasing resting heart rate and a declining heart rate variability over that four year period so let's see if that's true so let's start off with data for resting heart rate and this is individual days so this is 1500 more than 1500 days of data each each thought is a single day of data so when i first started tracking in 2018 my resting heart rate was about 50 51 beats per minute which was then reduced and this is the year average was then reduced in 2019 to about 49 beats per minute further reduced in 2020 to 48.1 further reduced in 2020 uh sorry 2020 for the reducing 2021 to 47 around 47 beats per minute and my current average in 2022 is 44.9 beats per minute now besides just looking at averages year to year averages we can calculate whether a year-to-year changes may be significantly different using a two sample t-test so when doing that we can see that each of these years 2019-2020 etc when compared to 2018 are significantly lower based on the p-value with a p-value less than 0.05 being statistically significant and then we can also compare year-over-year changes not just 2019 versus 2018. So when doing that each each of the years from 2020 to 2022 is significantly better than the preceding year so a significantly reduced year over year yoy resting heart rate since 2018. So from that we can see that i've consistently reduced my resting heart rate over the past four years so is that good or bad and the reason that i asked that question is because we know that a relatively low resting heart rate can be found in youth but also in advanced age as shown there so note that i i've resisted at the very least i've resisted the age-related increase for resting heart rate based on this data we'd expect to see an increasing resting heart rate over the last four years but that's not the case i've actually reversed that so to address that question is is this good or bad the the constantly consistently declining resting heart rate for more context let's have a look at heart rate variability data since 2018 and that's what we can see here so uh when i first started tracking in 2018 my average heart rate variability was 40 set around 47 in 2019 i increased it to 56 and using a two sample t-test that was a significant increase so i significantly improved heart rate variability 2019 versus 2018 in 2020 57.8 milliseconds for for an average for the year and then when compared to 2018 still significantly higher but uh just outside of statistical significance for being a year-over-year improvement so from that we can conclude that 2019 data was not different from 2020 for heart rate variability although it was better than when i started in 2018 but then in 2021 i regressed uh you can see my average heart rate variability was 59 51.9 milliseconds for the full year uh daily average and this is better than 2018 but significantly worse than 2020 as shown there so a major goal of 2022 was to get my heart rate variability back up and we can see that thus far in in 2022 my average heart rate variability is 59.4 milliseconds which is better than when i started in 2018 based on a two-sample t-test and better year over year when compared with 2021. So from that we can see that i've increased my heart rate variability over the past four years with that hiccup in 2021 now let's ha let's put these data into context how did these data compare with age-related changes for heart rate variability so we can the the expected median heart rate variability based on my chronological age uh which i'll be 50 in january would be 35.1 milliseconds based on how it changes during aging now to put my 2022 data into context at worst 59 milliseconds is just above the high end of the heart rate variability range for my chronological age but at best this is this is the median heart rate variability that will be found for someone that's about 22 years younger so whether the truth is just good for my chronological age or a value that you would expect to see in someone much younger the the truth is probably somewhere in the middle all right so now we can address that question again is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so in my case having a relatively high heart rate variability plus a low resting heart rate more specifically 59 for heart rate variability 40 45 for resting heart rate in 2022 that suggests cardiovascular youth in contrast for my chronological age a lower heart rate variability but a higher resting heart rate more specifically expected data would be 35 for hrv 57 based on chronological age so we can see that 59 45 is better than 35 57 higher heart rate variability lower resting heart rate suggestive of cv youth cardiovascular youth all right so what's contributing to these improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability how am i doing it so a big factor may involve body weight so this is my average monthly body weight from august of 2018 through september of 2022 so over the same period that i've been tracking these cardiovascular fitness metrics and we can see that oh before saying uh jumping into the data note that i record my body weight every morning after you know pee and poop and fasted so when i first started we can see i was heavier than where i am now so around around 159 159 pounds where currently now i'm about 151 152. So what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate so here we're looking at my average monthly resting heart rate over that same time period and the two curves look interestingly uh similar where they could even potentially overlap and more specifically when we look at the periods where my body weight was reduced over time we can see that our heart resting heart rate also declined over the over that same time period conversely when my body weight went up for a given given periods of time resting heart rate increased so that then raises the question is body weight significantly correlated with resting heart rate so for that let's look at individual data points for daily resting heart rate versus body weight in order to calculate the correlation between the two and we can see that that correlation is positive meaning as as body weight increases resting heart rate uh increases too or as body weight increases that's significantly correlated based on that p-value there with a higher resting heart rate conversely as body weight approaches 150 pounds that's significantly correlated with uh resting heart rate approaching 45 beats per minute and because my most recent body weights or average monthly body weights are approaching 150 that shouldn't be a surprise then why my resting heart rate is around 45 beats per minute all right so what about heart rate variability what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability so the this plot for average monthly heart rate variability is shown there isn't as clear uh clear-cut as the data for resting heart rate where you can't overlap it with with the uh body weight trace but we do see some uh apparent trends so as body weight has declined as shown there by the green arrows we can see increases for heart rate variability and conversely uh as body weight has increased we can also see that my heart rate variability has decreased during those periods now it's not as clear-cut though so what about this the correlation are they significantly correlated so we can see that data here daily heart rate variability versus body weight over the past four plus years and again we see a significant negative correlation uh which means that as body weight increases that's significantly correlated with uh reduced heart rate variability and conversely as body weight approaches 150 pounds we can see that my heart rate variability approaches 60 milliseconds which is pretty close to where i am currently for 2022. So to answer the question what's the relationship for body weight with heart rate variability and resting heart rate at least for me it may be different for others resting heart rate and heart rate variability approach youthful values as body weight decreases now note that this may not be the only factor that's impacting my data daily physical activity also and i should mention obviously impacts cardiovascular fitness metrics so let's take a look at that data so as a measure measure of daily physical activity i track the average daily heart rate which is provided by my fitness tracker so the uh and that's and i mentioned i use that as an index the adhr as an index of daily physical activity and why that's important is because if you walk a thousand step steps on flat ground uh that'll that'll result in a lower heart rate when compared with walking a thousand steps up a hill so when compared with tracking steps tracking heart rate may be a more informative measure of of the effort involved in in your steps or the effort involved overall effort involved in your daily physical activity but note that a higher average daily heart rate isn't just indicative of physical activity i've had days where i wasn't very physically active but had some you know emotional stress going on unfortunately those days are rare but i've seen heart rates on those heart rates on those days that are can even surpass my days that include workouts so obviously i try to minimize as much non-workout stress as possible to to limit that variable all right so what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with next day resting heart rate then we can see that here so this is data for from march of 2020 through september of 2022 so i have far less data only about 900 days unfortunately i didn't have the idea to track the average daily heart rate until about 900 days ago but i wish i tracked it earlier so i'd have a lot more data nonetheless we can see that there's a positive a significant positive correlation between how active that i was and my next day resting heart rate so that suggests that too much daily activity and too often will be bad for the resting heart rate all right so what about heart rate variability how does physical activity affect next day heart rate variability so we can see that here and we can see that again a significant negative correlation which suggests that the higher my average daily heart rate the lower my next day heart rate variability which again too suggests too much daily activity and too often would be bad for heart rate variability so with that in mind finding the balance between active and rest days will be important for optimizing resting heart rate and heart rate variability now i can't say how that would work for others i think that's an individual thing you'd have to determine you know after a workout day how many days you may need to recover based on tracking um heart rate variability resting heart rate and the average daily heart rate but to illustrate in my day data what that looks like so we can see that my on my active days that include a workout my usual workout my average daily heart rate is 59 beats per minute so starting from the middle with that 59 we can then see over the next three days i purposely titrated activity downward so that it was lower than 59 beats per minute allowing my cardiovascular system to recover and potentially enabling uh you know maximal improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability and then you can see by the 59 spike at the end then i then had another workout so that's a four day cycle work out and then three relatively lower intensity days and then work out again but i also have a three day cycle as you can see on the left side of the graph there was a 59 and that was a workout day too and then i titrated activity downward over the next two days after then i had another workout on day three so three day cycle for exercise followed by a four day cycle in this representative image and that's basically the approach that i've sucked to for the last few weeks i try to stick to a three-day cycle but sometimes you know work-life balance gets in the way all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon uh before you go we've got some discount links that you may be
