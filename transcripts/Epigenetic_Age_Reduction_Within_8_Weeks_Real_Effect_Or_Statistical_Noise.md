# Epigenetic Age Reduction Within 8 Weeks: Real Effect Or Statistical Noise?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Can epigenetic age be reduced within an eight-week study that's what this study which was published a few months ago sought to figure out so first uh how many what was the study cohort how many participants and how old were they so this was a relatively small study uh that included 38 men unfortunately women were not included so whether these uh effects apply to women or only men are unknown and the subjects had an average age of 59 years so also whether these results are general generalizable to younger subjects or older subjects also on unknown uh now note that this is a potential reversal of epigenetic age using a diet and lifestyle intervention so what was recommended and they recommended a lot of things so it's important to go through each of them to see what they were trying to do and how they were trying to do it and then to look at uh what they actually found in terms of epigenetic age so this was their dietary prescription and this was their recommended guidance per day so daily intake and they recommended a decent amount of vegetables as you can see two cups per day of dark leafy greens including kale swiss chard collard spinach etc two cups of crushes cruciferous vegetables so broccoli cabbage cauliflower and all of the rest of the cruciferous vegetable family and then three additional cups per day of colorful vegetables but not starchy vegetables like white potatoes or corn one to two medium beats per day and then they also included some seeds or recommended seed intake so cumulatively the seeds is about this is about 60 grams per day or about 400 calories of pumpkin and sunflower seeds and then this was not a vegan or vegetarian diet as they recommended eight ounces of animal protein per day including grass-fed uh pastured organic and hormone and antibiotic-free meat and then they recommended two servings per day of low glycemic fruit cherries apples pears etc but that wasn't all for the dietary recommendations they also recommended a one plus serving per day of what they called were methylation adaptogens so foods or drinks that have been shown to affect methylation dna methylation and these uh recommendations included half a cup per day of berries rosemary turmeric cloves of garlic two cups per diet of green tea which would count as one serving per day or three cups of oolong tea so they only recommended one plus serving so it would be one uh food or drink item from this list that would be an actual intake potentially all right and then in terms of the diet going further they also off offered guidance per week so weekly guidance uh and they uh recommended three servings of liver with one serving serving being three ounces of liver uh of liver so about nine ounces of liver was recommended per week and then five to ten eggs per week but they actually their prescription their recommendations actually went way beyond this too so let's go a little bit further so their general guidance was to uh consume organic foods over conventional pesticide laid in foods and to stay hydrated so to drink enough water and then they recommended a you know some version of time restricted feeding so not eating between 7 p.m and 7 a.m and then they recommended uh including quote-unquote healthy oils and they said to balance types of fat and if you notice their list here coconut olive flaxseed and pumpkin seed oil these are fats representative of different uh types of fatty acids for example coconut is almost exclusively saturated fatty acids olive is uh mostly monounsaturated fatty acids flaxseed is mostly omega-3 polyunsaturated and pumpkin seed oil is mostly omega-6 polyunsaturated and then they recommended avoiding sugar and candy and then dairy grains also dairy grains and legumes so one could argue this is some version of a modified paleo diet including meat vegetables some fruit and some seeds but not obviously any sugar candy dairy grains or legumes and and then they also recommended to minimize plastic food containers or use of that now the the recommendations didn't stop there uh they also uh uh provided a study by study participants in the treatment group with a supplement that was a combination of dried vegetables fruit seeds herbs and other stuff which they consider to be prebiotics which encouraged the growth of conical beneficial bacteria in the intestine and then they also supplemented with uh probiotics including uh lactobacillus plantarum and the reason they included this uh bacterium is because it's been shown to increase folate synthesis uh and because folate's involved in methylation cycle one could argue that having a higher folate intake could result in a younger epigenetic age they also recommended uh exercise and obviously these aren't anything outrageous but they recommended 30 minutes per day five days per week which are pretty close to the standard recommendations and then they also offered sleep prescription and stress management prescriptions including uh getting an average of seven hours of sleep per night and uh performing breathing exercises and their rationale for this was if you're was it was that if you were sleep deprived or you have chronic stress that this could result in an older epigenetic age so by getting enough stress sleep and reducing stress that they could potentially reduce their uh epigenetic age within the study timeline now as you can see they recommended a lot of diet and lifestyle changes so we should expect to see a very large decrease or at least that was the hope for epigenetic age so what did they find so here are the main study results and first it's important to note that we're looking on the y-axis at epigenetic age for the change versus baseline now an interesting question arises then which epigenetic clock was used to quantify epigenetic age that's important because if you're not using a good metric to study this then how reliable are your results so which clock did they use so it's important to note that all epigenetic clocks are not the same for their correlation with chronological age so in this study and i've reviewed this study in an earlier video if you're interested in learning about the results from that study you can click on the video in the right corner for more details about the uh this compare comparative study of 11 epigenetic clocks so uh this is the correlation for each of these 11 epigenetic clocks with a multitude of different cell types and uh blood and that is in the right corner you know including cells from the breast cheek cerebellum so brain colon cord blood etc in other words which epigenetic clock was uh the best for uh the compositive the compositive uh the full accumulate uh the full amount of these different cell types which epigenetic test was the best for their correlation with chronological age across all of the cell types so uh what we can see by looking at the correlation so cor and the p-value so the the two that had the strongest correlation and in fact a correlation as close to one or negative one is as good as it gets so in this case we're looking for as close to one but not negative one we want uh you know older epigenetic age to be associated with older chronological ages and vice versa so in this case we can see the two strongest correlations 0.94 and 0.85 as i've rectangled are horvath steve horvath's epigenetic clock you can see if you take a look at the correlations in the p-values for the other nine epigenetic locks they are nowhere near as close or not as close as horvath's for uh their correlation with chronological age so uh this isn't the only study that's shown this uh steve horvath's epigenetic clock is consistently the best for its correlation with chronological age so okay that's a good sign they use the horvath epigenetic clock for their for their analysis now well now that we know that what did they find so first when looking at the difference from baseline to the end of the study eight weeks later the controls had a 1.27 older epigenetic age but this wasn't a statistically significant difference from baseline and you can see based on the p-value 0.15 p-value is greater than 0.05 are not statistically significant so what about the treatment group the one that uh was exposed to this large diet plus lifestyle intervention or at least recommended to have a large diet plus lifestyle intervention and and we can see the treatment group so comparing again baseline versus eight weeks later uh experienced a 1.96 year younger epigenetic age when compared with baseline but note that the p value is just outside of the 0.05 cutoff 0.66 so it's important to note that you know the change that the treatment group saw was close to statistical significance but not statistically significant so uh how was uh statistical significance uh uh uh obtained and that was when uh obtained when comparing between group data so when uh comparing the changes for the treatment group versus the changes with controls for both groups combined we can see that now overall there was a 3.2 uh 3.23 year younger epigenetic age for the treatment group when compared with controls and now the p-value is statistically significant so uh that's oh that's a good that it shows that there was a treatment effect between group treatment effect but let's look a little bit deeper at this data so it's important to note that epigenetic age was improved for only 44 of the treatment group so let's have a look at that data so here we can see on the x-axis dna mh so epigenetic age measured at the beginning of the study so before any potential interventions and again this is only the data for the treatment group versus on the y-axis the epigenetic age measured at the end of the study so first what we can see is that there was a younger epigenetic age at the end of the study when compared with the beginning of the study for only eight of the 18 subjects in the treatment group as indicated by the black arrows however there was an unchanged uh epigenetic age dnam age at the end of the study when compared with the beginning for exactly half of the studies in that group and actually one of the 18 subjects experienced an older epigenetic age in the treatment group when compared with the beginning of the study so it's important to note that there was no change or worse that one subject epigenetic age for more than half of the participants in the in the in the treatment group so this was promoted as a diet and lifestyle intervention and in fact a big a massive diet in lifestyle intervention but what did they actually eat how much or how often did they actually exercise take the supplement practice the breathing exercises and all of the other stuff that was on the list so i raised that issue because in the studies and inclusion criteria so these are the criteria that are required to be agreed upon by the study participants in order for them to be included into the study we can see that one of those inclusion criteria was being willing to track food intake sleep stress management techniques and exercise daily so that data should exist however it wasn't published so it's impossible to say if any parts of this intervention were actually different from baseline and moreover because that data wasn't reported in the study it's unclear if there was actually a difference for any of that the diet plus lifestyle intervention from baseline so it's unclear how much the intervention actually affected epigenetic age so with that in mind was that about two-year difference in epigenetic age reduction and only in the treatment group a real effect that was caused by this intervention or statistical noise so uh that's all for that for that study i just wanted to throw in a quick ad that i'm now on patreon so uh for those who want to learn more about my biohacking pursuits even though i didn't show it in this video but upcoming videos i'm gonna get back to that uh i'm gonna post exclusive uh information that i don't post anywhere else on none of my social media sites including my daily data for rest uh resting heart rate heart rate variability and sleep stages and then my daily intake for food and macro micronutrients so you can follow along with how my daily progress goes for both of those variables and then early sneak peeks and spoilers for new videos yesterday i posted some of the slides from this video right here and a lot more so if you're interested in that check it out and uh again once again uh that's all for now uh if you made it to the end thanks for watching and you can find me a lot of places online have a great day
