# 65 - 100% Lifespan Extension In Drosophila: A Conversation With Dr. Michael Rose (Part I)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In a study that was published more than 20 years ago lifespan was extended from 65 to more than 100 in fruit flies otherwise known as drosophila so before getting into how they did that let's take a look at the lifespan data so on the top we're looking at the percent survival for male flies and on the bottom for female flies and when looking at average survival uh the point where half of the colony is alive and half is dead we can see that average survival for the male flies was about 38 days whereas for female flies it's in the ballpark somewhere around 35 days but then notice the significant uh extension in average lifespan uh so the shift in the survival curve is to the right for both the male and the female flies so the lifespan average lifespan in the male flies was increased by about 68 percent and similarly by about 65 percent in the female flies but also interestingly note the increase in maximal lifespan for both the male and female flies for the male flies there was an approximate doubling of maximal lifespan from somewhere around 60 days to more than about 130 days and although the magnitude of the lifespan extending effect wasn't as great in the female flies as in the male flies nonetheless the female flies also had about a 65 percent increase in maximal lifespan so how was lifespan extended did they use calorie restriction rapamycin nicotinamide riboside nr or something else so what they used is uh an experimental evolutionary approach so what does that entail so here we're looking at the force of natural selection on survival on the y-axis plotted against biological age on the x-axis and what we can see is that during childhood the force of natural selection on survival is very strong such that survival is about 100 so basically no mortality rate but once we hit the first age of reproduction we can see that the force of natural selection on survival starts to fall all the way up until the last age of reproduction and at some point in the near future after that death so with this in mind if you delay reproduction as they did in this study for both the male and the female mice uh until the last possible point in these curves you can extend lifespan and that's exactly what they saw so uh and by doing this for many generations and actually for thousands of generations in the fruit flies that led to this significant lifespan extension now the lab that was responsible for this uh these studies is of dr michael rose who is a distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the university of california irvine and he's also the director of near the network for experimental research on evolution i recently had the honor of having a conversation with him and asking about asking him about these findings and how we can potentially translate them uh translate them into human longevity and a whole lot more so this is the first part of that conversation so let's get into the conversation enjoy i want to jump right in and uh i think i think a lot a lot more people in the aging space know about you uh you know man it wasn't like that 10 years ago which is crazy i'm you know i knew about you but most people didn't still so uh i think it's important that we uh start from uh your lab being one of the few if the only that's extended lifespan without using drugs or you know any pharmaceuticals you can think of or calorie restriction so i think i think a good place to start would be the experimental evolution approach explaining that and then going into the magnitude of the lifespan extension that you saw as a result okay well thank you for this opportunity mike uh and it's it's great to be interacting with you like this cool um i've been admired your stuff for some time um so in 1977 at the university of sussex library i was reading an article by a uh a very early uh gerontology person called a belgian who actually had worked in the lab of theodosius bajansky but watia was a neolimarkian and he was looking for neolamarkin effects on lifespan and he did a experiment where he bred flies exclusively from older adults he did this in two different drosophila species sub obscure and pseudo-obscura and in both cases he got an increase in lifespan which he interpreted in terms of a lancing effect or an inverse lansing effect because when lansing did it fly his staff he died out for completely different reasons um i read the article and i thought oh he modified the first stage of reproduction which according to hamilton's forces of natural selection means that given enough time these populations should involve delayed aging and uh which which was not watio's interpretation of his own experiment whatsoever so i thought well why don't i do a cleaner version of this experiment using nicely of red fruit flies which i did during my doctorate at sussex in the 1970s and it worked just as well for me in my one population pilot experiment as it had for water and i wrote up that experiment and a few others that i've been doing during my doctorate i sent them off to an obscure journal called nature which uh published the article in 1980 it's called a test of evolutionary theories of senescence and i was so enamored with this very simple experimental evolution project where you just change the early stage at which you allow one organism to reproduce and then you take advantage of evolutionary genetic theory the most hardcore theory in our biology um and it does the work for you only uh the second time i did the experiment started in 1980 i did it with five populations uh with the late reproduction and five control populations and off we went uh starting in february of 1980 and those populations still exist they i sold them to an anti-aging company um called matheus of flies which still owns them [music] and i still work with them intermittently as a consultant to to various companies that are interested in working with those um since then in my lab uh university of uh california and irvine we have taken lifespan up using experimental pollution and taking it down using experimental machinery back up again um we have also modified lifespan using diet using drugs as have other people so i have been manipulating aging since 1977 as well as studying this underlying genetics genomics and transcriptomics in partnership with many other people um ever since the 1970s and all of the work suggests that aging is not [music] an uncontrollable process of molecular damage it is instead the tuning of adaptation of the two age which is easily done by natural selection utd through its dereliction of doing that job engenders aging and the genomic means by which natural selection tunes aging involves hundreds of sites in the gm not one not two not seven hundreds as i said in dozens of interviews over the last decade um and that in turn tunes hundreds of transcript levels both qualitatively and quantitatively and it in turn tunes hundreds of metabolites of all different kinds and then it retunes all the organ systems and the flies the hard thing is to find something that is not connected to aging uh almost everything is connected to ancient even a very simple organism like a fruit fly and i would say very confidently by the extrapolation i think you means also so so you started from the same founder group of flies and then you separated them into the long live versus a short short live or yeah isn't is that's basically the well the the the material protocol is to tune the life cycle if you tune the life cycle so that there's a long period of time between when an egg becomes or is given a delt that is produced by the egg is given the opportunity to produce the longer that life cycle is the greater the lifespan that that population will evolve and it does so at considerable speed and then if you then reverse the procedure and take long life cycles wise and getting shorter life cycles they will rapidly evolve shorter life spans um and so going up going down going up going down that's something i've now been doing for 44 years yeah so that so that approach is clearly showing that you can use evolution to extend lifespan and not extend it by a little bit by 10 or 15 or 20 you know by by two times three times five times yeah so the question is how many generations did it take before you saw um say a doubling of lifespan in drosophila the doubling of lifespan took about 80 generations 80 generations so 25 years if we're going to extrapolate that into human years right 25 years per generation so we're looking at uh what 2000 years 80 times 25 right so so uh together with my very good colleague larry muller we published a paper in around 1990 somewhere between 89 and 91 about 30 years ago on how long it would take if you wanted to use this approach with human lifespan and it's not worth doing uh so actually since 84 at the instigation at first to journalists and then by more and more people that i've met over the last uh 37 years i've i've been working coming up with faster and faster ways of doing this that don't involve experimental evolution so okay can you can you tell us more about that or is that uh sure so so we published an article in um well what was it uh the early two let me try to get the year circa 2010 um in a book called the future of aging he was edited by greg faye and steve cools and a couple of other people where um we outlined uh one idea that a company called genesee was founded on and that company still exists [music] and [music] that was basically a layered supplementation approach uh very michaelis garden i might say uh except instead of experimenting on mike westgarden himself the idea was to experiment with fruit flies and see what we could get to work there and uh look at the omics of how it was done in fruit flies and then use an omic bridge to to humans because so much of our genomes are transcriptomes and the timelines overlap um so it would have been an omic uh guided uh bridging to human intervention so that was a technology i was very enamored with 15 years ago when that company was founded then i found another company with a man called larry cabral about six years ago it's called lyceum and that was based on another strategy and i don't know if the company has mostly seen student business but the website might still be up and uh so i've gone through a whole succession of technological ideas for how to intervene in the human aging process that do not involve experimental evolution and i'm still interested in that project so wouldn't so uh i guess the idea would be to come up with a cocktail of as many different or you know supplements drugs etc as possible to kind of replicate the uh omic multi-omic uh signature that you see in the extended lifespan dramatically extended lifespan in the food flies but i'm guessing that that's going to fall short because i mean you're you know as you mentioned you're dealing with hundreds of genes and then hundreds of trans transcriptomic sites and then you know maybe more than that in terms of metabolites so how close were you able to get using the multi uh multi-supplement you know drug based approach in terms of extending lifespan in flies um so janessa made a good start in that project and that research actually led to a supplement which is available right now um it's marketed by a company called chennaire [music] and [music] i can't remember the name of the product but you can look up the company name on amazon um i was not directly involved in developing that product or testing it but it used some of my ideas um [music] and and i guess i think they called it rebuilder or something like that and right now it's being marketed as a cognitive health product since i left gymnastics in 2010 um [music] over the last 11 years i've been very interested in using ai more precisely machine learning to master the intricacies of going from fruit fly genomes to human genomes of going from ohmic effects to clinical efficacy in humans um we are now engaged in a series of publications which started in um 2017 with a massive genomics paper and uh then in 2018 we published our ai methodology which is called plan flam well we didn't develop the machine learning tool in that article first author is is more in e-l-r ld more than last author that presents some of the machine learning we use then in 2019 we publish a transcriptomics paper we are working on metabolomic stuff um i haven't seen the manuscript yet um so uh you know in parallel with my aging career uh i've just generally worked on [music] quantitative genetics of adaptation um and and aging is just in a sense an aspect of adaptation um and you know right from my earliest work on this stuff in the late 70s it was quite apparent that the genetic foundations of adaptation and aging so one of the things i've worked on very hard over the last 41 years is strategies for unpacking the complexity and making our way through complexity both from the standpoint of scientific inference and from the standpoint of technological intervention um so uh as some of your listeners or viewers may already know i did a website called 55 theses t-h-e-s-e-s um model after martin luther 95 theses uh but shorter and earlier um where i try to outline the insights that i had as of 10 years ago but over the last 10 years we've made a lot of additional progress um which we're trying to publish i mean we are publishing it in this sort of sequence of papers that started in 2017. You can find them on my google scholar page michael rvo's and most of our publications since 2017 in spain and there'll be more to come over the next three years um we have one um under review under endless revision of the journal i will not know to protect the guilty um so i think by 2023 um people interested in genomics people interested in adaptation people interested in aging should all have a pretty clear understanding of how complicated the core omics foundations of all this stuff are and also how machine learning can sort through all these things and um thus potentially furthermore how we can bounce back around going from you know fruit flies to humans humans back to fruit flies and make all the connections thanks to homology because it turns out that the metazoan toolkit for adaptation for aging has huge overlaps um you're not when you do experiments with crossover or for that amount of humans you're not just studying drosophila or humans you're studying basic features of aging adaptation and genomics that are in common between medicine the majority of the time the clear majority of the time and you know we're going to be making that quite clear first with christopher then we'll be doing some projects with humanoid data and some machine learning tools i am using
