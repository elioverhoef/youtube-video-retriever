# Oral Microbiome Test #4: Adding Berberine To The Homemade Mouthwash Was A Disaster

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Oral bacteria have been previously linked with alzheimer's disease and we can see that visually represented here including porphyromonas gingivalis or p gingivalis fusobacterium nucleatum or f nucleatum and tannerella forsythia t forsythia now for my fourth oral microbiome test the goal is to reduce salivary levels of these bacteria by adding berberine to a homemade mouthwash so why berberine in an earlier video i showed data that adding berberine to p gingivalis spike saliva reduced levels of porphyromonas and fusobacterium and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got relative abundance of salivary bacteria and then to a control saliva sample pj devalis was added and there we can see that there was an expansion of porphyromonas where pigeon devalis is found and also fusobacterium now berberine was added also added to pidge and devalis treated saliva at three different doses low medium and high 15 30 and 60 micrograms of bc berberine chloride per milliliter and in the presence of berberine we can see that poor firemonas was almost instantly reduced you can see that the green bars are now very small and also fusobacterium although it wasn't reduced at the lowest dose of berberine we can see that at medium and higher doses for berberine in the spiked saliva sample with peach and developes we can see that fusobacterium also went down so with that in mind did it work did having berberine in my homemade mouthwash reduce levels of these oral bacteria that have been linked with alzheimer's disease so to address that i sent saliva samples to bristle and if you're interested in measuring your own salivary microbiome and quantifying that there'll be a discount link in the video's description so full disclosure for oral microbiome test number four adding berberine to the mouthwash was a disaster so let's take a look at why that's the case so here we can see levels of those three bacteria that have been linked with alzheimer's disease and then my levels for the first three tests yielding a three test average of two percent of all bacteria in other words these three bacteria for these three bacteria they their sum was two percent of all of my salivary bacteria now for test number four the good news is that pigeon devalis did go back to zero but i've also had for test number two no or zero levels of pigeon develop so whether that was because berberine or not i'm not sure but the story for fusobacterium nucleatum and tannery forsythia is not so simple so there we can see a dramatic expansion of both those bacteria way above levels that i've had for the first three tests such that this there are some just for those two bacteria was 17.2 percent of all bacteria in other words an 8.8.6 fold increase for fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia with berberine in the homemade mouthwash relative to my three test average of two percent so then the question is why was it just too much berberine in the homemade mouthwash now note that for the in vitro study that i just showed the highest dose used 60 micrograms per milliliter of berberine as the highest dose now my scale the lower limit is 100 milligrams and in one liter of water that equals 100 milligrams of berberine per mil so that's higher than the highest dose used in that in vitro study so it's possible that i overshot the berberine concentration nonetheless i took berberine out from the mouthwash so we won't we won't be seeing that in my oral microbiome test anytime soon so even with daily tooth brushing flossing which i've been doing for years and the homemade mouthwash which i covered that constantly it's concentration in an earlier video my salivary microbiome needs improvement especially with regards to these three bacteria so how will i reduce levels of oral bacteria that have been linked with alzheimer's disease now i don't yet have data without the mouthwash so after four tests that mouthwash which as i mentioned in an earlier video include included xylitol sodium bicarbonate and peppermint oil so i don't know if my salivary microbiome is improved without it in other words i don't have a control with no mouthwash for any of the first four tests so i could just use water for a mouthwash for some period of time but would that be too boring for test number five now note that salivary bacteria can originate from below the gum line and with that in mind i've been flossing daily for years so that i have levels of bacteria that have been linked with alzheimer's disease still in my oral microbiome it suggests that daily flossing at least with string floss may not be ideal for dislodging bacteria from these sub-gingival crevices so what might be better so in april uh after a long time of trying to figure out what i was going to do to optimize or try to optimize an oral microbiome i went and bought a water pick and i'm not affiliated or sponsored with this brand this is what i bought so note that salivary bacteria can also originate from the tongue so i also bought bought a tongue scraper nothing fancy just the simple one that you can get anywhere at stores you know that that sell these things so for test number five we'll see if or how the combination of daily tooth brushing tongue scraping and water pick use if that impacts the salivary microbiome so stay tuned for that data in an upcoming video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including at home metabolomics any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing which is a different panel from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all these other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
