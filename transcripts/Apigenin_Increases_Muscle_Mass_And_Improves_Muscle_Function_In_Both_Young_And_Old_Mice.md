Epigenetic increases muscle mass and function let's have a look at that data so first we're looking at a study in very young male mice in this case they were five weeks old which is equivalent to a toddler the four-year-old toddler so they supplemented the mice with uh two different levels of abigenin uh in this case point two percent and point four percent when compared with a normal diet that did not contain epigenin and this was a seven week study and uh it was a low-fat diet so five percent of the total calories came from fat sixteen percent came from protein so uh first we're looking at the weight of the gas uh quadriceps which are muscles located on the front of the thigh we can see that when compared with animals that were not supplemented with epigenin epigenetic supplementation both low and high increased muscle mass so uh when when muscle masses increase it's important to look at the tissue weights uh other than muscle because if body size increases is it a muscle specific effect so in this uh case there was no difference in body weight or the weight of the heart liver or fat depot so interestingly one could one could conclude that apigenin selectively improved muscle mass in this study so what about physical function so one measure of function is uh treadmill running distance so essentially running to exhaustion on a treadmill so uh for mice that were uh not supplemented with epigenin so nor normal diet compared with the two epigenic groups we can see that epigenetic supplementation uh uh resulted in uh longer running distances for the mice so from this we can conclude that epigenetic improves muscle mass and uh treadmill run distance now mouse studies are interesting but what's the human equivalent dose that could potentially replicate these findings in people so the short answer is 1.2 grams so how did we get there let's derive the human equivalent dose so first in just looking at the low dose epigenetic group 0.2 that translates into 0.2 grams of epigenin per 100 grams of food now mice eat about 3 grams of food per day so when you multiply these values you get six milligrams or .006 grams of epigenin were consumed per day now the mice weighed 28 grams at the end of the study so then we can identify a dose uh you know in milligrams of uh epigenetic consumed per kilogram body weight uh by dividing so uh six milli six milligrams divided by 28.028 kilograms equals 0.21 grams of epigenetic consumed per kilogram body weight per day so 210 milligrams of epigenetic per kilogram body weight now uh we then need to use the body size conversion from mice to humans so for that we divide by 12.3 as i've highlighted here on the right so when we divide 0.21 grams of epigenetic per kilogram body weight by 12.3 we get a uh an equivalent dose of 0.017 grams of epigenetic per kilograms of body weight so then taking my body weight for example 71 kilograms we multiply that by the .017 grams of epigenetic per kilogram body weight and we get to the 1.2 grams of epigenin per day as the human equivalent dose for what was used in the mouse study on the previous slide now that's a lot so are there any other studies that have demonstrated an impact for apigenin on muscle so uh in this study epigenin once again positively affected uh muscle cross-sectional area so essentially the size of each individual muscle fiber was increased and improved treadmill running distance but in this case it was young mice that weren't on a low-fat diet it was on a high-fat diet and that's interesting and important because uh it could be that you know a macronutrient composition uh impacts apigee and supplementation so what this data shows is it doesn't matter if you're on a low fat or a high fat diet or at least for mice uh that epigenetic can improve muscle related measures independent of the diet composition so let's look at let's have a look at their these data so what we're looking at on the left is a muscle cross section so it's essentially a two two dimensional representation of uh individual muscle fibers uh for the normal diet on the top the high fat diet in the middle and then high fat diet plus epigenin and in this case they supplemented the mice with 0.1 percent so uh half of the lowest dose of the previous study so when looking at the individual muscle fibers which are the red areas so i've starred them just a couple of them to highlight those are individual muscle fibers and the muscle that they looked at was the gastrocnemius so essentially the calf muscle on the lower leg so when comparing the cross-sectional area in the gastrocnemius on normal on the normal diet high fat diet had a smaller muscle cross-sectional area as indicated by the stars but then when they supplemented the animals with epigenin on the high-fat diet we can see a small but you know a significant increase in uh muscle cross-sectional area so they besides the visual representation of the individual muscle uh uh cross-sectional areas in response to apigenin or not they quantify these data in a chart and that's what we see here so when compared to the cross-sectional areas csa on the normal diet nor we can see that the high fat diet fed mice had a smaller muscle cross-sectional area so smaller individual muscle fibers but then epigenetic supplementation on the high-fat diet resulted in an increased muscle cross-sectional area so individual muscle fiber area is interesting but function may be more relevant so to assess that they ran mice on a treadmill to exhaustion uh and then measured running distance so that was that's that's what we're looking at here on the uh on the right and what we can see is that mice on a high fat diet ran a significantly shorter distance compared to the normal diet which was not a high fat diet i should have mentioned in this case this was a 60 fat diet 20 protein and it was an eight week study in uh 22 week old male mice so once again they didn't use females which is a major limitation because then it's unknown if these data would apply to women since none of the studies looked at uh female mice uh and the uh so these data in 22 week old mice are equivalent to about a 17 year old in in human years all right so treadmill running distance we can see that the high fat diet there's a lower uh they ran a shorter distance but then epigenetic supplementation on the high fat diet they ran a longer distance so uh what's the human equivalent dose based on these data um so using a similar similar calculation before and a little bit bigger mice because on a high fat diet it's an obesogenic diet meaning the animals gain more weight more quickly so the animals weren't 28 grams at the end of the study as in the previous uh slide in this case they were 50 grams at the end of the study so when incorporating that data into the human equivalent dose hed we get 346 milligrams per day for a 71 kilogram person so about a three-fold reduction compared to the data on the previous slide in terms of how much epigenin may impact muscles so we're getting pretty close to a level of epigenetic that potentially can be impacted through diet and or supplementation all right now data in young mice is interesting but what about during aging uh so that's what we're going to see here in this study and in this case uh giving away you know the slide is the slide's data is epigenetic increases muscle mass strength and treadmill running distance and also reduces frailty in old mice so first they compared young and old so what were the ages of those mice so young was uh were six to nine month old animals which is uh um equivalent to people that are in the 20 to 31 year age range and then old were 16 old mice or what they called old with 16 month old mice maximum lifespan in the animal uh the mice that they use is around 36 months so 16 months is closer to middle age than old but besides that you know the definition of their uh uh their definition of old it's a it's approximately middle age and once again they also use data for males they didn't look at these uh epigenetic supplementation in females which is again a major limitation because uh you know having data applied to only one gender and not another you know it's half the population so all right so then what doses of epigenin did they supplement so they gave 25 50 and 100 milligrams per kilogram of apigenin now in the first two slides the epigenin was provided in the food or the drinking water and that can induce variability in how much apigenin is consumed because if mice individual mice consume more or less food they're consuming more or less epigenin and you know similarly if you drink more or less water you're going to have some variability in the epigenome that you consume so in this case they provided the epigenin by a via intragastric administration which is essentially they're injecting it down their throat so not pleasant but that's what they did all right so what was the impact of epigenetic on muscle related measures in old mice so first we're looking at muscle weight divided by body weight and again it's important to divide by body weight because if muscle weight and body size are both increased it may not be a muscle specific effect it's just an overall increase in body size so first in looking at um so again i should mention which muscles did they look at they looked at the tibialis anterior the extensor digitorus longum edl and then the soleus sole and i've i've highlighted in a little cartoon on the right the little picture on the right uh that these are lower uh uh muscles uh these are lower lower leg muscles all right so first during aging there was an age-related decline in the muscle weight to body weight ratio which is well known i mean that's been documented in very many many studies so each of these muscles saw an age-related decline in this ratio muscle weight divided by body weight so what about the impact of apigenin in the old mice so we can see that the two highest doses for the tibialis anterior ta resulted in a higher muscle weight to body weight ratio and then similarly the middle dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram of apigenin increased the muscle weight to body weight ratio for both the edl and soleus so what about muscle function so to assess that they looked at grip strength and treadmill running distance so first when looking at grip strength we can see that again there's an age-related reduction in uh muscle strength which is well well documented that's been shown you know lots of times before but then old my supplemented with each dose of apigenin 2550 and 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight each uh significantly improved their grip strength so what about treadmill running distance so again age-related decline red line and then the two highest epigenetic groups 50 and 100 milligrams per kilogram had increased uh treadmill run run distance so epigenetic improves muscle mass and aerobic capacity now what about frailty so to assess frailty they use a composite of 31 different measures one of those measures being muscle muscle function but there were other measures too cognitive and and other measures that were included in the 31 31 assess 31 assessments of a combined assessment for frailty sorry so okay first when looking at the old mice we can see that they had the highest frailty score with the black line but then the the two uh uh epigenetic at 50 and 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight significantly reduced this reality score so important data uh potentially for older adults so um okay so how does this translate into a human equivalent dose so for the just using the 50 milligrams per kilogram uh dose as a reference but mostly because that was the the dose the lowest dose that uh displayed consistent effects for both muscle mass and uh muscle function uh the human equivalent dose would be uh 288 milligrams per day for a 71 kilogram person also factoring in the uh body size you know uh the body size um accounting for body size from mice to humans divided by 12.3 so 50 divided by 12.3 multiplied by 71 gives you 288 milligrams per day so can we get 288 milligrams per day of epigenetic from food i mean my preference is to get it all from food some may get it from supplements um so uh but can we get it from food so first dried parsley has more than 4 500 milligrams of apigenin per 100 grams of of dried parsley so to get 288 milligrams using dried parsley you would need 6.4 grams per day not too bad uh so what about fresh parsley um so fresh parsley has 215 uh and a half milligrams of apigenin per 100 grams of food and to get to the 288 milligrams per day of epigenin that was a human equivalent dose potentially to get those muscle related effects in the last study we would need about 134 grams per day so about five ounces of fresh parsley a day now chamomile tea is pretty popular too for having epigenin but i looked at the actual studies for the tea not necessarily the extract of the chamomile you know the chamomile plant or leaves which can be alcoholic extract it can be water-based extract it can be other you know fat based extracts so when i look at the actual tea how much is in it with in published studies there's a lot of variability in how much epigenin is in chamomile tea in one study 91 milligrams of epigenetic per 500 ml mils was found and um so that's about two six one sixteen ounce cup of uh chamomile tea would have 91 milligrams of epigenin so you'd need about 1.6 liters to get to this 288 milligrams per day of apigenin however in another study there was significantly less epigenin found in the chamomile tea and it ranged depending on the source you know uh which which version of chamomile tea uh that they that they analyzed so they analyzed like uh 13 different chamomile teas so the range for epigenin in those teas was as low as one to as high as 24 23 and a half milligrams per 500 mils so using the median value for that about 12 milligrams of epigenetic per 500 mils you would need a lot of chamomile tea i mean 6 000 liters so there's no way you can get that much epigenet so there's a lot of variability in the epigenetic data in terms of chamomile tea so i wouldn't use that as the primary source uh to try to boost epigenetic levels in the diet just when considering there's so much variability in how much chamomile tea can actually have now so as a last note it's important to know that there are no active randomized controlled trials in people that have evaluated whether epigenetic supplementation can actually affect muscle uh in either young or older adult humans so whether or not the mouse data will translate into people for now that's unknown alright that's all i've got for now uh made it to the end thanks a lot i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
