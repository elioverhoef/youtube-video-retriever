## Transcript

Which biomarkers are most predictive of biological age if you're familiar with the channel then your guest may be rdw as that's a significant predictor of morgan lavine's dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno ag but what about other biological age clocks so to address that we'll take a look at this paper and if you're interested in checking out the paper yourself the link will be in the video's description so first starting with clinical labs and these are generated by one of the two major lab testing companies in the united states lab core and then on the y- axis we've got years biological age either older or younger and then that's when compared with per standard deviation increase for each biomarker sdx in terms of biological age we put up a red line at zero so biological age equals chronological age at zero and then an older biological age would be above that line and a younger biological age would be below that line so we've got about a 5-year difference above and below the line so if your guess was the rdw here too it is associated with an older biological age but it's not associated with the oldest biological age there are other biomarkers if your second guess was metabolic health glucose and hba1c then you are in the in the ballpark for having the right answer so relatively higher levels of glucose and hba1c are associated with an older biological age in this study but also note that a adiponectin is on the list too and adiponectin is produced by fat cells i haven't done a deep dive into adap anon's role in health and potentially longevity so these data suggest that relatively higher adenon is associated with an older biological age for those who have studied adap entin more closely if you want to get give a head start for the channel to post a video about what's optimal for adap ancon uh start a com you put it in the comments and we'll see how the data how the data looks all right on the other side of the equation though is albumin and i've mentioned this before in other videos but albumin is probably the most underrated biomarker when when it comes to biological age and even potentially health in general in this case relatively higher albumin is associated significantly associated with a younger biological age and note that those data are both in men in red and women in blue and then next to it we've got total protein but note that total protein equals albumin plus globulin so the plot the data for total protein looks almost identical to the albumin data which shouldn't be a surprise because albumin is a component of total protein and then we've got two more biomarkers that are significantly associated with a younger biological age the absolute level of lymphocytes and the lymphocytes and the relatively higher levels of a lymy percentage are associated with a younger biological age and there are videos on the channel for what's optimal for absolute levels of lymphocytes if you missed that i'll link to it in the right corner all right so are these associations also present when using a different lab so it's interesting to have associations using one lab but if we see similar associations using a different lab with different people that would add more strength so this is an external validation or an external replication of these data or a potential external replication and to take a look at that second test or second lab testing company we'll take a look at clinical labs generated by quest same approach biological age a red line at zero equals chronological age above the line is an older biological age below the line is a younger biological age relative to the chronological age so once again we can see that glucose and hb1c are on the right side which is actually the wrong side in older biological age so relatively higher glucose in hba1c across two two different lab testing companies quest and lab corp are associated with an older biological age and we can also see at adiponectin once again relatively higher levels associated with an older biological age but where the story gets more interesting or at least is somewhat of a surprise is we can see that blood levels of lead are associated with an older biological age and in the same ballpark as having relatively high levels of glucose and hba1c so i haven't measured lead levels on my own yet props to people props to those who have done that that will be on the next round of test for me coming in september and in terms of what's optimal how low should we go based on what the published literature shows i'll have an update video on that coming relatively soon on the other side of the fence in terms of a younger biological age once again we can albumin so relatively higher levels of albumin are associated with a younger biological age in both men and women across two different lab testing companies quest and lab corp so to answer the question which biomarkers are most predictive of biological age when looking at data across two different lab testing companies quest and lab cor we can see that glucose hb1c and adap antin were both assoc or associated with an older biological age across both companies and conversely relatively higher albumin was associated with a younger biological age using both quest and lab corp dat data all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon where i offer blood test consults and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition at home metabolomics at home blood testing with scifox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
