## Transcript

In earlier videos we saw that my biological age using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age is consistently in the 34 to 36 year old age range which is about 13 years younger than my chronological age similarly when using aging.ai and with data that goes all the way back to 2009 and with a lot more blood tests we can see that my biological age range is in the 29 to 32 year range which is significantly younger than my chronological age during that corresponding time period so we can see from these two blood-based biomarker biological age calculators that i have a consistently younger biological age but what's my biological age using epigenetic testing so with that in mind i reached out to true diagnostic and they sent me a couple of kits and in this video we're going to go over data for horvath hannum and dunedin pace so all of those each of those epigenetic clocks and if you're interested in measuring your own epigenetic age i have a discount link from true diagnostic and that link will be in the video's description alright so as a first first step for each of these epigenetic tests how well do they correlate with chronological age what's their association with all-cause mortality risk and then once we've put these data into perspective what's my own epigenetic data so first starting with horvath's epigenetic test or more specifically this is the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or ieaa and this is a measure of cell intrinsic aging so how does horvath's epigenetic test correlate to correlate with chronological age and what's its association with all-cause mortality risk so first horvas epigenetic clock is strongly correlated with chronological age in fact better than every other epigenetic test that exists and we can see that data here so on the y-axis we've got two different iterations of the horvath clock on the left horvath1 and on the right horvath2 and we can see it says mh so dna methylation age or epigenetic age and then that's plotted against chronological age on the x-axis now you can see a lot of different colored dots on each of these plots and each of those uh collared circles is a different cell type so this is a multi-cell and multi-tissue clock and more specifically we got cells from the from breast uh buccal cells or cheek brain cell cerebellum colon cord blood uh dermis or skin and so on so it's a multi-cell and tissue clock and it's looking at the correlation for epigenetic age with chronological age so for both iterations of the of that clock on the left and right we can see uh strong correlations with uh chronological age and more specifically when looking at the numbers we can see that the correlations for horvath's epigenetic tests with chronological age is 0.94 on the left and 0.85 on the right so very strong correlations for horvath's epigenetic tests with chronological age and just as a quick note statistical significance is usually less than a p-value of 0.05 you can see that the p-values for each of these correlations is 1 times 10 to the negative 200. So i i hate to use the term highly significant but these are very significant correlations for horvath horvath's epigenetic tests with chronological age all right what about all-cause mortality risk so horvas ieaa is also significantly associated with it associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and we can see that here this is a meta-analysis of 13 studies that included more than 13 000 people and when looking at the meta-analysis hazard ratio and p-value as shown there we can see that a relatively higher ieaa or a relatively higher horvath epigenetic age is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk now if there's a weakness in that data it's that the hazard ratio is very small so although this is a significant uh association for a relatively higher ieaa or a relatively higher horvath epigenetic age the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality only increases by 1.4 percent all right so with these data in mind the chronological age and all-cause mortality what's my horvath epigenetic age so i have two blood two time points the first was on may 26th of 2022 and we can see that my intrinsic age or my horvath epigenetic age on the first test was 54.99 years which is six years older than my chronological age of 49.3 at that time and then i tested again on july 11th and again we can see that my horvath epigenetic age 53.52 years and that's four years older than my chronological age so we can see an older horvath epigenetic age relative to my chronological age now to that so we're off to a bad start to add insult to injury centenarian offspring so the kids of people who live to older than 100 years or or longer centenary and offspring have a lower horvath epigenetic age or ieaa when compared with age match controls and we can see that here so first looking at i-e-a-a on the y-axis and then we've got horvath epigenetic age in centenary and offspring which is the orange bars when compared with the age match controls in gray bars and then we can see for the centenarian offspring that they have a significantly a lower uh horvath epigenetic age when compared with the age match controls so note that i don't have longevity genes uh the longest lived person in my family was to date 95 years so this may be one possible explanation all right so that's the bad news but there is good news so let's get into that and the start of the good news is data for hannah's extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration otherwise known as eea and this is a marker of immune system aging so first just like we did for horror vast tests how is the hanom epigenetic clock related to chronological age and all-cause mortality risk so hannah's epigenetic clock or eea is significantly correlated with chronological age and we can see that data here so again starting on the y-axis where we've got dna mh or dna methyl age dna methylation age we're more specifically epigenetic age for the hannam clock plotted against chronological age and when using that multi-cell and tissue clock just like we did or we saw for the horvath test we can see a significant correlation for hannum's clock with chronological age now note that the correlation for the handheld clock isn't as strong as for the horvath test the correlation coefficient is 0.68 but we can again see that very low and statistically significant p-value of 1 times 10 to the negative 200. All right now it uh horvas sorry hanum's test isn't just significantly associated or correlated with chronological age a relatively higher eeaaaa or hanum epigenetic clock test score is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and we can see that here using that same meta-analysis of 13 studies where we showed data just show data for the horvath test and when looking at the meta analysis has ratio and p-value as shown there we can see that a relatively higher horvath epigenetic age is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk now again just note that that hazard ratio although it's a little bit stronger than what we saw for the horvath test that's a two point nine percent increase for a relatively older hor uh hannum epigenetic age so let's just keep that in mind as we go forward as we go forward before we get into the dunedin pace uh data all right so now that we've seen how good um or or what the data is for chronological age and all-cause mortality for hannah what's my hannah epigenetic age so on the first test in may we can see that my ham epigenetic age was 36.87 years which is 12 years younger than my chronological age at that time and then similarly before going into the second test we should note that why this is considered an immune system aging metric is because it includes many different immune parameters including levels of b cells cd4 cd8 and the ratio between cd4 and cd8 t cells levels of nk cells or natural killer cells total levels of lymphocytes neutrophils monocytes and eosinophils so those amounts are factored into this metric it isn't just epigenetic age it also includes the proportions and amounts of of each of these immune cells all right so what about the second test in july so then relatively consistent data we can see that my hannah epigenetic age was 37.47 years which was again 12 years younger than my chronological so from both tests i've got a 12 year younger hannah uh epigenetic age or eea relative to chronological age all right so next up let's take a look at dunedin pace data so first what is dunedin pace so this is data derived from the dunedin study which is located in new zealand and then pace stands for the pace of aging calculated from the epigenome so it's a pace of epigenetic aging clock so just like we did for the horvath and hadn't test how does done done eat and paste related to chronological age and then how what's its association with all cause mortality risk so here we're looking at the correlation for uh chronological age with dunedin pace data on the y-axis plotted against chronological age and when looking at that data for men in blue and women in orange we can see that dunedin pace is significantly correlated with chronological age more specifically though we can see that correlation is 0.32 and if there's a but the but is that horvaths and hannah's epigenetic tests have stronger correlations with chronological age and just to refresh your memory remember both iterations of the horvath test had correlations uh with chronological age of 0.94 and 0.85 which are both higher than dunedin pace and hannum's was a correlation with 0.68 so so far dunedin pace has a weaker but still significant correlation with chronological age so where dunedin pace shines it's for is for its association with all-cause mortality risk and its ability to detect the biological age reduction induced by calorie restriction so let's start off with the data for all-cause mortality and you can see by the title dunedin pace is as good as as good as the best epigenetic clocks for their association with all-cause mortality risk so first starting with data from the normative aging study and this is a study only in men uh no worries though the second study framingham framingham offspring includes both men and women and then we look on the y-axis we're looking at the mortality effect size the hr is hazard ratio so in other words this is the risk for all-cause mortality on the y-axis and then on the x-axis we've got a head-to-head match-up for many epigenetic tests including dundee and pace the first iteration of dunedin pace uh which is dunedin p-o-a-m pace of aging methylation and we've got horvath and panam epigenetic test there and then we can see phenoage but note that this isn't the blood-based biomarker phenoage metric this is the dna methylation or the epigenetic test that was used for phenoage so phenoage has two tests the blood-based biomarker test that i commonly report on this channel and a separate dna methylation or epigenetic age-based phenoage and then last head-to-head match up with grim age so first we can see what before going into the first so that then at a has a ratio of one where the confidence interval is either completely above one or completely below one we've got statistical significance so when considering that we can see both the horvath and hannam tests their confidence interval overlaps with one so they are not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in that study in the normative aging study in contrast we can see that both both iterations of the of dunedin the dunedin pace and poam and phenoage and grimage epigenetic tests were each significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in this study so so far dunedin pace is as good as the best epigenetic clocks in the same ballpark which in this case would be phenoagent age for their association with all-cause mortality risk all right what about in study number two so this is the again the framingham offspring study which included both men and women and in in this case we can see that the horvath test again has a confidence interval that overlaps with one so it was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in this study but we do see statistical significance for the epigenetic test and also phenoage and grimage you can see that grim age at the far right has the largest hazard ratio or the largest risk associated with all-cause mortality in this study but also note that both iterations of the dunedin epigenetic tests including donate and pace are as good as the best epigenetic clocks or in the same ballpark in terms of hazard ratio and being associated with all-cause mortality risk now so if we've just got a an all-cause mortality risk that's similar for dunedin pace with all the uh you know with the best epigenetic clocks including pheno age and grim age so so what we can use either of those four metrics for epigenetic testing um what's special about the need and pace well a younger biological age for people on calorie restriction is identified by dunedin pace but not by epigenet other epigenetic clocks and for this study this is a study done in people this is not a study done in mice this was a two-year randomized control trial rct of calorie restriction and more specifically the average calorie restriction over that two year period was about 12 percent now the expectation is that people on cr would have a younger epigenetic age or dna m dna methylation when compared with people who could eat as much as they wanted whenever they wanted ad lib and one reason to expect that is because blood biomarker based biological age improve for people on cr and i have a video on that it'll be in the right corner that's a video from a while back so if you're interested in that check it out all right so let's get into the into the data so here we're looking at changes for horvath and hannum for the epigenetic changes on on cal restriction for up to two years and that's we can see there so we've got three measures at baseline epigenetic age epigenetic age after 12 months and 24 months on the diet and then again those two groups so in black we've got the ad-lib people that ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and then the calorie restriction calorie restricted group in red again about a 12 cr over the two-year period and then we can see that starting from baseline and this is going to be the case for each of the six epigenetic clocks i'm going to show starting baseline there were no differences in epigenetic age for both groups they started from the same epigenetic age whether they were in the ad-lib or calorie-restricted group all right so what about changes as a result of being on cr so for horvath we can see that that's not significant and for those that may think there's some group separation between the 12 and 24 month points for ad-lib versus cr note that the cr group would have a trend again not significant though a trend towards an older epigenetic age using the horvath test at least at the 12-month point but again this was not statistically significant and so not no significant differences for epigenetic age for ad-lib for cr on horvath and similarly you can see that the curves for epigenetic change or the change for epigenetic age using hannem overlap not not significantly different all right what about phenoage and grimage which again were able were associated with all-cause mortality risk in both the studies that i just showed so when looking at both of those clocks and for the change in epigenetic age using them we can again see no significant differences for either of these clocks for people on cr when compared with ad-lib now for the pheno age data again it looks like at the 24-month period that people on cr actually had an older epigenetic age but again that data was not significantly significantly different from people on ad lib so we can't conclude anything it's just the you know the the the line goes that way but based on the numbers based on the stats it's not statistically different all right so what about both dunedin epigenetic age measures first starting with the first iteration of the dunedin pace study or the need and pace epigenetic test dunedin poem p-o-a-m on the left so again that too not significantly different so there were no differences detected for the change in epigenetic age when looking at ad-lib versus cr but where we do see changes between group uh changes for the change in epigenetic age is with dunedin pace you can see that ad lib have a significantly older epigenetic age or change in epigenetic age at both the 12 and 24 month time periods when looking at uh the differences between ad-lib ncr so in other words people on cr were detected to have a younger epigenetic age using done eat and pace at both the 12 and 24 month time points when compared with ad lib all right so with this in mind and putting the dunedin paste data into perspective what's my donate and pace data so we can see that here and just going straight to the numbers so my dunedin pace value is 0.8 so what does that mean so on the left we can see the slowest epigenetic aging rate which would be 0.6 and what that means is for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years conversely though the fastest epigenetic aging rate is on the right and that's 1.4 and that means for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years so we can see that my value of 0.8 is on on the right track in terms of relatively slow epigenetic aging obviously i do have some room for improvement as the slowest epigenetic age would be 0.6 so 0.8 not too far away from that though all right now i mentioned that i have two tests so on the 7 11 test we can again see that my donation pace value was 0.82 so i've got consistently relatively slower biological age using the dunedin pace epigenetic age test um based based on this data so that's again that's good news that it's on the right track but there is some room for improvement to get me to 0.6 would be which would be the slowest epigenetic aging rate all right it's a summary so using true diagnostic which provided epigenetic age data for the horvath hannum and true dunedin pace epigenetic tests we saw that i have a relatively older horvath epigenetic age and one reason may be is because i just don't have longevity genes but then we saw a relatively low hanom epigenetic age which would be indicative of youthful immune cell aging and then using donate and paste we saw a relatively slow dunedin pace epigenetic aging or that would be suggestive of a reduced epigenetic aging rate all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and note that there are now discount links which first epigenetic testing using true diagnostic again in all these links will be in the video's description if you're interested in quantifying your oral microbiome that will be in the video's description or using chronometer or if you just want to support the channel you
