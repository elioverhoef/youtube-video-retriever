# Is Calorie Restriction Overrated For Longevity? @Unaging.Crissman.Loomis

## Transcript

See you've been talking about this uh calorie restriction and you've been eating less calories than you need to but the thing is is that you also gave hosted a presentation from uh camille paas if i remember i'm pus if i'm pronouncing his name right so he visited your podcast and he talked about the impact of shli controls on calor restriction and basically as he went through it he found that the calorie restriction that they show in the animals only works in the really small animals like basically the lowest weight animals so for any one of the four interventions they do whether it's in yeast cells or fruit flies or mice the top 10% have no benefit from calor restriction at all and these are even in the animals and it's only in the bottom 10% by weight that get any benefit from it and so a natural question out of that is are humans more like fat rats or like lean rats how long do we live for our size well this has already been answered here's a statistical analysis that went through and it measured every animal they could find on how long it lived versus how much it weighed and you can see down there in the lower left we have mice underperforming the amount of time that you expect them to live given their body weight and then all the way at the upper top top of it we see humans who are live much longer than you would expect for our physical size in fact we live five times as long as would be expected just based off of our weight so when we're looking trying to compare ourselves to these fruit flies or other things none of them live anywhere as long as a human does just based off of how long you would expect something to live based off of their weight and then if we go further into that one of the natural places to look is you're thinking about uh longevity and you mentioned this is one of the things that should be on the tears is the mortality based on body weight for a human so if it was true that eating low calories for an extended period of time was the key to longevity then naturally you would be seeing that that the people who weigh the least would then live the longest but we don't see that at all in fact the people who weigh the least actually die 50% have a % higher all cause mortality than people who have a normal bmi of between 20 and 25 so it only starts to go up as as we mentioned before when you start to get into a heavy bmi but if you're in a normal range there's really not that much benefit from eating less calories and you could say well i'm doing calorie restriction i'm not just losing weight well the people who are doing calorie restriction almost all of them are very low bmi an average of around 18 or so which is at the point that it's significantly increased all cause mortality and this has already been uh data has already been cleaned to remove the smoking people one way to lose weight unfortunately is to smoke um it's also been corrected for the level of activity and exercise and class and and age and other things so this is basically saying that the humans that are living in the normal range can't get any additional benefit just from trying to reduce their calories and live a life of deprivation you want to go ahead and uh give some uh give a swing back yeah so if we're starting with the 900 day rule um a major takea away from that paper too was that uh cr was one of the few interventions to consistently allow mice to live longer than 900 days so if 900 days if median lifespan 900 days is a short live control cr was one of the few interventions where consistently the uh mice live longer than 900 days and if i can if i can uh share screen here so i can show that data can't share you've got to give me share privileges there we go all right hang on real quick yeah so if you look at one of the recent studies uh that just came out and i don't know wait let's see if you can see what i see let me uh go full yep all right okay okay so this study uh just came out and there for those who haven't seen it videos on the channel um the importance of this study and not to say this is any different from the 900 day rule but it it's additive because this is uh recently published so it wasn't available when uh camille's group published uh his data anyway this study included 960 mice so that's a key point because when you look at any life span studies if your if your two groups or however many groups have eight mice per per intervention or controls it's not adequately powered to look at lifespan so each of these five groups eat as much as you wanted ad lib one day of fasting two days of fasting 20% cr 40% cr five groups 960 mice in total divide that by five that's how many mice were in each group a lot of mice grant and also it's in female mice so i can't say anything about male mice in this study so when you look at the 900 day rule that's about 30 months right here median lifespan so compared to ad lib you can see that relative relatively short lib was but an increase in lifespan relative to the short live uh ad li eat as much as you wanted both one and two days of fasting so maybe you can cross off one and two days of of fasting as being potentially relevant because it increased lifespan relative to the uh short live controls who live shorter than 900 days you could also make that same claim about um or actually where now where you start to see the liband curve go beyond 30 months or sorry sorry now then even 20% cr you can see 20% cr median lifespan is right at n is right at 30 months 900 days so um you there too you could say okay 20% cr no extension of lifespan if you use the uh 900 day rule and you know basically your ad lib there those are short live controls but then you can see 40% cr very clearly way past the 30-day rule so you could say okay the 40% cr is pretty extreme almost nobody can handle that and where i i prefer nuance to everything you just mentioned is that um while it's true that absolute cr is probably bad right it's you can't say uh eat as little as possible have a bmi of 18 right i i that's something i've never proposed ever and i never would propose right it's it's find the body weight and body composition that's associated with your best biomarker profile in terms of how does that biomarker look bi how do those biomarkers look in terms of youth and their association with all cause mortality risks so in other words it used to be calorie restriction with optimal nutrition c r n i'd add to that c r n and optimal biomarkers so konob right so i guess i just phrase and it's probably a terrible name we can come up with other names but highlight highlight that point just using this study again as an example when using the um not not the 30-day rule but taking it even a step further and looking at uh mice that lived in any group past 35 months which clearly beats the 30-day rule right so you can see that even in the mice that ate as much as they wanted there was still a pretty good amount that lived longer than 35 months and got close to the you know 40 more than 40 months which is long live for a mouse and obviously as you go up the groups you know uh fasting uh there you know there are more mice in in the both cr groups that live past 35 months but the author authors of this study then asked which biomarkers are associated with a longer lifespan without even looking if if the animals were cr or not right so the one day of fasting they weren't cr two days of fasting ended up being cr so you have two groups that are essentially not cr and three groups that ended up being cr so in terms of biomarkers that were associated with a longer lifespan regardless of which group those mice were in having higher levels of lymphocytes at a relatively young age 16 months ass iated with a longer lifespan and on the other side having a higher rdw which as many people know on the channel is a major predictor of biological age using dr morgan lean's bi biological age test feno age having a higher value for that regardless of group group designation was associated with a shorter lifespan so these data aren't just in mice these this story is similar in people the rdw increases during aging this is in people again and a relatively higher rdw is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and conversely lymphocytes decline during aging just like they did in that giant mous study uh with lower levels of lymphocytes being associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so just to go back to your original your original point it isn't an absolute cr where lower is better get your bmi as low as possible i look at it is find the magnetude of cr that's best associated with your most youthful and quote unquote healthy low all cause mortality risk biomarker profile uh but then also how do you feel because if you're tired and hungry you're probably too extreme
