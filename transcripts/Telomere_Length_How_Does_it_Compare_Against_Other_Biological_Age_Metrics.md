# Telomere Length: How Does it Compare Against Other Biological Age Metrics?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

There are nine hallmarks of aging and telomere attrition also known as telomere shortening is one of them now before we jump into that data let's just do a quick review of telomere biology so within the cell's nucleus we find the chromosomes and at the end of the chromosomes are telomeres now when cells divide and replicate telomeres shorten such that when cells reach senescence telomeres reach a critically short level so one reason why that's important is because telomeres protect chromosomes from fusing together and to end fusion and also uh they protect against chromosomal instability now telomere length shortens during aging and shorter telomeres are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk i'm going to show that data in a minute but also how does telomere shortening compare against other metrics of biological age so first telomere length declines during aging and that's what we're looking at here for data for females on the left and males on the right and on the y-axis we see ltl or leukocyte also known as white blood cell so this is telomere telomere length tl in white blood cells and as a function of age so how does it change during aging so what we can clearly see in in both women and men is that telomere length declines during aging and this i should mention that this data is from a cohort that included european countries uh data from the u.s but also from israel so uh with this in mind our shorter telomeres also associ associated with an increased risk of death for all causes so a meta-analysis uh that was published in 2018 was uh performed for that uh that included data for 23 studies that looked at the association for shorter to relatively shorter telomeres versus longer telomeres with all-cause mortality risk risk risk of death for all causes and what what they found was that the short of the telomeres there was a significantly uh increased risk of death 26 increased risk of death for all causes with shorter telomeres rather relative to the groups that had for the people that had higher longer telomeres now again this is uh this included data for more than 120 000 subjects and 23 studies but notice that in 13 of these studies there wasn't a significant effect for telomere length with all-cause mortality risk so this made me think well how does telomere length compare against other biological age metrics so first uh and remember i showed that telomere length declines during aging this is a fact i mean there are many studies that have shown this and in uh here's also additional data that's what i've put uh put up here so we're looking again at telomere length on the y-axis plotted against chronological age and we can see that in this in data in this study which is different from the data that i presented a couple slides ago we can once again see the telomere length declines during aging note the correlation coefficient the lowercase r is negative 0.42 which is a about approximately a moderate correlation it's not strong strong would be anything greater than negative 0.5 or greater than 0.5 now in contrast other metrics of biological age have stronger correlations with chronological age in this situation we're looking at the clomera duba i may be saying it wrong apologies if i am saying it incorrectly so the kdm claimer dubal biological age and this includes 12 biomarkers 11 of them being blood biomarkers and systolic blood pressure and if you're familiar with my videos you may have seen me uh present data from the calorie study where people underwent calorie restriction for a two year period and they they exhibited a younger biological age and the way they measured biological age in that randomized controlled trial was with the clomera dubal biological age method now again before showing the data also note that eight of the 11 biomarkers including albumin alkaline phosphatase creatinine c-reactive protein but not high sensitivity c-reactive protein the percentage of liposides white blood cell count the mcv and rdw are also found on levine's phenotypic age calculator so so anyway what we see when looking at the correlation between these this biomarker grouping with chronological age is a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 for their combined uh correlation with chronologic chronological age now a correlation coefficient of negative one or positive one as close to those extremes as possible is indicative of stronger correlation so we can clearly see that the correlation of chronological age for kdm biological age is seems to be better than uh the correlation for telomere length with chronological age so what about all-cause mortality risk so in this study i posted that data and telomere length was uh compared uh against um well not against but the association between telomere length and eight other biological age metrics with all-cause mortality risk was compared in this study here so first we can see that telomere length was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk so how did the other uh biological age metrics compare in the study so they looked at four different epigenetic age uh clocks dna m which stands for dna methylation age so oh they used horvath's initial uh epigenetic clock they use the han epigenetic clock dna and phenoage which is morgan levine's epigenetic clock or one of them and then dna grimage which i um talked about in my previous video so actually grimage is also a horvath clock so three of these clocks were actually significantly associated with an increased all-cost mortality risk and in their cases an older epigenetic age was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk which again telerum length was not associated with all-cause mortality risk in this study now but they also found other biological age metrics including cognitive function so better cognitive function was associated with a lowered hazard ratio a lower lower risk of death for all causes and then the fai which is the functional aging index which included vision hearing pulmonary function grip strength and gate speed and then the frailty intake index which included 42 different frail frailty measures so the fai and the fi were also significantly associated with it all caused mortality risk so six of the nine measures were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk whereas telomere length was not now also note that a measure of physiological age what they call physiological age which included some blood biomarkers including hemoglobin glucose cholesterol april b and triglycerides and some clinical markers including bmi uh body size metrics like waist to hip ratio weight waist circumference hip circumference but then also systolic and diastolic blood pressure note that in addition to telomere length not being associated with all-cause mortality risk neither was this physiological age metric now at least in this study metrics one could conclude that metrics other than telomere length were better for their associations with all-cause mortality risk which is similar data to the aging data that i showed for the kdm biological age versus telomere length for their correlations so uh as a third bit of evidence for the argument that maybe telomere length is not a great measure of biological age when compared with other biological age metrics in this study they compared measures uh health health span related metrics including physical function balance grip strength motor coordination and physical limitations uh some measures of cognitive function including cognitive function at 38 years but then also cognitive decline and then some measures of subjective aging including self-rated health and facial aging and they looked at correlations between those measures with telomere shortness with three different epigenetic clocks including a 353 cpg epigenetic clock 99 cpg epigenetic lock and then a 71 cpg epigenetic clock so that just means how many uh sites they looked at methylation at uh and then also they uh looked at the kdm biological age the same kdm or a similar kdm measure as to what they what i showed on a couple slides ago in this for this kdm they looked at 10 biomarkers not 12 but it's they used a similar approach hence it's under the kdm uh umbrella so what did they find so we're looking at the little r which is the correlation coefficient and the p-value statistical significance and for telomere shortness the only measure that was significantly correlated health span related metric that was associated with telomere shortness was facial aging so how did the other measures compare so interestingly two of the epigenetic clocks 353 and the 99 cpg epigenetic clocks none of the health span related measures uh were associated with these two epigenetic clocks so again that shows that not all epigenetic clocks are the same for their correlations with uh health and aging related measures but the 71 cpg clock with the exception of grip strength was significantly correlated with all of the measures of physical function and cognitive function and subjective aging measures so what about kdm biological age interestingly it was significantly correlated with all of the physical function cognitive function and subjective aging measures so when considering this data one could say that some of the epigenetic clocks and kdm biological age may be better metrics for assessing health span related metrics when compared with telomere length and that's what i've stated here so that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks a lot and i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
