When we hear about cholesterol usually what comes to mind is ldl and hdl as shown here but there are other forms of cholesterol that impact health and these include lipoprotein a so lp little a but also remnant cholesterol which is uh defined in the fasting situation as the combination of intermediate density lipoprotein idl and very low density lipoprotein vldl and again in the fasting state this can be calculated by the formula total cholesterol tc minus hdl minus ldl equals remnant cholesterol or idl plus vldl so in this video i'm going to talk about vldl so why is vldl important first it's a marker of fatty liver so uh let's walk our way through this data so in the situation when there's obesity and insulin resistance and or a hyper caloric diet these situations uh trigger an increase in lipolysis so fat breakdown in adipose tissue which leads to systemic increases in free fatty acids ffas now also note that a hypercaloric diet on its own can induce increases in circulating levels of free fatty acids so increased circulating levels of free fatty acids are then taken up by the liver where they are packaged into tgs triglycerides and then with an increase in triglycerides in the liver this leads to accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver which is known as steatosis now additionally when there's an increase in lipid droplets in a given tissue in this case the liver uh these lipid droplets are packaged with cholesterol and other membrane proteins into vldl so if there are increased circulating levels of vldl that can be one measure of a fatty liver so also note that vldl increases during aging and higher levels of vldl are associated with heart disease related outcomes so let's have a look at that data so here we can see uh aging related data for vldl and in youth uh defined as men that are 15 to 24 years old men and women that are 15 24 years old we can see that vldl less than 20 in men and less than 15 in women is found in youth and then going uh through aging so going from 25 years old up to 79 years old for both men and women we can see that vldl levels increase up to about 30 in both men and women so also note that higher levels of vldl are associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk and in this case cardiovascular disease was defined as risk for acute myocardial infarction so heart attack sudden coronary death and other coronary death so in this study when using less than 20 milligrams per deciliter for vldl as the reference we can see that having vldl in the 20 to 29 range or uh greater than 30 was associated with a significantly increased risk for adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes so for in the 20 to 29 range it was associated with a 38 increased risk and a vldl greater than 30 when combin when compared with less than 20 was associated with a 44 increased risk for these adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes now other studies independent of the you know the association for vldl with cardiovascular disease risk other studies have evaluated associate associations for remnant cholesterol with cardiovascular cbd uh cardiovascular disease risk so uh if you remember on the first slide remnant cholesterol in the fasting state is def defined as the the sum of vldl plus idl now uh it may be that remnant cholesterol is almost exclusively vldl so here's my uh just as an example my my data from my last blood test and it includes total cholesterol hdl vldl and ldl and if you remember the calculation for remnant cholesterol which equals total cholesterol minus ldl minus hdl again and only in the fasting state we can see that my vldl equals 13 and there's no idl so from this i would posit that studies that have reported remnant cholesterol in the fasting state as i'm going to show these three studies going forward when they report remnant cholesterol it's almost exclusively vldl so in this study remnant cholesterol but not ldl cholesterol was associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease and in this case cardiovascular disease was defined as risk for heart attack stroke or cardiovascular death so was hdl or ldl associated with these adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes and this is in the study of about 6 900 subjects so first hdl was not associated with these adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes as you can see when comparing people who didn't have a cardiovascular event with people who had a cardiovascular event hdl levels were not significantly different and then when looking at it as a continuous variable so higher levels of hdl are they associated with uh risk in other words the hazard ratio did it increase uh and it didn't you can see by the p value similarly ldl was not different between the two groups no event versus event and higher levels of ldl were not associated with a higher risk a significantly higher risk for any of these cardiovascular disease related outcomes in contrast remnant cholesterol which again this is data in the fasting state so it is likely mostly from vldl we can see that higher levels of remnant cholesterol were found in people who had a cardiovascular event when compared with no event and then for every 10 milligrams per deciliter increase for remnant cholesterol there was a 21 increased risk for having one of these adverse cardiovascular disease related events now while that says that higher is higher for remnant cholesterol is associated with worse cardiovascular disease related outcomes it doesn't uh indicate more specific values for what could be bad for uh increasing risk so to assess that the authors of this study then looked at quartiles of remnant cholesterol in in association with risk for heart attack stroke and cardiovascular death or cardiovascular death and when using less than 17.5 as the reference for remnant cholesterol we can see that significantly increased risk for one of these adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes was present only when the remnant cholesterol was about 30.95 or around 31 or higher so just to summarize that remnant cholesterol greater than about 31 milligrams per deciliter is associated with a significantly increased cbd risk when compared with lower values in this case less than 18. Now other studies have also shown a higher levels of remnant cholesterol to be associated with atherosclerosis and premature heart attack risk so for some people that have relatively low weight low ldl the progression of atherosclerosis so fatty streaks in the in the vasculature is not eliminated so why is that so in this case in this uh study the authors looked at risk for the presence of having a significant amount of coronary uh atherosclerosis and this data is in 134 people with an ldl that is purported to be optimal less than 70 milligrams per deciliter and 110 of these people were taking statins almost all these people were taking statin and had what's purported to be optimal levels of ldl cholesterol so uh what variables were associated with atherosclerosis in people who have low ldl so first they looked at diabetes uh diabetes and hypertension and each of these was were not associated with having a significant amount of coronary atherosclerosis in contrast having hdl less than one millimolar which translates into about 39 milligrams per deciliter so having low hdl in the presence of low ldl less than 70 was associated with the threefold higher odds for having a significant amount of coronary atherosclerosis but the highest risk was present for remnant cholesterol people who had higher levels of remnant cholesterol had about a fourfold higher risk for the presence of a significant amount of coronary atherosclerosis so from this we can conclude that low ldl combined with high vldl or low hdl may be bad for the progression of atherosclerosis now in another study there was a higher odds for premature heart attack with higher levels of remnant cholesterol but note that they also looked at the association for premature heart attack which is defined usually as someone who had a heart attack younger than 55 and men and younger than 65 and women in this case the study included 35 year olds so this is at a much relatively younger age so not only did they look at uh levels of remnant cholesterol in association with premature heart attack risk they also compared a whole bunch of other variables and variables that were significantly associated with premature heart attack risk were non-hdl cholesterol so the sum of ldl lipoprotein a idl and vldl higher levels of that uh about a threefold higher risk of a premature heart attack higher triglycerides a higher remnant to uh divided by hdl cholesterol ratio higher total cholesterol a higher ldl to hdl cholesterol ratio and then higher levels of apob 100 containing proteins which is the sum of ldl lipoprotein a idl and vdl but notice that the highest risk for having a premature heart attack 3.87 fold higher risk was present when remnant cholesterol was elevated so based on the data that i've shown you uh it seems that having lower levels of vldl when considering the aging data and the data for adverse cardiovascular disease related outcomes that lower would be better for vldl so uh what's my data i've been tracking vldl for uh since 2005 so how am i doing with this biomarker now from 2005 to 2013 i was tracking my blood test results about once a year and not tracking my diet or or or as rigorously as i have been for the past six years so during the pre-diet tracking phase i measured 10 times the ldl 10 times and my average level during those times was a 13.2 milligrams per deciliter now in 2015 i started entering all of my data into an online tool um chronometer and there are many tools anybody can use any of these online tracking tools myfitnesspal any of them will work as long as you're you know getting the macros and micros and food amounts which i then took that data and entered it into an excel file so then i can look at the average dietary period that corresponds to each of these blood tests and because i have enough blood tests i can look for correlations between my diet with each of these biomarkers to see what in my diet can impact the biomarkers so when comparing when looking at my vldl data from 2015 to the present which is 30 blood tests my vldl i've actually been able to reduce it with an uh to an average of 11 milligrams per deciliter and when comparing these two groups of data pre-die tracking versus the 2015 data and beyond so during diet tracking these two groups of data are significantly different based on a t test but all isn't uh fantastic with my vldl data over the past six measurements my average vldl is 13.3 uh which is significantly higher than the previous 24 measurements from 2015 forward and those two groups of data the 6 versus the 24 are significantly different so my vldl over my last six measurements are are going it's going in the wrong direction so to get it going back in the right direction towards relatively lower values are there significant correlations for my diet with vldl so the variables that i considered for correlations with vldl were mostly macronutrients so total calories total carbohydrate intake my total fructose intake which includes fructose but also uh one half of sucrose because half of sucrose is uh fructose so total fructose intake total protein total fiber total fat but then also the individual levels of fats uh average average per day of course so mufa monounsaturated fats omega-3 fats omega-6 fats and then saturated fats so of all these variables were any of them significantly correlated with vldl and of them the one that was most significantly correlated with vldl was my average daily calorie intake as shown here so uh what we can see is that the higher this is a significant positive correlation so if you can see by the correlation coefficient of 0.6 so that's a moderate strength correlation but the p-value is statistically significant and when it when uh saying that it's a positive correlation that means that as my calorie intake increases vldl correspondingly correspondingly increases so um with the goal of keeping my vldl uh towards the low end of my range uh we can see that uh i should shoot and that's what i've been doing over the past uh six weeks or so um shoot for about 2500 calories per day or less so that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end thanks a lot and i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
