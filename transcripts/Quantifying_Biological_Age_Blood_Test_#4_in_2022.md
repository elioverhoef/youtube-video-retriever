# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #4 in 2022

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so that's the central premise of this channel and with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the fourth time in 2022 so what's my biological age so that test is levine dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own biological age using this test that link will be in the video's description all right so here's that data you can see first that i blood tested on july 11th of 2022 and when entering the nine biomarkers and chronological age we can see that my and chronological age sorry we can see that my biological age is 32.6 which is 16.8 years younger than my chronological now this is just entering data into a spreadsheet if you're interested in screenshots of the actual lab report all of that data will be at the end of the video now note that quest's high sensitivity c-reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so that's the limit of their detection uh so it could be c-reactive protein could be lower than 0.3 it could be anywhere from 0 to 0.3 with 0.3 being the upper limit now in contrast at home blood biomarker testing may be the next frontier for attempting to slow aging so why is that well first you don't need to go to the lab i've always gotten my blood drawn at the lab and you know i save the time if i don't have to go there if i can just do it at home and i can prick a different finger each day using at-home testing and that's important because although i have about 40 blood tests over the past seven years so testing at least five times per year in contrast with at home testing i can prick a different finger each day and generate about 40 blood test uh data for 40 blood tests in six weeks instead of seven seven years so with that in mind i used let's get checked and i and i used their high sensitivity c-reactor protein test to see if it would be as good as the gold standard venipuncture so pulling the blood from the vein so first that's the first question we want to see the what's the answer is at home testing using a finger prick in which you then squeeze the blood onto a blood spot card is that data as good is the data that we get from that as good as the gold standard of venipuncture and note that i got my blood drawn at the quest lab at about 7 30 in the morning so as soon as i got home i then used this at home test so somewhere around 8 30 about an hour later and both of the tests were fasted so then obviously the question is was high sensitivity reactive protein less than 0.3 milligrams per liter using this at home test so here's a screenshot of that data we can see this is high sensitivity c reactive protein and we can see that my value using the at home test was less than 0.2 milligrams per liter so first note that the sensitivity of this test this at home blood test was uh slightly better than the quest lab which is in the lab where they're pulling it out of my vein so to answer the question was high sensitivity uh c-reactive protein less than 0.3 milligrams per liter based on this data it was uh if if there if this at-home test had a c-reactive protein that was higher than 0.3 milligrams per liter i'd argue that it's not reliable in comparison with the uh quest lab in comparison with getting it pulled out of the the vein the venipuncture uh so as a side note i got this test with the intention of getting a discount link that other others could use and even though it's as good as the in in the in the lab testing i'm not promoting it on this channel so uh if anyone's interested about that story just leave a comment and i'll be happy to explain why that's the case so now we can return to my biological age data and instead of less than 0.3 for c reactive protein we can put less we can put 0.2 uh the value from this at home test as the upper limit it still could be somewhere between 0 and 0.2 but we can put 0.2 in there now and when i do that now my biological age is further reduced to 32.2 which is 17.2 years younger than my chronological now this is data for just one blood test so how did these data compare with earlier tests let's have some more context and to do that let's have a look at biological age results using levine's test since 2020 so that's we can see here in 2020 i blood tested six times and my average levine biological age was 35.6 similarly in 2021 over six tests also 35.6 so thus far in 2022 over four blood tests i'm currently lower which is a good thing 33.9 so i'm off to a good start hopefully i can keep it up over the next i plan on testing about three more times this year so it'll be seven blood test in 2022 hopefully i can keep it up or literally uh keep it lower not keep it up all right now note that prior to 2022 prior to the four blood test this year my average biological age reduction relative to chronological age was about 12 years so 11.9 years uh younger than my chronological over 15 tests before before 2022 but in 2022 those reductions have all been better than 12 years in fact my average 22 2022 reduction over those four tests is 15.2 years so i've further reduced biological aids biological age using levene's test by about three years now note that as a limitation phenoage includes chronological age in its model which limits the maximum biological age reduction so even if all these biomarkers don't change uh over time just by increasing chronological age biological age using this test will increase so if i'm 80 the best i can do is about 60 using this test in contrast aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model so greater reductions for biological age are possible so what's my aging.ai biological age and this test is also free to use if you have biomarker data just go to aging.ai and i'm not sponsored i'm not affiliated with them in any way and i hope that this test remains free for all of us for a very long time so when i enter the 19 biomarkers that are found on aging.ai 3.0 as shown there and again if you're interested in the full the screenshots of my lab test data that will be at the end of the video so when i had to enter these data i get a biological age using aging.eye of 28 years which is 21.4 years younger than my chronological so just like we did for the venus test let's have a look at more context so previous data for aging.aih so for aging.ai i have data going back to 2009. Now back then i was only testing blood testing about once a year uh every time i'd go to my my yearly physical with my doctor i'd record that data in an exp excel spreadsheet so from 2009 to 2013 i only have data for three tests and we can see that my average aging.ai age was 32 years and then in 2016 uh and going forward i decided to start blood testing more often so i can get closer to the picture of what my bio internal biochemistry actually is rather than only going once a year which in my opinion is not representative of a full year of data so from 2016 to 2021 over 27 tests my average aging.ai age was about 30 years or 29.9 so what about 2022 well thus far over the first four tests in 2022 my average aging.ai age is 28 and a half so again off to a good start further reduced when compared with the last five years using aging.ai now note that i've been able to keep my biological age using this test in the 29 to 32 year range so basically i've kept it relatively constant since 2009 so then the big question is how long can i resist age-related biomarker changes so it will that be for the next five years 10 or 50 or more stay tuned i plan on doing this for as long as i live so let's see all right so what's contributing to these biological age reductions supplements fitness and or diet and in the interest of time i won't go over that in this video so stay tuned for that in upcoming videos all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and if you're interested in discount links these will be in the video's description you can get a discount link to measure your oral microbiome composition if you use my code similarly there's a discount code for chronometer so daily diet tracking and then if you're interested in supporting the channel you can go to buy me a coffee and again that link will also be in the video's description all right so thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day and let's get to the blood test data you
