# Is Coffee Associated With A Younger Biological Age?

## Transcript

Coffee is associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here this is a meta analysis of 21 studies that included more than 10 million people on the y- axis we've got the relative risk of all cause mortality in other words risk of death for all causes plotted against coffee consumption in cups per day on the x in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and then we can see that lowest all cause mortality risk was is associated with 2 and 1/2 cups of coffee consumed per day and that's because it's 95% confidence interval those are the dash black lines are completely below a hazard ratio of one but also note that coffee drinkers have a significantly reduced all ca mortality risk for all intakes of coffee as shown by the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval being completely below that hazard ratio of one for all coffee intakes and that's when compared against non- coffee drinkers all right so when considering these data could coffee be associated with a younger biological age and that's what we'll see in this recently published study that included more than 13,000 people and jumping right into the data on the y- axis we've got the odds ratio of pheno wage acceleration so first pheno wage is exactly the test that i've posted many times on this channel this is dr morgan lavine's phenow wage calculator calculator using those nine blood test biomarkers so what is the phenoage acceleration so that means having an older biological age relative to your chronological age so on the y- axis we've got the odds ratio of having an older biological age relative to chronological age and that's plotted against coffee consumption in cups per day on the x once again in terms of what's significant we put up that red line now at the odds ratio of one and first we can see that for people who drank more than five cups of coffee per day this was not associated with phenoage acceleration again having an older biological age relative to the chronological as that shaded red region completely overlaps with the odds ratio of one the lowest odds for having pheno wage acceleration was associated with four cups of coffee per day and then for people who reported drinking less than three cups per day that was associated with the highest odds for pheno wage acceleration in other words having a higher biological age relative to chronological age as shown by the increasing uh red lines as shown there such that people who reported no coffee intake had about an 80% higher odds of having an older biological age relative to their chronological age all right so from this study we can see coffee's potential role they shouldn't have been so sure in the title but it's their it's the potential ro these are associations this isn't a randomized control trial that explored the causitive role of coffee on being able to reduce uh dr morgan lavine's feno age as a metric of biological age so coffey's potential role in slow going down biological aging but is this just healthy user bias so to potentially account for that in this study this model was adjusted for standard variables that could impact the association for pheno wage acceleration with coffee consumption as as shown here age gender bmi and so on down the list now the ones or some of the ones that i care most about are our diet and physical activity are that would really account for healthy user bias do they have a healthier diet and are they just more active so this study included those inj those adjustments including adjustment for for total energy intake or calorie intake the healthy eating index 2015 so whether they had a relatively high diet quality versus not and then they adjusted for physical activity but if there's a weakness in what they included in this model it's that they adjusted for general health in my opinion they could have been more specific adjusting for physician diagnosed uh diseases such as cardiovascular disease kidney disease liver disease and so on down the list because reverse causation could be involved in the less than three cups of coffee being associated with a phen a greater odds of pheno wage acceleration in other words to people who drink less coffee are they do they have comorbid uh pre-existing comorbid conditions and reverse in the reverse of that is that because they don't drink coffee now again these are just associations that speculation but we'll have to wait for the randomized control trials to more directly investigate that question all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to bick aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing any quantification or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with scifox health which includes apob but also grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
