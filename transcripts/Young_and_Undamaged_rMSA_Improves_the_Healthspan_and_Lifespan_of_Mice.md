Young and undamaged rmsa improves the health span and lifespan of mice so first what is rmsa so that stands for recombinant mouse serum albumin so the mouse isoform of albumin a protein that is located in the blood was expressed and then purified from the yeast piccia pasteuris that albumin was then injected into c-57 black six mice so starting from 12 month old mice albumin or saline as a control was injected every three weeks until death and then as i noted in the title of this paper uh lifespan was extended so let's see that data so we've got the data for the female mice so percent survival on the y axis for the male and female mice on the left and then the individual data for the female and then male mice so first starting with the data for the female and male mice we can see average lifespan in the saline injected mice the controls was about 19 months that was then significantly extended and the albumin injected mice now that effect was also true whether looking at only the female mice and only the male mice as we can see first with the female mice we've got the average lifespan for the saline injected mice and then we see the significant extension of lifespan in the albumin-injected mice and then we also see that effect in the male mice now this is a about a 19 increase in average lifespan for so for an 80-year average lifespan of people a 19 increase is about 15 years which is pretty big pretty big gain in lifespan all right now i mentioned that healthspan was also improved in albumin-injected mice so what does that entail so muscle mass and strength spatial learning and memory and phosphorylated tau and i'm going to go through all that data in the upcoming slides and then i'm also going to talk about how is albumin potentially impacting health span and lifespan what's the mechanism for these effects so first in terms of health span related measures that were improved in albumen-treated mice they looked at muscle strength uh so as we can see for the data for the female mice on the left the male mice on the right we can see higher levels of grip strength in the albumin injected mice when compared with control saline injected mice and i should mention uh these data were for 12 for for an eight-month study from when the mice were 12 months old until 20 months of age again they were injected uh once every three weeks with abdomen or saline so two separate groups of mice so what about muscle mass now although we see trends for the female mice on the left and the male mice on the right for higher levels of muscle mass and in this case they measure the gastrocnemius mass which is arrowed in green which is a you know the largest muscle in the in the calf so although we see trends for higher muscle mass and the female and male mice those effects were not statistically significant but note how many dots there are which each dot corresponds to muscle mass in an individual mouse it's possible that the sample sizes that they use to explore whether these are significant effects or not were not weren't large enough to detect this as a potentially statistically significant effect so to uh account for that they looked at the combined data from males and females in the albumin-injected mice rmsa versus the saline injected mice as the controls and now we can see that there is indeed a significant increase in muscle mass in the album-injected mice when compared with controls now there was also improved cognitive ability in the albumin-injected mice and the assessment for cognitive ability that they used was the barnes maze now as you can see by that disc for the barns mate barnes maze there are many holes or many ways for the mouse to escape but the actual escape as highlighted there there's only one actual escape so the mice are trained to find the escape and then at a later point they put the mouse back on the maze and see uh if they can actually finally escape how many of the mice are actually able to find the escape and then how long did it take so in terms of the ability of the mice to find the escape we can see that the albumin injected mice a significantly higher fraction of those mice were able to find it relative to the saline injected controls and then also the the saline when compared with the saline injected controls we took a relatively longer time to find the escape we can see that the abdomen injected mice found it faster so from this we can conclude that there's improved spatial learning and memory in the albumin treated mice now there was also reduced levels of phosphorylated tau in the brains of albumin-injected mice so why is tau important so this is a a scheme of uh microtubules in a neuron and the pathology as it relates to uh alzheimer's disease and neurofibrillate neurofibrillary tangle sorry so first uh in the normal situation tau stabilizes uh microtubules so uh tau being the protein as indicated by the red shapes but then whether when there is kinase activation kinase phosphorylates tau and in the case where there is kinase over activation tau is hyperphosphorylated which leads to microtubule depoly depolymerization so you see portions of the microtubule disassociating from the bigger larger microtubule and when that happens when tau is hyperphosphorylated that causes it to lose normal physio physiological function to gain toxicity and to aggregate thereby forming those neurofibrillary tangles which then accumulate in neurons causing neuronal death and then that activates microglia which then leads to progressive neuronal damage now this is a part of the pathophysiology of alzheimer's disease so what were the levels of pitao so phosphorylated tau in the brains from saline treated when compared with albumin treated mice so first when looking at the data from males females and the males and females together we can see that the male mice that were injected with saline had significantly lower levels of phosphorylated tau in the brain we see a trend but not significant in the female mice and again sample size may not have been enough for whatever reason to detect this is a significant effect we see they only looked at 11 total mice 6 for the saline 5 for the albumin injected and then when looking at both the male and female mice within albumin injected versus saline injected we can see that now there is a significant reduction in phosphorylated uh levels of tau in the in the albumin-injected mice so with this in mind a question that comes to my mind is could albumin injections improve alzheimer's disease-related pathology in people and there aren't any studies for that yet so hopefully there will be now although it's not directly related to health span we can see that albumin treated mice have glossier and thicker fur so when looking at representative mice uh for that or saline injected we can see uh you know poor hair quality some hair loss in the female mice on the left and then a little bit of hair loss uh in the in uh on the right for the saline treated mice but then when comparing the abdomen injected mice we can see that the the hair coats look tremendously better very little hair loss um for both the male and female mice so with all of this data in mind what's the mechanism how are albumin injections impacting health span related characteristics and lifespan so as a first assessment uh they looked at body weight and body weight was not different when comparing the albumin treated when compared with the saline treated mice so the data for the males are on the top and the data for the females for body weight are on the bottom and we can see overlapping data for both the saline injected and albumin injected so we can conclude the body weight wasn't different between the groups now that's important uh because it potentially rules out that calorie restriction wasn't involved in these health and longevity promoting effects now although food intake wasn't reported because body weight was the same we can assume that there wasn't a mild calorie restriction in the albu in the albumin-injected mice which can account for those effects all right now i've presented this data before abnyone decreases with aging and this is data in humans it's more than uh including more than a million subjects and we can see the clear decrease in abdomen levels from youth all the way up to about 100 years so with that in mind were blood levels of abdomen increased in the albumin treated mice as a potential explanation for these improvements in health span and lifespan so this is the albumin data starting from the albumin injection at day zero and then over the 21 days after the injection prior to the next injection and they looked at albumin levels on the y-axis for two different doses of albumin for 20 milligrams in blue and 50 milligrams in red and for the most part it's stable albumin levels didn't with the exception of a two-day period of the 21-day period albumin levels are pretty stable throughout that period uh so from this we can conclude that the album injections did not reverse the age-related decline for albumin in contrast the albumin that they injected into the mice was young and less damaged than endogenous albumin so let's have a look at that data so rmsa so the albumin that was injected had more free thials uh similar levels of protein carbonyls less homocysteine and more age products adducts when compared with endogenous albumin so first let's let's walk through these data so free thials what is that so uh thiols are the sulfhydryl group so sh and and that's when they're reduced in the reduced form on the left but in the presence of oxidative stress those sulfhydryls become oxidized therefore thereby forming a disulfide bridge and you lose the two free dials so free thials can be used as an index of oxidative stress so what did they find when comparing the abdomen injected versus the saline injected mice so that's what we're looking at here relative levels of free styles and and note that we've got the the rmsa so that's the uh albumin that was injected and then the endogenous levels of admin that were found in one month old mice 12 month old mice and 20 month old mice so first note that there is an age-related decrease for free thiols in the mice and that's not a surprise because oxidative stress increases during aging so you'd expect to see a loss of files uh during aging and this is thio levels in albumin in contrast look at the levels of free thials in the albumin that was injected into the mice it has higher levels of free thials which suggest a lower level of oxidatively damaged albumin now they also looked at protein carbonyls as a second index of oxidative stress so just as a quick intro for what that actually means using the amino acid threonine which has a hydroxyl group o h in the presence of oxidative stress that hydroxyl group becomes oxidized thereby allowing for the formation of a protein carbonyl which is character characterized by a c double bonded to o oxygen so what did they see in this study so first they saw that protein carbonyls in albumin uh increased during aging in the mice from 1.5 to 12 to 20 month old mice which again shouldn't be a surprise because oxidative stress increases during aging and then the carbonyls that were in the albumin that was injected into mice had similar levels to endogenous levels of albumin we can see so they've got basically youthful levels of carbonyls so they've got really low levels or relatively low levels of oxidative damage to their abdomen at least based on protein carbonyls now notice that they also had less homocysteine bound to albumin so not only can free thials be oxidized they can also be homocysteinolated and that's what we can see here so starting with a protein bio in the presence of homocysteine they react the sulfhydryls of those two react uh under a process that's known as s homo bus sorry s homocysteine elation and then we can see that the free thighs for both are lost now forming a disulfide linkage between the protein sulfur with the sulfhydryl of homocysteine so in terms of the levels of homocysteine that we're bound to albumin first in the mice we can see that that increases during aging which also shouldn't be surprised because homocysteine levels increase during aging and i have a video on on homocysteine levels during aging so if you missed that it'll be in the right corner you can check it out if you like now in contrast the uh albumin that was injected into the mice had even lower levels of homocysteine bound to it as shown there and that's when compared to the really young mice that were only one and a half months old so it's less homocysteine homocysteine elated it's got less of that bound to albumin now of the fourth uh add up that they looked at was age products in albumin or age product adducts so what does that mean so age products are advanced glycation end products which by definition are proteins or or lipids that become glycated as a result of exposure to high levels of sugar sugars so just as the example i've got albumin as shown here and with its amino group nh that forms a chemical bond with a sugar in this case i've got fructose shown here so that combination of fructose bound to albumin is an advanced glycation end product because it's a protein that's been uh chemically modified by sugar so how do age product adducts in the albumin that was injected into this mice into these mice compare against young levels of abdomen and how does it change during aging so some a similar trend we can see that age product adducts in albumin endogenous albumin in the mice increased during aging and then in contrast the albumin that was injected into the mice had lower levels of uh glycation so less glycated albumin in the albumin that they injected into this mice so in some the albumin that was injected into the mice was young and less damaged based on these metrics including less oxidized less glycated and less homocysteine homocysteine elated so with that in mind is the young and less damaged albumin responsible for these health span and lifespan uh related improvements in the abdomen-injected mice so the one way to explore that hypothesis is by comparing damage to albumin and the mice that were injected with the rmsa versus damage to albumin in the mice that were only injected in saline and that's what we can see here so when looking at those various metrics of damage to albumin and comparing the in 20 month old mice that were given abundant injections every three weeks versus mice that were given saline injections every three weeks we can see that the abdomen-injected mice the albumen in the albumin-injected mice had lower levels of carbonyls lower levels of glycation lower levels of homocysteine bound to albumin now freestyles weren't different though when comparing the albumin in the albumin injected mice versus the abdomen in the saline injected mice so collectively this study suggests that the magnitude of damage to albumin by oxidants sugars and or homocysteine impacts health span related metrics and lifespan so as a last note i haven't gone through why they chose to use albumin for injection into these mice now albumin is the most abundant protein in blood and along those lines uh in a paragraph from this study the authors noted that they can use this approach for other proteins that are not as abundant as albumin but also abundant in blood including immunoglobulins or globulins and fibrinogen so they expect to use this approach to um purify these proteins and inject these purified young and less damaged proteins into aged animals with the goal of potentially further improving health span and longevity now these are great data but just to play devil's advocate it's important to note that the mice that they use in the in this study c-57 black six mice usually have an average lifespan of 30 months whereas in this study the saline treated mice so the controls had an average lifespan of only 19 months so that raises the question were the positive effects for albumin injections related to a potential lifespan reducing effect of the saline injections uh or is this a real effect so uh further studies have to be carried out but it's it's an exciting study with great data so all right that's all i've got for now if you made it to the end i hope you enjoyed the video and you can find us lots of places online including now on patreon have a great day
