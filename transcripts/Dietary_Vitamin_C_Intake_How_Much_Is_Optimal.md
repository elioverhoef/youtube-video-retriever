# Dietary Vitamin C Intake: How Much Is Optimal?

In my last video i talked about why vitamin k intakes greater than what's recommended may be optimal for health similarly today i'm going to talk about why vitamin c intakes greater than what's recommended may be optimal for out so what we're looking at is the rda the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin c intake throughout the lifespan and i've got highlight highlighted with the rectangle the red rectangle the recommended intake for adults that are 19 years old or older for men and women 90 and 75 milligrams per day respectively now higher intakes are recommended for smokers and for breastfeeding women 120 micrograms but at most 125 micrograms per day per day is recommended for vitamin c intake so how much do i take in well my average daily vitamin c intake is plotted here we can see vitamin c and milligrams per day on the y-axis plotted against time so this is two years two full years of data from july 2018 to july 2020 that is a data point each day of vitamin c intake during that period and the solid red line is my average intake during that period so 930 milligrams per day so why so much so first let's have a look at the association between dietary vitamin c intake with all cause mortality risk so risk of death for cardiovascular disease cancer respiratory diseases infection all of them etc so what we're looking at on the y-axis is the relative risk for all those diseases combined and so when you have the solid line surrounded by its dashed lines which is the 95 percent confidence interval well when all that is below one then it's that data is significantly different and in this case it indicates reduce risk for vitamin c intakes all the way up to about 450 milligrams per day now if you really want to look at it more closely you can kind of say that it looks like the lowest all-cause mortality risk is for vitamin c and takes 200 milligrams per day when compared with 400 or 450 milligrams per day but they didn't make that comparison they didn't do that comparison in the study so that's unknown and i should have mentioned that this data is based on a meta-analysis of 14 studies that's a lot of data so what about intakes higher than 450 milligrams for days so to that we'll look at the circulating vitamin c values and how they associate with risk of death for all causes and in this case higher circulating vitamin c levels shown on the x-axis again plotted against relative risk on the y-axis rr for all cause mortality we can see an almost linear decrease in death risk as the circulating vitamin c concentration increase increases so how can we get to the far end of this vitamin c concentration 80 micro moles 80 micro moles per liter or greater so what we're looking at here is a on the y axis a peak plasma ascorbic acid which is vitamin c plotted against the ingested dose of vitamin c so first we can see that the current rda for for men and women we get you into only about 25 micromolar micromolar which isn't very much because again we're shooting for 80 based on the all cause mortality data so how can we get to 80 micromolar for circulating ascorbic acid or vitamin c so i've highlighted that here by the red line at red arrow and to get to 80 micromolar for vitamin c it looks like a thousand milligrams per day of daily intake will get you there now what about higher doses so all the way up to 2500 milligrams per day it looks like there's a small increase in the circulating vitamin c concentration maybe 80 to micromolar versus 78 so is it worth it though to take in 1500 milligrams more i'm not sure so if you remember back to my first slide i mentioned that i average about 930 milligrams per day this data in associate in association with the all cause what mortality data is basically why because we see a thousand milligrams per day basically saturates the circulating levels of vitamin c in the blood so where where can we get vitamin c from now i'm always in favor of whole foods first and supplements second unless foods aren't making a difference so what are the best vitamin c containing foods so to address that i sorted food based on their how much vitamin c they have per calorie which is essentially the definition of nutrient density nutrient per calorie so each of these foods for a hundred calories the vitamin c content that's highest is found in peppers so sweet bell peppers in this case yellow bell peppers have the highest vitamin c 679 milligrams per 100 calories of yellow peppers so i'm not going to go through the whole list but i eat a lot to get my vitamin c nine hundred or more milligrams per day i eat a bunch of red bell peppers two to three a day 14 to 15 ounces but i also get significant amounts of vitamin c in my diet from broccoli and spinach now as a last note if you're if you're interested in optimizing your circulating vitamin c concentrations it's important to note that vitamin c transport into intestinal cells from the diet is mediated by a transporter that also requires two sodium and a two sodium ions so that's what we're looking at here so basically when you eat vitamin c you'll need two moles of sodium for each mole of ase - which is ascorbic the ascorbic anion which is vitamin c so if you're eating a high vitamin c diet but a low sodium diet you'll be limited in how much you actually absorb through the transport into the intestinal cells and that you get into your blood so with this in mind when considering that i averaged around 930 milligrams of vitamin c a day i shoot for about 1,800 milligrams of sodium per day so that i can optimize fully optimize how much vitamin c i've got in my blood so that's all i've got for more info you can check out my whet website and if you've got questions or comments you can find me lots of places online have a great day
