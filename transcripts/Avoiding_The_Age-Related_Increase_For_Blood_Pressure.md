# Avoiding The Age-Related Increase For Blood Pressure

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A major focus of the channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible many of those biomarkers are shown here in today's video we'll focus on the cardiovascular biomarkers systolic and diastolic blood pressure more specifically how does blood pressure change during aging and then also what's my data and then can age related blood pressure changes be improved so let's jump into the data so let's start off with systolic blood pressure which is plotted on the y ais of this chart and on the x we've got age from 18 to 95 years old and this study included about 386,000 people if anyone's come across lge a larger epidemiological study demonstrating age related changes to blood pressure systolic and diastolic greater than 386,000 people please post it in the comments and i'd be happy to include it in a future video and give you a shout out so in this study we can see that systolic blood pressure increases during aging both for data uh with for men in green and women in in blue all right so what about diastolic blood pressure changes that's what we can see here so we can see that it increases up until about 50 to 60 years followed by a decrease for the next 40 years so for diastolic blood pressure it increases and then decreases during aging now when can considering the a inverted u for diastolic blood pressure how can we know if a low diastolic blood pressure is reflective of youth or older age and that's where considering the systolic blood pressure value comes into effect so at older ages we'd expect to see a low diastolic blood pressure in conjunction with a high systolic blood pressure conversely at younger ages we'd expect to see a low diastolic blood pressure in conjunction with a low systolic blood pressure so with that in mind what's my data now based on age expected blood pressure based on what's shown here we'd expect to see 125 over 77 for systolic and diastolic respectively and we can see that plotted there so that that data for 50 to 60y old as my chronological age is 51 years would be a relatively higher systolic and diastolic relative to youthful values which based on the data here presented here in this study youthful blood pressure values average youthful blood pressure values were 118 over 67 for men and 108 over 65 for women now i should note that i'd say that these are the upper limit there are smaller epidemiological studies i have one in mind that included about 6,000 people where the average blood pressure was 100 over 60 in 20year olds so for me that optimal range for blood pressure would be from 100 over 60 to 118 over 67 for men and 108 over 65 for women that that would be my optimal range if anyone's got data that contradicts that please post it in the comments let's all have that discussion all right so what's my data so we're about to take a look at systolic blood pressure this is over the past 14 months from september of 2022 through december early december of 2023 and this is 170 different days of data and note that i'm not using anything fancy this is a standard blood pressure cuff it's an automated system i actually use a brand that's pretty close to what's shown here and then some notes for every one of the 170 measurements they're between 11:30 and 1: p.m. More specifically almost all of those measurements are between 11:30 and 12:00 p.m. I try to standardize the time to minimize any potential variability in blood pressure measurements as a result of measuring earlier in the day versus later in the day so i measure it at the exact same time for all of these or pretty close to exactly the same time for all of these measurements i take the average of five to six tests over about a 15 to 20 minute period for each of the tests because there can be variability in the measurement so rather than testing once and just recording that i take the average of 5 to six test within that 15 to 20 minute time window and then each of these 170 measurements are exactly 4 to 5 hours after eating or drinking so i eat most of my day's calories on for each of these 170 measurements by 7:30 and when're considering that the blood pressure measurements are at about 11:30 that's at least 4 hours no eating or drinking so i've standardize these three things for all of the 170 tests to try to minimize day-to-day variability in blood pressure all right so in terms of the data when i first started measuring in september of 2022 we can see that it was pretty close to age expected somewhere around 123 mm of mercury but then we can see that it's been reduced over the past 14 months such that average systolic blood pressure in november of 2023 over 14 tests was 117 mm of mercury so on the right track what about dioic blood pressure so over the same 170 tests 14-month span we can see that when i started in september of 2022 it was also close to age expected 73 mm of mercury i've also reduced diastolic blood pressure over those 14 months and we can see that the average diastolic blood pressure in november of 2023 was 69 mm of mercury over 14 tests so from both of these data we can see that i've consistently reduced blood pressure since september of of 2022 over the past 14 months so then the question is how one factor that may be involved in these data is body weight so i weigh i weigh myself every morning i've done that for probably since 2015 or so uh and this is uh fasted in the morning body weight and that's on the same day as each of these blood pressure measurements so in other words i have body weight data that corresponds to the blood pressure that was measured on the same day but before getting into that when i first started tracking body weight here for the in september of 2022 it was 151 lbs and i know based on dexa performed in uh december of 2022 that my body fat percentage was 12.9% so already relatively lean but uh an age expected blood pressure pretty close to my chronological age uh in september of 2022 and then we can see that i've uh reduced body weight over the past 14 months such that my average body weight in november of 20 2023 was closer to 141 lbs about a 10b weight loss so then it raises a question what's my uh body fat percentage now relative to last year and i'm measuring that next wednesday so stay tuned for that data coming uh probably very soon all right so these are just trends is body weight significantly correlated with blood pressure and that's what we'll see here so we're going to take a look at systolic blood pressure pressure versus body weight and then also diastolic versus body weight and this is over those same 170 tests body weight measurements on the same day as uh measured on the same day as blood pressure and i'm going to put both of the data up at the same time because the trend goes or the correlations go in the same direction and we can see that there are significant positive correlations for body weight with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other words a relatively higher body weight is significantly correlated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and conversely a relatively lower body weight is significantly correlated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures so from these data we can see that in my case a lower body weight is significantly correlated with more youthful blood pressure now if you've paid if you're familiar with the channel you you'll notice that uh this trend is becoming apparent of a relatively lower body weight and leanness or being more lean relative to last year's 12.9% body fat is significantly correlated with many biomarkers going in the right direction versus wrong for example improved resting heart rate and heart rate variability uh an increased percentage of slow wave sleep and in an upcoming video i'll also detail many other biomarkers that are going in the right direction versus wrong in terms of being correlated with a lower body weight in terms of how those biomarkers change during aging and their associations with all cause mortality risk all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon
