# 15 - 21 Younger Biological Age: Supplements, Diet (Blood Test #7 in 2023)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video we saw that my biological age using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age was about 15 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai it was about 21 years younger so in today's video we'll take a look at what may be contributing to these data so first let's start off with supplements and if you're familiar with the channel the first two shouldn't be a surprise so first i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early to mid 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin ever since then so about half my life and for this test it was 1375 micrograms of libo roxin per day for for the second supplement vitamin d i supplemented with 2,000 ius per day and i used a higher dose than i did for a previous test but i'll get to that in in a second so first note that i took it for 47 of the 49 days that corresponded to this blood test so what does that mean so starting from immediately after test number six which was on october 9th of 2023 through the day before testing on for blood test number 7 november 26th of 2023 that's a 49-day period so for that 49-day period i have an average dietary intake average supplement intake which i then line up with blood biomarkers to look at correlations with the diet and the supplements and then tailor my diet to try to optimize the biomarkers towards youth and health in terms of all cause mortality risk now getting back to that vitamin d dose of 2,000 ius per day i doubled it from where it usually is around a th000 or a th000 supplemental uh ius of vitamin d per day and i did that in part or mostly because of the correlations with biomarkers and i'll get into the what that means exactly a little bit more later in this video so for two of those biomarkers vitamin d was inversely and significantly correlated with lower levels for example a relatively higher vitamin d intake was significantly correlated with lower creatinine as a marker of kidney function you can see that that p value is less than 0.05 and that n is over 47 blood tests or 47 blood tests since i started tracking all of this in 2015 similarly a relatively higher vitamin d intake is was also significantly inversely correlated with glucose levels so higher vitamin d was correlated significantly correlated with lower glucose and that's over 45 tests since again 2015 so rather than looking at correlations i directly tried to test that by doubling my usual 1,000 ius of vitamin d per day to 2,000 and note that over that uh since 2015 i haven't gone above 2,000 ius per day so in that data having when i've had i uh vitamin d intakes of 2,000 ius per day supplemental creatinine and glucose have been lower so i tested that hypothesis and unfortunately creatinine and glucose did not improve so that's a correlation it's not causation at least in the case for vitamin d so with that in mind for the next test test number one in 2024 i'll return to my 1,000 ius of vitamin d per day knowing it didn't impact the biomarkers or at least these two big ones at all for the third supplement methyl b12 1,000 micrograms of methyl b12 per day and that's for 49 of all 49 of the 49 days that corresponded to this blood test so for every day during this period that corresponded to the test i supplemented with methyl b12 and i did that to limit homosysteine as b12 is the only variable of folate choline b6 even serene that's been uh that's made an impact on keeping my homoy levels lower than they could be without supplementation but also b12 intake in my case is significantly correlated right now after i think nine tests with a lower horvath epigenetic age so i'll keep that in the approach i don't yet have the horvath data from that corresponds on this day as i also sent blood for epigenetic analysis so hopefully that stays relatively low in part potentially caused by methyl b12 so for now methyl b12 stays in the approach based on its potential positive effects on these two biomarkers and for the fourth and last supplement i i used nicotinic acid 60 mig per day again a very low dose relative to where where i've been for higher doses i've supplemented with as much as 600 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day with a potential bad effect on the epigenetic pace of aging done ean paast so that's why i'm now down to the lower doses now for this test it was only for 23 of the 49 days as i'm trying to find the dose that i can get an nad boost without potentially messing up the epigenetic pace of aging if nicotinic acid really is causitive in that uh in that role i i just sent uh i intend on sending more nad uh tests in conjunction with epigenetic testing to find that nicotinic acid dose where i can uh maximize nad without potentially impacting uh epigenetic pace of aging so nicotinic acid supplement number four but that's it no other senolytics or geroprotectors which then brings us to diet more specifically what diet composition corresponds to test number seven or this blood test and that's we'll see here this is the average daily dietary intake over that 49-day period that corresponds to this blood test so first we can see the top 24 foods and if you're familiar with the channel you know i rank them in order from highest intake in grams to the lowest at the bottom with the exception of green tea which is listed in ounces and i don't know if i've mentioned this uh in a while i haven't mentioned this in a while but i the green tea that i use is not tea bags i use organic loose leaf green tea sourced from japan as there are studies uh all cause mortality data coming from asia japan and china showing that relatively higher intakes of green tea or drinking green tea is associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk so that's why green tea is basically a staple in my diet so if you're interested in measuring or using the green tea that i use and getting it from where i get it from there's a discount link in the video's description all right so for the second half of the diet that's what we can see here again ranking them in terms of highest intake to lowest and then we can see that i ate 47 different foods that corresponded uh to the 49-day period during this test now a question i often get is why are the foods that i have at the top why are they at the top so let's just go into that a little bit so as i mentioned i use correlations for diet with the blood biomarkers in this case the uh biomarker list includes 25 different biomarkers most of them are blood-based but i do include slow wave sleep and systolic blood pressure as two non-blood based biomarkers in terms of their correlations with diet now for those 25 biomarkers i have data for 9 to 33 test since 2018 as i just started tracking food in 2018 i have data for macros and micros that goes back even further though to 2015 so most of the data though is closer to 30 tests i only have a couple of biomarkers with very little data for example uh nine tests for systolic blood pressure 10 for dhea sulfate with the remainder pretty close to 33 um tests for each of those remaining 23 b markers so strawberries have a plus 11 correlative score and significant in terms of a t value less than 0 0.05 with those 25 biomarkers so what that means is strawberries are significant correlated with 11 biomarkers a net of 11 biomarkers going in the right direction versus the wrong in terms of how they look during aging and their association with all cause morality risk in other words if strawberries were inversely associated with or inversely correlated with blood pressure that would be a good thing because blood pressure increases during aging so that would get a plus one score conversely if strawberries were positively correlated with blood pressure that would be going in the wrong direction because blood pressure increases during aging so i would give that a negative one score in the case of strawberries they have a plus 11 score so they are one of the strongest have they are one of the foods that have one of the strongest net correlative scores in my data in terms of their correlation with the biomarkers so that's why they're at the top now in terms of their average intake since 2018 since i started tracking food intake 407 gam per day when a food has a positive score i eat i purposely aim for above my average intake so we can see that i'm following that correlation a strawberry intake for this test was about 600 g per day all right so next up are collared greens and using the same approach uh correlations for foods with the 25 biomarkers collard greens have it also a pretty strong score of plus seven seven biomarkers going in the right direction or a net of seven biomarkers going in the right direction versus wrong so their average intake since i started tracking food intake is 84 g per day to follow the correlation i aim for above average intake so we can see that about 300 g per day is a lot higher than that average of 84 g per day so i'm following that correlation too but then to illustrate one that i'm not following the correlation or is carrot intake at a relatively high amount of 259 gam per day average for this test carrots have a net correlative score of zero that means that there's an equal number of biomarkers going the right direction uh versus wrong in terms of the correlation with carrots so in that case i aim for average intake uh which is 353 g since 2018 so we can see that 259 is less than 353 so technically i'm not following that correlation so why so as we'll see later uh beta katene has a net correlative score of minus 4 so i aim for my below average intake there so if i was to increase carat intake to meet that correlation to 353 gram per day because there's such a rich source of beta katene i'd have to cut other beta keratin rich foods like the collard greens which have a score of plus seven so for now knowing that collar greens have a plus seven score and carrots have a zero score i keep the collards high while keeping the carrots a bit below their average intake so following you know it's it's following more of one to limit uh the other with the carrot intake and i'll explain more about the beta carotene story a little bit later in the macro and micro section of this of this video all right so were there any experiments for this test that i try to use foods to impact any biomarkers and i did and that involved egg intake so if you saw the biological or blood test number six test 2023 you saw that i included two eggs per week because eggs are a rich source of choline to try to impact homosysteine so choline's converted into betane trimethyl glycine homocystine plus betane yields methine thereby reducing homosysteine so higher egg intake higher choline intake potentially could reduce homosysteine so i wanted to try that experiment starting with two eggs per week for the last blood test so i for this test i doubled egg and to an average of about four eggs per week uh and again that's with the goal of reducing homosysteine but without showing the homosysteine data it's stayed relatively high at 9.8 micromolar so that didn't work so for now i've cut the eggs out until i find or until i get the epigenetic data especially when considering that choline feeds into methylation pathways it's possible that that doubling of egg intake with the higher choline intake could have impacted horvath or denan pace and i don't yet have that data i'm waiting on it it should be a couple more weeks based on how that goes i may reintroduce eggs back into the diet all right so then what about cheet so the diet is purposefully not always clean i try to limit the cheat days or cheat meals to at most no more than two if i go above that i start thinking about junk and craving junk and that's just bad news in terms of long-term dietary adherence at least in my case i found that no more than two cheat meals allows me to be satiated with some junk while keeping me on track for all the other days when i don't have any junk until the next day when i do have junk so for this test those two two cheat mails involved the standard if you've seen the videos in this series for my diet diet composition videos you know that i'm a big fan of chocolate mix with peanut butter so i did that again for this test immediately after test number seven uh i had chocolate mix with peanut butter uh homemade reese's peanut butter cup which was delicious and then i did that on a second day but then i also had some candy starburst to be exact so when calculating the the calories from these two junk foods or you know the chocolate chips and and the starburst it comes out to 955 for the chocolate and $3.99 for the starburst and when adding that together and dividing that by the total amount of calories consumed during that 49-day period it comes out to 1.3% of all calories were from junk for this test so the diet is pretty close to 99% clean and 1% junk all right so this list is ranked in grams which foods are top contributors for calories and that's what we can see here and note that these data are generated by chronometer which is i use to track my diet if you want to track your diet using chronome there'll be a discount link in the video's description so in terms of the food where i get the majority of my calories it's from sardines and that's been true for many videos as sardines have a very positive net correlative score and i won't show that data in this video i may show that in an upcoming video a quick shout out to i've been including the correlations with diet on patreon in a new tier so you may want to check that out if you're interested in the full breakdown of foods macros and micros with those 25 biomarkers so the for the other 10 foods on this list it's the exactly the same as what i had for test number six as the blood biomarkers are mostly youthful so i'm not trying to be inconsistent with the diet or completely blow up the diet or have a very variable diet i'm trying to keep the diet mostly consistent with very small tweaks to try to improve some of the weak spots like homosysteine or horvath or even try to len trying to lengthen tiir length so same 10 foods as for test number six albeit in a slightly different um order all right so what about macronutrients what macronutrient composition corresponds to test number seven so starting with uh calorie intake or energy average daily calorie intake for the 49-day period that corresponded to this test was 21106 and i know you've probably heard me say this a lot for every test for about the past 2 years but 2106 is my lowest average daily calorie intake sequentially every test i've been purposfully lowering it just by a small amount so this is my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in uh 2015 uh actually macros and micros in 2015 and the previous low before that was for test number six 2122 calories per day in terms of protein intake for this test the 49 day average was about 96 gam per day so why that amount where am i getting that amount from in terms of protein intakes correlation with those 25 biomarkers protein has a net correlative score of minus 4 my average protein intake since i started tracking macros and micros in 2015 is 11 10 g per day so to follow the correlation i aim for below average intake when the score is negative hence the 96 g versus the 110 g per day in terms of the percentage of calories from the diet that the protein provides it's about 18% all right so next up fat intake and that's what we can see here average daily fat intake for the 49-day period that corresponded to this test 81 gram per day so why that amount where did i get that amount for that we go to the correlations with blood biomarkers or the 25 biomarkers and fat has a net correlative score of minus one so again one a net of one biomarker going in the wrong direction versus right in terms of those the list of 25 and significant with a p value less than 0.05 so my average fat intake since 2015 is 85 gam per day again when the correlation is negative i aim for below average intake so 81 is below 85 so i'm following the correlation in terms of the percentage of calories fat contributed about 35% of the total calories in my diet and if you're interested in how that fat breakdown goes into mono and polyunsaturated omega-3 omega 6 and so on down the list you can see that here and as a quick note about chronometer it does have a glitch you can see that the when you add the mono poly and all of the fats that are on the list it doesn't add up to 81 gram and that's because although chronometer provides the total fat amount for at least two of the foods in my diet uh cocoa beans and sardines it doesn't provide some of the further breakdown for mono unsaturation ated fat for example so there's about a 20 g deficit in between adding up what you see on the list and the 81 g but a that's a systematic error my diet is mostly consistent so i'm not too worried about those two foods uh having and chronometer having about a 20 g shortfall all right next up carb intake which is what we can see here total carbs 287 g 49 day average for this test again which seems like a lot and i know i've said that in earlier iterations of this video series but note that net carbs equals carbs minus fiber average fiber intake for this test was about 80 was 82 1 12 g per day so when we subtract that from total carbs we get a net carbs of about 205 gam per day when multiplying that by 4 calories per gram we can see that net carbs provide about 39% of total calories now also within carbs i don't uh look at correlations for total sugars but i do look at correlations for total fructose and that's because the diet is rich in vegetables and fruit which have fructose for example beets and carrots have a lot of fructose strawberries have a lot of fructose and fructose has a net negative corative score although i won't go into uh into that in this video which is why i keep an eye on it to keep it relatively low so total fructose when looking at fructose plus sucrose divided by two as sucrose is half fructose total fructose was 58 gram per day which seems like a lot but again i've mentioned this in earlier videos that's close to my lowest fructose intake since i started tracking it in 2015 which was 575 gam now i've also mentioned this in earlier videos i've had fructose intakes double this amount that corresponded to blood test so this is a small wind to have a fructose intake about half of that all right now also note that soluble fiber as a component of the total fiber category is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids or scfas so in other words fiber provides some calories that can be included into net macros and that those calories are about 2 calories per gram of fiber yielding 175 calories from fiber about 8% of the total calories in the diet that can be added to total fat and with that in mind we can then see that my net macros with adding the fiber calories 8.3% again which can be included to uh added to the fat column total fat is about 43% net carbs 39% and total protein is about 18% all right so what about micronutrients so let's start off with vitamins and it may be hard to see i wanted to get all of them on the list uh so you may have to go full screen if you haven't already to see all of the little numbers cuz it's probably uh small font now a couple of things to note is that there's full rda coverage for anyone starting on this approach with the goal of optimizing both biomarkers and and using diet to do that a good starting point is to at least make sure you get full rda coverage now how far you should go above the the rda uh for me relies on the correlations with the blood biomarkers as many micronutrients on this list are purposely higher so to illustrate two of those let's take a look at vitamin k which has a plus5 score and you can see that my vitamin k intake is about 2400 micrograms per day now the rda or what's considered an adequate intake is about 100 microgram so i'm about 24x the rda now that's not uh um by accident that's intentional because vitamin k has a plus five net correlative score with those 25 biomarkers so we can see that my average is significantly uh below that so i aim for above average intake with a positive five net correlative score to file the correlation conversely we can see that beta keratin in in my data has a net correlative score of minus 4 so if i were again as i mentioned earlier if i were to increase carot intake that would raise my beta carotene levels and that would not be following the beta keratin correlation and i'd be cutting collared greens which would would when considering they have a plus seven score i'd be potentially weakening whatever effect they may have on blood biomarkers or mostly blood biomarkers of those 25 so beta carotene has an average intake of about 53,000 micrograms or 53 milligrams since 2015 to follow the correlation i aim for below average intake since the net score is negative so i'm following it as you can see the 50,000 micrograms or 50 mig of beta katene is below the 53,000 mgram average all right what about mineral intake and that's what we can see here now what i'd like to highlight about mineral intake is comparing it to test number six and we can see the full mineral intake as shown there now note that if you go through the list test 6 versus test number seven on the right you can see that it's purposely consistent and as i mentioned earlier the goal is not to blow up the whole system it's it's to stay mostly consistent and make very small changes in targeted areas based on the correlations for diet with the blood biomarkers so just to illustrate just to reiterate test test number six mineral intake very uh purposely similar to test number seven as shown on the right all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and i should mention on patreon i've added a couple more tiers including early or i've added things to tiers too includ including early adree video access so on youtube you've got probably ads like crazy ad free videos uploaded a day before at least a day in advance on patreon and then also as i mentioned earlier i established a new tier with biomarker correlations with diet including macros micros and foods with the 25 biomarkers that i just showed in this video and then once the epigenetic tiir and metabolomic data comes in i'll put those correlations on patreon 2 we've also got discount links so if you're interested in that check it out discount links for epigenetic and t testing nad quantification oral microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob diet tracking green tea which i mentioned earlier or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand which is what i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
