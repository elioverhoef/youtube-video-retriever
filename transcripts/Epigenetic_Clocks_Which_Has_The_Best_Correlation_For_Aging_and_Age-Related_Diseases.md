By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

There are many epigenetic locks but which clock is best or clocks is best for uh its correlation with chronological age or other aging related uh phenotypes including cancer cell senescence or mitochondrial dysfunction so to address that question the latest paper from morgan levine's group published less than two weeks ago addresses that issue so let's get into the data so first there are there have been 11 epigenetic clocks published since 2011. So let's just briefly go through each of them so the first epigenetic clock was published in 2011 by bachlan's group and they used methylation data from two sites that were able to predict 70 of the variation in chronological age so then in 2012 the gary nani group sorry if i'm messing up the name used data for one methylation site and identified a stronger correlation 0.92 a correlation of 1 would be perfect so 0.92 is very strong with chronological age in 2013 hannah's group used data for 71 methylation sites and identified an even stronger correlation with chronological age 0.96 and then the epigenetic clock that many of us know about the horvath clock which is what my dna age uses um was this so far the strongest of the bunch they used methylation data for 51 tissues and cells across 353 methylation sites and identified correlations of 0.97 and 0.96 in different data sets with chronological age in 2014 the wideners group use data for 99 to 102 methylation sites and identified correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 with chronological age so then in 2016 lin's group 99 methylation sites 0.93 correlation with chronological age later that year the vidal brallow uh group and yang also uh used uh their uh methylation sites so eight methylation sites in vidal braless group uh with 0.97 and 0.67 uh correlations uh with chronological age in training and validation cohorts uh and then yang's group they use data for 385 methylation sites but identified very weak correlations with chronological age in cd4 and monocytes so immune cells and then in late in 2017 uh jang's group uh used ten meth methylation sites and didn't measure chronological age but uh associated that with all-cause mortality risk acm risk and then in 2018 uh levine's group looked at data for 513 methylation sites and identified correlations of 0.68 and 0.74 with chronological age and then steve horvath's group published another epigenetic clock and updated from their earlier 20 2013 clock and use data for 391 methylation sites and again identified strong correlations with chronological age 0.9 and 0.95 so in this paper they used data from these clocks and compared them against each other so the first comparison is how do each of those each of these clocks compare in terms of their correlation with chronological age so to address that they looked at correlations uh they looked at data from uh pooled from 16 cell and tissue types including breast cheek brain colon cord blood skin monocytes so immune cells and other cells so using that pool data then they they then looked at the epigenetic age acceleration across all the different cell types so which one was best so here we have all 11 clocks and their correlations and the best performing epigenetic clock for their association correlation with chronological age was the initial horvath epigenetic clock in 2013. So we can see that the correlation was very strong 0.94 with a highly significant p value and interestingly the more recent horvath epigenetic clock had also a strong very strong correlation of 0.85 and when comparing the other epigenetic clocks we can see that many of them had very weak or or or poor correlations with chronological age including yang with correlation of 0.23 or or negative 0.49 um so and so on so uh based on this data horvath both of horobats epigenetic clocks were the best predictors of chronological age so what about other aging related phenotypes including cancer so to address that they looked at epigenetic data for six of the epigenetic clocks and with the expectation that they'd see a higher epigenetic age in tumor samples from breast colon lung and pancreas when compared with normal tissues that didn't have cancer so which of the epigenetic clocks were best at predicting cancer essentially and the answer for that is levine and yang's epigenetic uh clocks we can see that here that the red are the tumor samples in each of the various tissues and we can see a higher epigenetic age for the levine and yang epigenetic clocks uh when compared with the normal tissues now also note that where the whereas the horvath epigenetic clocks were best for their correlation with chronological age in contrast they were not significantly associated with a higher epigenetic age when compared with normal tissues for uh any of the the breast colon lung or pancreas uh tumor cells so not all the epigenetic age clocks are the same at least in terms of their predictive ability for aging or cancer so far so what about cell senescence which epigenetic clock is best for identifying cell senescence so again they looked at six of the eleven clocks um in in this analysis and uh the ones that were best were the levine and lin uh epigenetic clocks so i'll get into the henna in a minute first let's go through the lin and levine so what are we looking at here we're looking at epigenetic age acceleration and going from less senescent cells on the x-axis to more senescent so more specifically the ep our early passage cells these are less senescent cells and then ns are nearly senescent cells ois are oncogene induced senescent cells and rs are replicatively senescent cells so the going from the left side of the x axis to the right side we're going from less than s into more senescent so in terms of the levine and lin epigenetic clocks we can see that going from the less senescent cells to the uh near senescent and replicatively senescent cells there's an increase in epigenetic age now uh there wasn't a significant increase going from the early passage cells the less senescent cells to the ois the oncogene induced senescent cells for either of those clocks in contrast that's what we see for the hanum epigenetic clock so that's the only clock that saw an increase in epigenetic age for the ois cells when compared with the non-senescent cells so again not all the epigenetic clocks are the same and their ability to detect cell senescence cancer or chronological age there is there isn't one so far there isn't one epigenetic clock that's best across all of them so what about mitochondrial function which is again uh mitochondria function declines with age it's mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging so to address that they took cells that had normal mitochondrial function 143 b rho positive cells and then they depleted mitochondrial dna in these cells which is uh rho uh rho zero minus cell so that's those are cells that are mitochondria mitochondrial uh have depletions in mitochondrial dna and when there's depletions of mitochondrial dna they have dysfunctional mitochondrial dna uh they have this dysfunctional mitochondria sorry that aren't able to produce atp as well and produce more reactive oxygen species so in that situation one would expect a higher epigenetic age acceleration in cells that have depleted mitochondria dna so that's what we would look at here with uh red first versus uh blue so which epigenetic clock was best for identifying um mitochondria epigenetic age acceleration in the mitochondrial mitochondrial depleted cells and in this case uh four of the six were good so levine uh horvath's 2018 epigenetic clock the lin and yang epigenetic clocks uh also all saw significant increases in epigenetic age uh acceleration compared with the uh cells that had normal mitochondria in contrast the initial hormone clock that was great at its for its correlation with chronological age and the hanum clock did not see significant increases in epigenetic age in the cells that had depletions for mitochondrial dna now uh each of the data i already showed compared the individual clocks so uh they then took a basically composite of as much of the data from all 11 clocks to derive a new epigenetic clock a meta epigenetic clock so how does that associate with all-cause mortality risk acm chronological age ca cancer cell senescence and as i'll get into the next slide alzheimer's disease neuropathology so first we're looking at all-cause mortality we can see that the metaepigenetic clock was better than the two best uh previously best performing clocks the levine and jang clocks for the uh for the correlation between epigenetic and older epigenetic age with all-cause mortality risk so here having an older epigenetic age using the meta-epigenetic clock had had a more than six-fold increase in all-cause mortality risk whereas the levine and zhang clocks identified lower uh all-cause mortality risk around three so the metaclock was double that the risk is double that for a higher epigenetic age so what about uh the association with chronological age so we can see that in the lower left panel uh and interestingly they so first they they looked at data from uh four different tissue types including whole blood breast brain and then skin cells and whereas uh the horvath clocks had very strong correlations of 0.85 or higher for epigenetic age with chronological age in contrast the metaclock was not as good as the initial horvath clock so this again goes to the to the point of not all epigenetic clocks are the same in terms of their ability to correlate with chronological age or the individual disease-related phenotypes and even in this case we see the metaclock is better at all cause mortality risk but not as good as predicting for predicting chronological age compared with some of the other clocks so what about cancer uh so here too a significant increase in epigenetic age uh the red compared with the blue so normal cells so tumor cells in red for the breast colon lung and pancreas uh so there's a significant increase a higher epigenetic age with the metaclock versus uh normal normal cells now what's the problem perhaps the most interesting or one of the most interesting data for the metaclock is its association with cell senescence so that's that's that's we see here so whereas none of the clocks by themselves uh were associated with uh a higher uh you know senescence so going from ns to ois to rs um the levine and and one of the other clocks were uh there were significant uh gosh there were significantly more a higher epigenetic age acceleration for two of the measures of senescence but not all three in contrast the meta epigenetic clock all three measures of senescence so uh when compared with the early passage cells were significantly higher uh so an older epigenetic age for each of those senescent cell types when compared with the uh less senescent cells when using the metaclock and last the metaepigenetic clock is associated with alzheimer's disease neuropathology so we're looking at here are the standardized betas which are each positive uh which indicates that a higher epigenetic age uh for the meta epigenetic clock is associated with more amyloid with more noridic plaques with more nft neurofibrillary tangles and a higher tangle load again for a higher meta epigenetic clock epigenetic age so as a quick summary not all epigenetic clocks are the same whether they're predicting chronological age cancer cell senescence mitochondrial dysfunction or in the case of the metaepigenetic clock there's a new novel association with alzheimer's disease neuropathology so that's all i've got i hope you enjoyed this video have a great day
