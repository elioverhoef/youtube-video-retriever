For blood test number four in 2023 i sent blood to true diagnostic for epigenetic analysis and we saw that my epigenetic pace of aging as identified by don and pace was 0.98 to put that into perspective for every one year of chronological aging that's one year of epigenetic aging and you can see i've got that colorcoded in red which is going in the wrong direction for someone whose stated goal is to break the human longevity record so blood test number five results just came in although i sent that sample in august or august 21st of 2023 it takes four to six weeks to get results so did i have a bounceback test and we can see that my den and pace for the august test was 0.75 so indeed i had a rebound in in the in a good way in in the right direction in other words for every one year of chronological aging that's 0.75 years of epigenetic aging now where the story gets interesting or potentially interesting is that without that 0.98 test my average dedan pace over the past three tests is 0.7 77 and that's potentially important because it would put me into the top nine overall in the rejuvenation olympics more specifically for people who have done and pace scores at least three done and paces over six plus months that will put me into a tie for number nine so if you're interested in measuring your own epigenetic age discount link in the video's description or epigenetic aging rate now where the story gets potentially interesting for a second time is that i also sent blood for ned analysis on july 5th at the same time when i sent the sample for epigenetic analysis and with the standard standard chem panel so i sent that sample for nad analysis to gfinity also discount link in the video's description and on that day ned was 67 micromolar now that's in green because my baseline levels are or that's in green because that's generally high based on age related trends for gin's cohort but also relative to my baseline over many tests baseline ned is 20 to 25 microl so that's a 2 to threefold increase for ned on on the same day as that test now what about ned levels on the august 21st test i also sent blood on that day for ned analysis and there we can see that ned went back to my baseline of about 22 micromolar which is relatively low based on age related or or what's expected based on chronological age and note that i didn't take nicotinic acid na or n any other ned precursors prior to that test whereas on for the top test i i took nicotinic acid which is how i got that big bump so these data raised the interesting or at least interesting to me question is ned or intracellular blood intracellular levels of nad is that significantly correlated with d and pace i now have five blood tests that correspond so den and pace and ned measured on the same day so is there a direct correlation and that's what we can see here so there is it's significant you can see that correlation coefficient is 0.97 and the p value is less than 0.05 so in other words a relatively higher blood intracellular level of nad is significantly correlated with a higher denum pace and that's going in the wrong direction for the epigenetic pace of aging now i wouldn't take these data too seriously this is only five blood tests we'll have to see how this story plays out over time but it does indeed suggest that having ned levels that are too high uh may be bad for the epigenetic pace of aging although that one test may be an outlier driving the the whole correlation now it also raises the question is 40 micromolar for any d the upper limit to not mess up the need and pace and you can see that i've highlighted that with that red arrow as the and pace was still around 08 or less so that may be the upper limit and in future tests for ned and donan pace i'll explore whe whether that's the upper limit maybe it's 35 micromolar what's the what's the limit for or what's the optimal nad where i can optimize mitochondrial and potentially cellular function and not mess up epigenetic and epigenetic and other biomarkers so stay tuned for that in upcoming videos all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification atome metabolomics or microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with scifox health which includes apob diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die tring brand which i've got on right now that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
