In an earlier video we saw that relatively low dhea sulfate is a weakness in my data more specifically we can see that here so on my last blood test on august 22nd dhea sulfate levels were 129 micrograms per deciliter now if i only focused on the reference range i would miss this as a potential weakness in my data so why is that first dhea sulfate levels decline during aging so they increase up until about 20 years of age afterwards they decline up to 80 years old on this plot now when showing my most recent data of 129 micrograms per deciliter which is three and a half micromolar we can see we can see that i'm low for my chronological age but potentially more importantly i have two data points from my early 30s and when plotting that data we can see that i was once relatively high and now i'm relatively lower and if you look at the two lines the red line and the black line it looks like they're somewhat parallel in other words it looks like i've experienced an age-related decline for dhea sulfate at least based on these three blood tests so then how is dhea sulfate related to all cause mortality risk or acm risk and we can see that here we're looking at cumulative survival or all cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against follow-up and this was a long study that had a 27-year follow-up although it only had about 400 subjects but note that the average age is pretty close to my chronological age so this data may be directly relevant to me so in that study people that had dhea sulfate levels that were less than 129 had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with people who had higher levels of dhea sulfate in this case it was more than 200 micrograms per deciliter so from that we can see that a dhea sulfate level of 129 micrograms per deciliter puts me at increased all-cause mortality risk so then how can i raise dhea sulfate back to youthful and or healthy levels and note that dhea sulfate is produced by cholesterol degradation and we saw that starting with cholesterol that's converted into pregnenolone which is hydroxylated into 1700 hydroxypregnanolone which is then converted into dhea and then dhea sulfated to form dhea sulfate so to me it made the most sense to raise blood levels of the cholesterol and if blood cholesterol since that's degraded to form the hea sulfate i'd expect that my levels of dhea sulfate would then increase so note that i've tracked diet in conjunction with blood biomarker since 2015 and so then i can see which nutrient is most strongly correlated with blood levels of cholesterol in order to affect dhea potentially affect dhea sulfate levels so in my data and i know that there are published study showing that dietary cholesterol doesn't impact blood levels of cholesterol but in my data when comparing those two metrics dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol 39 blood tests since 2015 and we can see that there blood cholesterol on the y-axis plotted against the average daily dietary cholesterol intake on the x we can see a significant correlation between those two in other words when i've had a higher dietary cholesterol intake blood levels of cholesterol are also correspondingly corresponding higher and note that again this is a correlation that's not causation so from that that raises the hypothesis if i increase dietary cholesterol i should expect to see an increase in blood cholesterol and then i'd expect to have relatively higher levels of dh dhea sulfate when compared with my last test so to test that hypothesis i used at home blood testing and i used the company known as quantify and one reason is because their mission is to radically increase human lifespan and if you're familiar with the the name of my channel is to conquer aging or die trying so our our our models align all right and if you're interested in measuring your own dhea sulfate or other biomarkers i have a discount link for quantify and that will be in the video's description so then i have 16 blood tests for the first 12 blood tests dietary cholesterol my average my average intake was 22 milligrams per day and then i added eggs and then measured the eta sulfate for the next four tests on the next day so my average dietary cholesterol i increased it up to about 212 milligrams per day and we can see that the p-value when comparing those two groups there was a significant increase for dietary cholesterol when comparing the 12 tests versus the four tests all right so then four at home dhea sulfate blood tests the day after egg intake let's take a look at that data to see if it worked and we can see that here so next morning dhea sulfate versus dietary cholesterol as shown there so for the first 12 tests with that average dietary cholesterol of 22 milligrams per day my average dhea sulfate was about 119 micrograms per deciliter and then after uh have including eggs in my diet and measuring dhea sulfate on the very next day we can see that my d my average dhea sulfate over those four tests was 105 micrograms per deciliter now besides looking at averages between the two groups we can compare them statistically with a two-sample t-test and when i did that these two groups are not significantly different in fact one could argue there's a trend towards lower dhea sulfate with the inclusion of more dietary cholesterol but note that those two groups of data aren't significantly different so there was no effect of a higher dietary cholesterol intake on my dhea sulfate so but note that the dietary cholesterol increase didn't raise blood levels of cholesterol and i know that because quantify also provided that data on the same day that i also have dhea sulfate data so blood levels of total cholesterol for the first 12 tests when compared with the next four tests was 106 milligrams per deciliter for both and the p-value was 0.46 so in other words total cholesterol blood levels of cholesterol didn't change as a result of having more dietary cholesterol for those four tests so we can see that there so in terms of the addressing the hypothesis i did increase dietary cholesterol but i didn't that didn't affect blood levels of cholesterol and correspondingly there was no effect on dhea sulfate now if total cholesterol impacts dhea sulfate in my case it may be different for others i'd expect a significant correlation between those two between total cholesterol and dhea sulfate if i'm going to continue with this hypothesis should i just increase cholesterol further or just trash it and go after something else so note that total cholesterol is not significantly correlated with dhea sulfate over those 16 tests so that would argue against going after increasing blood levels of cholesterol as a strategy to increase dhea sulfate so note that there may be a more direct way to increase dhea sulfate and then i i noted besides supplementation of course i can already hear people saying well just supplement fix the problem like that and problem solve but that doesn't address why my dhea sulfate is low and it doesn't get at the root and i want to get at the root so that i can potentially improve that situation you know improve the root cause rather than put a band-aid on on the problem so note that i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s and since then i've been taking uh levothyroxine also known as t4 so my current dose is 137.5 micrograms per day so is there a link between thyroid function with dhea sulfate so there is dhea sulfate is decreased in hypothyroidism and we can see that here so this is a blood levels of dhea sulfate and people that had an average age of 37 years and in the hypothyroid cases people diagnosed as hypothyroid their average dhea sulfate was 2.57 micrograms per ml when compared with relatively healthy controls which had 3.38 these two groups of data were significantly different in other words people that were diagnosed as hypothyroid had significantly lowered dhea sulfate when compared with healthy controls now one study is nice more studies help to see if this may be a real effect or not in a second study where they compared hypothyroid patients with healthy controls and in this case the age range was closer to my chronological age of about 50. We can again see that the hypothyroid patients had significantly lower levels of dha sulfate red arrow when compared with the healthy controls green arrow now note that hypothyroidism doesn't indicate if it's too much tsh or or if tsh is too high or t4 is low t3 is low it doesn't indicate which aspect of being classified as hypothyroid may be related to dhea sulfate so relatively higher is a free t3 are significantly correlated with higher levels of dhea sulfate as one potential factor one potential mechanism and we can see that here so serum levels of dhea sulfate were significantly correlated with ft3 which is free t3 and we can see the correlation there and the p-value being statistically significant so in other words the higher that the levels of free tv the free t3 were in this study a dhea sulfate was also relatively higher so that then raises the question what are my levels of thyroid thyroid hormones including a free t3 what's my data so for that i also used home at home blood testing and this is from a test on october 3rd so just a couple of weeks ago quantified doesn't currently have a thyroid panel so i used a different at-home blood testing company so what what was what's what's my data so first starting with thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and thyroxine or free t4 both of those data were within the reference range now note that if you follow my channel and watch a lot of my videos the reference range is usually not what's optimal for health and longevity so along those lines what's optimal for thyroid function including these three markers of thyroid function will be in a future video all right so what about a free t3 as shown there well we can see that my free t3 is low especially low relative to the reference range regardless of in terms of what's optimal so if i increase my free t3 when considering data on the last slide that free t3 was associated with relatively higher levels of dhea sulfate if i increase that will dhega sulfate also increase so that's my current goal for increasing dhea sulfate i'm going to have to meet with my doctor and probably have to go to the endocrinologist to adjust my thyroid dose and then we'll have to see how that turns out in terms of dhea sulfate now interestingly adjusting my t3 or t4 dose in order to raise my t3 levels may also impact homocysteine which if you're familiar with my data my most recent value was 12 which is aged which is uh higher than what's expected based on my chronological age so we can see that data here when comparing patients subclinical hypothyroid patient patients sch as shown there so this is where they've got elevated tsh but normal t4 and if you look at that data here on this graph or on this plot you can see that tsh was indeed higher in the people who had subclinical hypothyroidism but t4 was not different when compared with healthy controls nonetheless when you look at homocysteine levels in the subclinical hypothyroid group homocysteine was significantly higher when compared with healthy controls now note this is this is an observational study and you know again correlation does improve causation but we can more directly address whether thyroid function may be related to homocysteine by looking at randomized controlled trials rcts that included hypothyroid patients that were treated with a thyroid hormone and we can see that data here so homocysteine is indeed reduced in hypothyroid patients that were treated with levothyroxine again also known as t4 so on the y-axis we're looking at plasma levels of homocysteine and then we've got two groups or actually one group but two different uh situations in the first they were hypothyroid and in this this case they had very poor thyroid function whether tsh was greater than 25 so in the previous studies it was greater than five for subclinical hypothyroidism this is like full-blown uh hypothyroidism where it's the tsh is dramatically elevated and then these patients were treated with levothyroxine in order to restore thyroid status which is known as euthyroid and that therapy lasted from three to nine months so in looking at the data from the left compared with to the right we can see that homocysteine values were 14.1 when they were hypothyroid and after restoration of thyroid status so now now they're euthyroid their homocysteine levels significantly declined to 8.2 so there's a 44 percent reduction for homocysteine upon restoration of thyroid hormone status so that then raises the question will adjusting my relatively low levels of free t3 increase dhea sulfate and or decrease homocysteine and i don't have that data yet but stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now uh if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got some discount links including at home blood testing with quantify oral microbiome composition with bristle epigenetic testing with true diagnostic diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all of those discount links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
