The role of the gut microbiome and its metabolic products on the maintenance of muscle mass muscle composition essentially how much uh fat is within muscle which is not good for muscle health and on physical function in older adults so this is a picture from a review in 2016 that essentially shows that the gut microbiome has been uh implicated in the health and functioning of almost every tissue or organ in the body so i started from the brain it's been linked with autism stress and stroke with the lung uh in terms of allergic asthma it's been linked with the liver not with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's been linked with the skin atopic dermatitis uh it's been linked with fat adipose tissue uh in terms of inflammation and obesity and in terms of the whole body it's been uh linked with type 2 diabetes lupus malnourishment and atherosclerosis notably absent from this review as recently as four years ago is muscle so that's obviously that's what i'm gonna talk about today so um uh so today i'm gonna go over uh so we reviewed the existing literature in 2018 our group um what was known at that time so i'm going to talk about that a lot of that data and then i updated the literature uh based on you know i did a live review uh there were about nine studies that came out last year was a big year for uh the role of the gut microbiome on muscle last year so i updated that uh in a in a review from last year and then what are my contributions to the gut muscle axis so i'm going to talk about a couple studies that our group published in the last six months so uh first let's even see if there's enough data to define a gut muscle axis um so what we're looking at here is um spf these are uh specific pathogen-free mice these are mice that have a microbiome a defined microbiome in comparison with germ-free mice mice that don't have a microbiome they're grown in a bubble and what i highlighted is that muscle in germ-free mice is a lower it's there is less muscle mass in the germ-free mice compared to the microbiome containing mice now uh it's important to also note that body weight was not different when comparing these two groups of mice um because if if body weight was down and muscle was down and liver weight was down is it really a an effect of the microbiome on muscle or is it just an overall effect of the smaller body smaller animal so um they could be the group this group here uh compared the muscle mass to body weight ratio and it was still lower in the germ-free mice which suggests a role for the gut microbiome on maintenance of muscle mass so these data were confirmed in a study last year and again what we're looking at is the muscle weight to body weight ratio and uh they looked at uh various lower uh leg muscles soleus gastrocnemius tibialis anterior ta quadriceps and they compared pathogen-free mice again these are mice that have microbiome with germ-free mice so let's start there so for the gastrocnemius tibialis anterior and the quadriceps the germ-free mice had lower muscle mass uh normalized body weight when compared with the microbiome containing mice so what happens when if you colonize germ-free mice with fecal samples from aged microbiome containing mice um and what happens to muscle mass so um starting with the gastrocnemius we see a trend for an increase but uh the muscle mass the body rate ratio was increased for animals that germ-free mice that received the fecal transplant from microbiome containing mice and also for the quadriceps it was increased so uh collectively these data suggest that there are factors within the microbiome that promote muscle mass so the microbiome isn't just comprised of bacteria it's also comprised of viruses fungi archaea etc so uh evidence that it's bacteria that may be involved in mechanisms related to muscle mass comes from antibiotic studies of antibiotic treatment in mice and in looking at uh these data here uh starting from control animals and then antibiotic treated animals we can see that the antibiotic treated animals have a lower uh muscle mass to body weight ratio for two of the biggest muscles in the lower leg gastrocnemius and quadriceps so um when they in further support that gut bacteria play some role on the maintenance of muscle mass when they remove the antibiotic treatment and then expose those mice to bedding and feces from mice that had had not been treated with antibiotics this allows the microbiome to reseed in the antibiotic treated mice so what happened to muscle mass and what we can see is that it increased in both muscles so these data have been confirmed in other studies at least part of it in terms of antibiotic treatment where antibiotic treatment results in a lower muscle mass to body weight ratio and a couple other studies so collectively these five studies demonstrate that gut bacteria may be involved in uh mechanisms related to the maintenance of muscle mass so that doesn't say anything about which gut bacterial species may be involved in mechanisms related to muscle mass so what about those so um in this study from last year uh the uh knee at knees group compared uh young animals and then what they considered old even though their definition of old were 10 month c 57 black six mice which is not at all old average lifespan is 30 months nonetheless they call them old it's not old but so they fed um these 10 month old mice black bars uh either lactobacillus cassay or the phytobacterium longum and then looked at the muscle weight to body weight ratio for the quadriceps gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles in the lower leg and hashtags were where they saw significant differences so lactobacillus and bifidobacterium increased muscle mass compared to untreated uh mice and bifidobacterium increased tibialis muscle mass when compared with untreated mice so uh separately uh in a leukemia mouse model uh from uh longer a longer time you know eight years ago um so they uh gave uh so muscle mass is reduced in in this leukemia mouse model and when they supplemented the mice with a various lactobacillus species muscle mass was increased so let's have a look at that data so this is the tibialis uh muscle mass lower leg muscle and just weight they didn't look at uh the body weight the muscle muscle mass body ratio so first starting with the controls uh tibialis weight controls plus the lactobacillus uh uh bacteria no effect on muscle mass on the controls leukemia mouse model had a small but significantly different significantly different uh or reduced muscle mass compared to control mice and then when they fed the leukemia mouse model the probiotic species the lactobacillus species there was a small but significant increase in muscle mass um so while these data suggest a role for the gut microbiome gut bacteria and individual bacterial species on muscle mass it doesn't say how that they could do that so let's take a look at how this could possibly happen so um metabolites produced by gut bacteria can affect muscle mass and one group of metabolites that can do that are the short chain fatty acids which are produced by the bacterial ferment fermentation of dietary fiber which have been shown to increase uh muscle mass so um that's what's shown here so um in a study from last year um they looked at the gastrocnemius muscle weight divided by body weight in germ-free mice and then germ from mice that were fed short-chain fatty acids so it's important to know germ from mice don't have any short chain fatty acids are in their feces because they don't have a microbiome to produce them they can't degrade dietary fiber to prove short chain fatty acids so when you give germ-free mice short chain fatty acids their gastrocnemius their muscle mass divided by their body weight is increased and just to highlight these are the short-term fatty acids that they gave them were uh acetate propionate and butyrate these are two carbon three carbon and four carbon fatty acids hence the name short chain fatty acids so going into old mice um in this study they gave butyrate only one of these short chain fatty acids starting at 16 months of age until 26 months of age 26 months of age is pretty old in a mouse like i said earlier the average lifespan in c56 uh black six mice is 30 months so six 26 months is relatively old so first uh we can see that there is an age-related decrease in muscle mass of the gastrocnemius soleus tibialis anterior quadriceps again lower leg muscles in the mouse so white bar the black bar it's decreased in each of these muscles indicated by the stars so what happens when they fed butyrate so young mice fed butyrate compared with unsupplemented young mice no effect no effect in any of the muscles for the young mice but when they fed the older mice starting at 16 months of age or 10 months butyrate when they fed them butyrate each of these muscles the muscle mass body weight ratio was increased so hashtag hashtag which again supports a role for the short chain fatty acids on the maintenance of muscle mass both in young and old animals now whereas there are metabolites that positively affect muscle or can positively affect muscle in animal models conversely there are also gut bacteria derived metabolites that can negatively affect muscle now one of these is called indoxal sulfate and doxosulfate is found in the blood from microbiome containing mice but not it's not found in germ-free mice thereby identifying it as a gut bacteria derived metabolite so in vitro endoxanosulfate negatively affects muscle development muscle development proceeds from satellite cells which differentiate into myoblasts which under uh undergo further differentiation and proliferation into myotubes which then fuse undergoes several several cycles of fusion to form mature muscle endocrine sulfate negatively affects each of these um components so first um in the presence of endocytosulfate when controlled with untreated myoblasts there is less myoblast proliferation in the presence of indoxa sulfate so uh so then uh going forward um when myotubes are exposed to uh endosulfate they uh uh they shrink they atrophy and uh there are also less myotubes in the presence of indoxa sulfate so at least two of these components of the road from satellite cells to mature muscle are negatively impacted by endosulfate so what about the impact of doxosulfate on mature muscle so uh indoxin sulfate is a uremic metabolite meaning that its levels are elevated in the presence of kidney disease so to simulate that condition uh the authors of this study remove the kidney so uh these are animals that have only one kidney and then they uh injected in doxyl sulfate uh daily for 12 weeks and then looked at various outcomes and what we can see is that in in doxo sulfate treated mice there was a reduction in muscle mass for the tibialis anterior for the soleus and the gastrocnemius each of the muscles had decreased muscle mass but i should also point out that body weight was also decreased as a result of the indoxa sulfate uh injections so is this an effect on muscle mass or is this a bigger you know effect on body size that's not known and studies haven't replicated the in vivo effects uh but hopefully at some point in the future i can go after studies uh related to that so um in addition to endoscopy sulfate another uh uremic metabolite this time known as pericreasol sulfate uh can negative effect skeletal muscle uh and again skeletal muscle is not found in conventional conventionally raised microbiome containing mice or it is found in conventionally uh raised microbiome containing mice it's not found in germ from mice thereby identifying it as a gut microbiome derived metabolite so uh exposure to pericreational sulfate negatively affects muscle composition in this case indicated by tissue lipid content so um uh mice that were injected with uh pericreasol sulfate uh once a day or twice a day something like once or twice i can't remember but for a month had increased levels of lipids within muscle and it's important to note that um they also had a mouse model of chronic kidney disease which is a situation where there's also an increase in muscle gastrocnemius muscle tissue lipid content and just by itself pericreasol sulfate was almost able to replicate the adverse effects on muscle composition compared to the more extreme case chronic kidney disease so just as a quick intro why is muscle composition important well in older adults uh poor muscle composition in this case indicated by increased lipids within and or between muscle skeletal muscle cells it's associated with insulin resistance reduced mobility and physical function frailty and an increased all-cost mortality risk so collectively all the data that i've shown so far suggests a supportive role for gulf microbiome derived metabolites on muscle mass and composition so what about the role of the gut microbiome on muscle function so uh physical function is reduced uh in both germ-free and in antibiotic treated mice so first in germ-free mice compared with um microbiome-containing mice there's decreased grit strength and then germ-free mice compared with uh microbiome containing mice have a reduced swimming endurance uh capacity that's what's shown here in both of these uh these two studies and then when you treat uh microbiome containing mice with antibiotics an intervention that reduces gut bacterial content uh we can see that half of the colony uh or half of the cohort uh that was treated with antibiotics um is exhausted at about 100 minutes where the non-antibiotic treated mice exhaust signif you know much later at about 150 minutes so antibiotic treatment negatively affects endurance treadmill endurance capacity uh so again this suggests a role for the microbiome on physical function but it doesn't tell us about gut bacterial species that can affect muscle strength or endurance capacity so which could those be so um uh similar to the study that i mentioned earlier where they call it 10 month old mice old which isn't again they they're they fed lactobacillus cassave or the fidobacterium lung and they also saw increases in grip strength compared with unsupplemented mice so we see the lactobacillus and the photobacteria had higher grip strength compared with unsupplemented controls and then uh swimming endurance capacity and the germ-free mice uh was reduced compared to mice that have microbiome but then uh feeding germ-free mice bacteroides fragilis increased their swimming endurance capacity um in another study uh so when looking at um four groups four separate groups of germ-free mice pre-supplementation with various uh bacteria and then after supplementation with various bacteria uh eubacterium rectally shown here in clostridium cocoides shown here had higher swimming endurance capacity when compared with germ-free mice that were not supplemented with bacteria and then in a study another study published last year uh they um gave into uh mice that actually had a microbiome so they increased the amount of valence bacteria that were in the mice and they saw an increase in treadmill endurance capacity so uh similar to what i showed earlier while it suggests a role for individual gut bacterial species on physical function uh it doesn't say anything about how these gut bacteria can affect function so what about bacterial factors that can affect physical function so once again the short chain fatty acids are involved so whereas they improve muscle mass they also improve muscle strength so we see that here uh germ-free mice jericho mice treated with short-chain fatty acids have a higher grip strength when compared with germ-free mice and then interestingly uh so it's important to note that the germ-free mice that got short-chain fatty acids these were a combination of acetate propionate and butyrate um which may be important because when fiber is fermented it isn't fermented into only butyrate it's fermented into uh you know proportions of each of these short-chain fatty acids um now why that's important is because when aged mice were fed butyrate uh for 10 months there was no difference in grip strength so here we have the control diet young versus old there's an age related decrease in grip strength and then young versus old that were treated or supplemented with buterin for 10 months again there's that age-related decrease in grip strength that was not um attenuated by butyrate supplementation so it may be that feeding short chain fatty acids or feeding fiber it may be important to have all of the combinations of these short chains rather than individually like butyrate in this case so in other studies acetate the other short chain fatty acids acetate and propionate improve treadmill endurance capacity so here as i mentioned antibiotic treated mice in green run a significantly shorter distance on the treadmill when compared with untreated control mice so when you feed antibiotic treated mice uh the short chain fatty acid acetate as shown here they have better treadmill endurance capacity and then um if intrarectal infusion of propionate which is where it would be produced when it's fermented by dietary fiber so propinate in the colon resulted in increased treadmill time in mice which is shown here versus uh injection with pbs so collectively these data support a role for the gut microbiome individual bacterial species and bacterial metabolites on the maintenance of muscle mass and physical function but in mice so what about in humans uh so there isn't a lot of data in humans and i'm just going to kind of highlight a couple key points um in the interest of time so first elite athletes have a different microbiome and higher fecal short chain fatty acids when compared with normal weight and obese controls so what we see here is the unweighted unifrac so that's essentially a measure of microbiome community structure and what we can see is that the athletes in the black dots uh cluster separately i mean it's pretty clear they cluster separately from uh people who had a bmi less than 25 and higher than uh 30 as shown here and then as you would exp well as you would expect based on the animal data the athletes have higher levels of fecal short chain fatty acids as shown here so acetate propionate and butyrate gray bars higher when compared with the uh less than 25 and higher than 30 uh bmi control so athlete athlete athlete higher than the green uh controls so what about an older adults so the first study in this field was 15 years ago van tondren uh his uh look in a small study looked at differences for various gut bacteria when comparing less frail older adults were about 88 years old less frail older adults with more frail all their own what they found was uh were differences for four main groups bacteroides previtala uh pre-vitella can produce short-chain fatty acid propionate uh uh ficale bacterium prasnitzi uh and lactobacillus uh enterococcus uh these three groups of bacteria were higher in the less frail older adults when compared with the more for older adults uh and just to highlight um fecali bacterium are known butyrate produces again pre-vatellar no propionate producers and then if you remember in some of the earlier slides lactobacillus uh species were involved in mechanisms related to muscle mass and and muscle function so um i'd argue these bacteria may be involved also in mechanisms related to at least frailty in older adults now what i didn't talk about yet were enterobacteria and their importance is illustrated um as they were higher in the more frail group and lower in less railroad and these uh data have actually been shown in other studies where enterobacteria are higher and more frail i got i left an extra in in there sorry about that um anterior bacteria higher and more frail when compared with less frail older bells and they'll pop up again in a few slides so it's important to mention that frailty was measured in these studies with a questionnaire that included questions about mobility and physical fitness but it wasn't specific for uh physical function or muscle mass so are there studies that more specifically address the gut muscle axis in older adults so that's where my contribution starts to uh come into this story um i didn't actually have interest in the gut microbiome at all in terms of muscle he kind of evolved out of my my uh findings uh in a in a few studies 2013 2014 and 2015. So what we did is we used a serum metabolomic approach so looking at about three to four hundred different metabolites in blood and how they associated with muscle mass muscle composition and physical function in older adults actually in both young and older adults and interestingly uh i've listed the these metabolites here which are either exclusively derived from gut bacteria or are products of gut bacteria human co-metabolism and these metabolites were associated with uh muscle in in both young and older adults uh and just to highlight uh real quickly if you remember endosyme sulfate and pericreason sulfate were negatively associated with muscle and animal models similarly they were also negatively associated with uh muscle related outcomes in older adults so with these data and other published data i got a few grants published and with that in mind um started to investigate this question so my hypothesis was that gut bacteria are associated with and causally involved and mechanisms related to the maintenance of uh whole body lean mass and physical function in older adults and we published these data last year and it was a relatively small study so two different groups of older adults that we defined as high functioning hf and low functioning lf and our main inclusion criteria was the short physical performance battery spp which includes a few um measures of physical function so we expected to have two groups that were different in terms of uh physical function and in addition uh that were potentially different in terms of body composition and that's what we ended up with so just real quick uh these two groups high functioning and low functioning were not different in terms of percent percentage uh female age and bmi when comparing the two groups the high functioning group had a more favorable body composition including uh uh five percent higher whole body lean mass percentage and a sigma uh also five percent lower fat mass percentage but no difference in bone mineral content bmc and as expected there was better better physical function in the high functioning group but they're defined by the spbb and each of its components um they uh these high-functioning older adults were able to complete a 400 meter walk faster than the low functioning group and the high functioning group also had better muscle strength as indicated by the leg press one repetition maximum so the obvious question is is gut microbiome composition different when comparing these two groups so what we're looking at here is average family level relative abundance when comparing the low functioning group with high functioning group the high functioning group and what we can see is that the high functioning group has more private aca when compared with the low function group now conversely the high function group has less enterobacteria whereas the low functioning group has more about threefold more so uh if you remember earlier in the vanatongren study they actually saw similar findings where more enterobacteria were associated with frailty and uh more privateella were found in less frail older so we kind of see a similar pattern here in our uh not not our cohort wasn't frail so these data are interesting but are they reproducible and so if i would go and get my body composition you know my lean mass my fat mass by dexa or ct or some other means measured and my physical function also measured you know today uh and then didn't change my diet or my fitness approach or my supplements or whatever sleep all the factors and then re-measured a month from now we'd expect those data would be pretty similar um but in terms of gut microbiome studies that it isn't really it isn't it isn't so well studied for people to look at for groups to look at you know are your findings reproducible do you see similar effects uh longitudinally so we wanted to investigate that so one month after the baseline visit we had our our subjects come back and then perform the measures of you know physical function and body composition and we also looked at their gut microbiome composition and if we would see changes in the gut microbiome at the baseline visit that were similarly represented at the follow-up visit this may add additional strength to our findings so once again we saw that pre-vitella were higher in the high function group see that here and uh it looks like the enterobacteria would be higher in the less functioning lower functioning but those data weren't statistically significant and if you remember that we had a total study sample size of 29 subjects it's possible we weren't powered to see this as a significant difference um and then i haven't shown all the data uh you know for differences in bacteria but these are the main findings but we also saw differences in genus level prevotella and bonus yellow and the bacterial species barna barney intestinal hominis uh these bacteria were significantly different uh at both study phys visits so um based on that i'd argue that those bacteria may be involved in mechanisms too related to the maintenance of muscle mass and physical function in older adults so those are associations though how can we test causation so one way that people have done that is by fecal transfer into germ-free mice so we took six fecal samples from the high function group and six from the low functioning group transplanted them into young germ-free mice animals that don't have microbiome waited a month and then look to see if we had high functioning and low functioning mice respectively that correspond with their respective donors so the first step is uh do was do we see microbiome differences when comparing the human fecal donors and their colonized mice and then do we even see differences in body composition or physical function in the human colonized mice so first i'm looking at microbiome differences between the 12 human fecal donors the six high functioning and six low functioning human fecal donors and their microbiome containing mice these are bacterial difference differences at each taxonomic level so phyla class order family genus species and i'm not going to go over all them but i'd predict that the strongest data for a role for the gut microbiome on the maintenance of body composition including lean mass and fat mass and physical function would be present for the findings that we saw in our larger human group n equals 29 our smaller human group n equals 12 the human fecal donors and then if those data were also significantly different when comparing the human microbiome containing mice so for that we see similar differences for each of those three uh groups for private teleca barnes yellow pre-vatella and barnes yellow intestine hominis so now the key question is did we see changes in body composition or physical function because if we just saw changes in the microbiome but didn't see changes in outcome measures it doesn't really mean much so i should have mentioned that we used three mice per each human fecal donor so each fecal sample is transplanted into three mice and because we had six fecal donors for each group that leaves 18 mice that were colonized with two human fecal samples per group so these two groups were matched for uh sex and then we didn't see differences in body weight or uh in body composition and this is was actually a surprise because um whereas in the larger human group we saw differences of about five percent for whole body lean mass and fat mass the human fecal donors were actually more extreme than that there were differences of 10 percent so the high function human fecal donors had 10 percent more lean mass than the low low functioning fecal donors so but nonetheless it didn't it didn't transfer in this study and then when we ran the animals to exhaustion on a treadmill we didn't see a significant difference and then you could even make an argument that the trend would be going towards the opposite direction for the low low function colonized mice to have uh better endurance capacity and i could potentially talk about why that would be um even though it should mention it's close to significance but not significant but then interestingly we actually did see a difference for grip strength so the high functioning colonized mice had a small but significant increase in grip strength so it's shown here so based on these data because of the overlap for those various bacterial taxa that we saw are they related to mechanisms involved in uh muscle strength in older adults so what would next steps from this be so if we transplant those bacteria into germ-free mice would we see changes in muscle strain and if so how um prevatella private elasia and bonus yellow can contain genes that produce these short chain fatty acids are they involved and then conversely if resistance training rt is well known to improve muscle related measures including muscle strain so if we improve muscle strength with resistance training does that affect the gut and if so which bacteria change as a result so uh these are my next steps uh to be pitched in grant uh submissions coming up so um going further from here um earlier this year our group published um the potential role of diet and dietary fiber on the gut muscle axis so earlier i presented data that short chain fatty acids positively impact muscle and dietary fiber isn't um homogeneous meaning it's comprised of insoluble fiber which is not fermented by gut bacteria and soluble fiber which is fermented by gut bacteria to produce short chain fatty acids so how is dietary fiber related to the gut muscle axis very few studies have looked at this only one rct has been performed and in that study um they looked the change in grip strain in response to 13 weeks of soluble fiber supplementation in this case it was inulin and fructooligosaccharides uh so 13-week supplementation in older adults and what they found was looking at grip strength of the right hand and the dominant hand in this cohort um they saw about a 20 increase for the um soluble fiber supplementary group and compared with baseline whereas the placebo placebo group actually saw a decrease in their grip strength over the 13 we studied now uh i didn't mention it but they did not see differences in the grip strength of the left hand when uh for either placebo or the cyber fiber supplementation so to date this is the only study that's looked at it so more study is needed to investigate if dietary fiber can alter muscle related outcomes so it's also important to note in this study even though they gave solid fiber as a supplement they didn't look at changes in the microbiome or short-chain fatty acids so how this could even occur it would be unknown so to further explode the role of dietary fiber and gut muscle axis i recently analyzed data from a large uh study the osteoporotic fractures in men's study also known as mr ross and uh this is unpublished data we should have put it in the paper but uh we didn't but nonetheless so what we're looking at here is the percentage of whole body lean mass uh uh and on the x-axis fiber density so this is grams of fiber normalized to 100 calories so uh if you just look at fiber intake versus lean mass or any outcome measure you know one could argue that higher fiber with higher fiber there could also be higher calories so by looking at fiber fiber density you kind of account for that you're accounting for a calorie intake uh in addition to fiber intake so what we see is that there's an increase significant increase for fiber density with percentage of whole body lean mass so as fiber density of the diet increases there's an increase for the percentage of whole body lean mass so to further investigate this in terms of the microbiome and its functions that could be playing a role we decided to separate that data into tertiles so a group that was in the highest tertile for diatom dietary fiber density and the percentage of whole body lean mass and then the lowest tertiles for those two variables so uh our cohorts uh uh we had 42 in the high fiber density high lean mass group versus 32 in the in the low uh group uh these were 85 year old men women were not included into the study unfortunately to look at the effect for women if it was similar um and then other key uh points here are so are as expected the the um high fiber high lean mass group had about 13 percent better or higher whole body lean mass and about 13 lower whole body fat mass so a better body composition and lower bmi was found in the t3 t3 or high fiber density high lean mass percentage in the mass group but they also were more physically active so we accounted for that by adjusting all of our microbiome models for their physical activity score it's also important to note that this group the high fiber high percentage lean master group also had better physical function so higher physical performance battery score and better grip strength and then as i noted they had a higher dietary fiber and a higher fiber density when compared with the low fiber low lean mass percentage uh group so essentially we have a group that's got better physical function and a better body composition and that consume more dietary fiber so what did we see for changes in bacteria gut bacteria and function so this is a genus level plot visualization so the high fiber high whole body lean mass group versus comparatively the low group and just to highlight a couple of key findings so ruminococcus were lower in the low fiber group and higher you can see that here the orange lots more orange versus the low group and also i've illustrated here tabular format um and actually by percent relative abundance the changes the differences from women or caucus were greatest in terms of uh how much of them were there uh in the high fiber group uh and then conversely uh uh parabacterias were higher in the low fiber low lean mass group when compared with the high fiber group which had less and again we can see that here now what you can't see here because uh these plots are difficult to read when you have much lower relative abundance but clostridium and lactose fire were also higher in the high fiber group and these three clostridium raminococcus and lactino spira are known butyrate-producing bacteria so investigating further we also looked at gut bacterial functions and without going into that data but just noting the key findings we saw that um the genes that produce butyrate were higher in the high fiber high percentage of lean mass high physical function group when compared with the lower group so while these associations are interesting and it suggests a role for dietary fiber on the gut muscle axis and older adults they're just associations so uh in a couple of brands so far this year i've uh pitched uh this idea that a high soluble fiber dietary intervention and coming from whole food and not from uh supplemental soluble fiber and i can get into that the why behind that um uh so a high cyber fiber dietary intervention may possibly affect the gut muscle axis and in and maybe even through short chain fatty acids and other related metabolites so future study so that's all i've got uh ready for questions and uh like if you guys want to find me anyone wants to find me i've got uh lots of uh you can find me in a lot of places so thanks a lot
