# Polyamines (Including Spermidine) Extend Lifespan: What's My Data?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

A polyamine-rich diet including spermidine spermine and putresine extends lifespan and that's we can see here with survival rate plotted on the y-axis against survival time on the x and then there were three diets low normal and high levels of these polyamines these diets were started at 24 weeks of age and these are in these data are in male mice unfortunately female mice weren't evaluated in terms of survival we'll take a look at median survival that's the time when half the population has died and half is still alive and when using that time point we can see that for the normal polyamine group their median lifespan was about 76 weeks now although the lifespan curve for the low polyamine diet was shifted to the right which is going in the right direction that lifespan increase was not significantly different from the normal polymine diet but we can see that for the high polyamine diet 30 percent more mice were still alive on that diet when compared with the normal polyamine diet hence illustrating that a polyamine-rich diet extends lifespan now more specifically sperminine on its own extends lifespan and i covered that in an earlier video and if you missed it it'll be in the right corner now note that these data are in mice could sperminine impact health and potentially lifespan in people so first spermini levels decline during aging and that's what we can see here with circulating levels of spermuding on the y-axis plotted against age and these data these data sorry have an age range of about teenagers to 80 years old and although this is a relatively small study of about 80 people as far as i know there aren't any other studies that have looked at how sperminine levels change during aging so if anybody's seen that data in with a larger sample size please post it in the comments and i'd be happy to give you a shout out and feature it in a future video so for this study we can see that circulating levels of spermidine do indeed decline during aging and that's potentially important because spermining levels are lower in mci or mild cognitive impairment and an alzheimer's disease ad patients and that's what we can see here with circulating levels of sperminine on the y-axis and healthy controls people diagnosed with alzheimer's disease a.d and again in mild cognitive impairment mci and there we can see that the latter two groups have significantly lower circulating levels of sperminine when compared with healthy controls all right so that raises the question what's my data so to evaluate that in april of 2023 i sent blood for at-home metabolomics and this kit may look familiar if you've seen other videos including tryptophan and chin uranine for the day novo nad synthesis pathway i've also used this kit for taurine which provides measurement of taurine and now poly means but beyond these metabolites this at home metabolomics kit also provides information for 500 more than 500 metabolites so if you're interested in using it there'll be a discount link in the video's description alright so when using ilo's at-home metabolomics kit they provided data concentration data for spermuding sperming and putresine which is what we can see here 3.8 1.8 and 0.14 micromolar for each of these respectively which then raises the question how much is optimal so if we look at the data on the left and plot the 3.8 micromolar for sperminine i would be somewhere around here so i think it's wise to avoid the age-related decline which would put me closer to the ad diagnostic and mci groups while also potentially trying to raise my serum levels of spermidine to somewhere around 6 micromolar which was the median value for the healthy controls but note that going too high for circulating levels of spermidine is something to something to consider because serum levels of spermidine relatively high levels of spermidine in blood have been associated with stroke risk so we don't want to go too high all right that's all for now if you're interested in more of my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics which i just covered and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their blood panel is almost exclusively different from iolo's diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
