Resting heart rate and heart rate variability how are they impacted by physical activity body weight and diet so first let's define a few terms so the resting heart rate or rhr is the heart rate in beats per minute bpm while at rest and the heart rate variability hrv is the variability for the time in between heartbeats so if your heart rate is 60 beats per minute the assumption is that it beats once every second but there's variability in how often the heart beats it may be once every 0.9 seconds every one second 1.1 seconds etc so that variability is the heart rate variability all right so how does the resting heart rate change during aging so this is a study of 90 000 plus people we've got average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age from 20 to 85 years and what we can see is that for both women in green and men in blue the wrestling heart rate increases up until about 50 years after which it then decreases all the way up to 85. What about hrv how does that change during aging so this is from a much larger study of 8.2 million plus subjects and here we're looking at the rmssd that's the root mean squared of successive differences that's one metric for measuring heart rate variability plotted against age and in this case it's going from 20 to 60 years and what we can see is when delineating the line for men in blue but the data for women is similar uh we can see that heart rate variability is somewhere in the 70s in it for a 20 year old and then it declines to about half that in 60 year olds for both men and women and note that's for heart rate variability measured in the morning at six in the morning for people that measured at six o'clock at night we can see a similar trend in the dashed blue and uh red lines so uh in advanced age for on both of these graphs we can see that uh that's characterized by relatively low resting heart rate and also a low heart rate variability in contrast youth is characterized by a relatively low resting heart rate at least when compared with 50 year olds but also a high heart rate variability so with the goal of being chronologically old but biologically young which factors can impact resting heart rate and heart rate variability and as mentioned in the opening today uh today i'm gonna go through data for physical activity body weight and diet so uh in terms of a measure of daily physical activity the fitness tracker that i use uh uh also gives me data not just for resting heart rate and heart rate variability but the average daily heart rate so the heart rate for the whole day not just at rest while i'm sleeping in the morning so uh is the average daily heart rate significantly correlated with wrestling heart rate or heart rate variability and that's what we can see here so the resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against my average daily heart rate for each day on the x and what we can see is that the more active that i am on each day that's significantly correlated with a higher next day resting heart rate significantly correlated conversely the more active that i am is indicated by the average daily heart rate we can see that heart rate variability is significantly lower now this raises the interesting idea you know about the optimal physical activity dose that can minimize next day variations in heart rate variability and resting heart rate while also maximizing fitness and that's beyond the scope of this video i'll probably address that in a future video actually i'll investigate it in my data first and then present it in a future video all right so what about body weight is that correlated with heart rate variability and resting heart rate so that data is here and i should mention that the data for physical activity i only had the idea to measure or start tracking recording and tracking my average daily heart rate in march of 2020 although my fitness trackers provided that since i started tracking in august of 2018 i didn't have the idea to record that i didn't see the usefulness of it until unfortunately march of last year but i've been tracking and recording my resting heart rate and heart rate variability since august of 2018 so i have almost 1200 days of data that correspond to my body weight my morning body weight which i've been measuring every day in the morning since uh 2015. So again i've got about 1200 days of data for correlate correlations between resting heart rate on the y-axis against body weight on the x and what we can see is that the higher my body weight that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate and remember youth is characterized by relatively lower resting heart rates but also higher heart rate variability uh conversely we can see now that my the higher my uh my body weight the lower my heart rate variability significantly lower as shown there by the p value and the uh correlation coefficient of little r so this also raises a question you know what body weight optimizes both resting heart rate and heart rate variability and as you can see for both data somewhere around 151 pounds results or is correlated with my lowest resting heart rate but also my highest heart rate variability so i'm currently around 155 and slowly working towards getting back towards 150 151 and even uh you know lower if i can i can get there and sustain it now note that for a given average daily heart rate having a higher body weight on that day would result in a more daily exertional strain in other words if my average daily heart rate is 60 beats per minute and i weigh 150 pounds versus weighing 160 pounds because i'm carrying 10 pounds more weight that's an overall greater daily exertion or daily strain when when compared with only using the average daily heart rate so we can combine both both those metrics body weight and the average daily heart rate into a daily strain or a daily exertion metric by multiplying them both and then comparing them against resting heart rate and heart rate variability so that's what's shown here so on the y-axis we've got resting heart rate plotted against this metric of daily exertion or daily strain and we can see that the higher my daily strain that's significantly correlated with a higher next day resting heart rate again going in the wrong direction and also going in the wrong direction with a higher daily exertion or a higher daily strain is my heart rate variability variability where we can also see significantly lower hrv for a higher daily uh strain or daily exertion so let's put that data aside for now we'll come back to it in a minute i'm going to show some data where we adjust our models for this exertion metric and but also with some dietary variables so shifting over to diet how does diet correlate with resting heart rate and heart rate variability so the first obvious measure or metric for diet would be calorie intake and that's what's plotted here so we've got resting heart rate on the y-axis plotting against my daily calorie intake and for those who don't know i've been weighing all my food since 2015 and then tracking it and logging it into an excel file so i have lots of dietary data uh over the past three plus years that i've been tracking my uh fitness metrics as we can see by almost 200 days of data so now we can see the strongest data of all the data i presented so far the higher my calorie intake that's significantly correlated with correlated with a higher resting heart rate and also conversely a higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability so when considering all the data i just presented this suggests that physical activity body weight and calorie intake can be specifically titrated to optimize both resting heart rate and heart rate variability and i'll go more into depth in future videos to actually see what may be optimal for me now more specifically in terms of diet what about diet composition just calorie intake says nothing about whether it's higher fat higher carbs higher fiber etc so what about correlations and associations for diet composition with these metrics so first i'm going to present the data for heart rate variability with dietary macronutrients because the strongest associations uh were present for that with lesser but still significant associations for resting heart rate which i'll show next now note that in previous videos although i've shown unadjusted correlations between diet with blood-based biomarkers in this case when considering that we know that physical activity body weight and also calorie intake are significantly associated with resting heart rate and heart rate variability variability they should be in any model that looks at potential associations or significant associations for macronutrients with these with these metrics so in this case i uh created linear regression models that were adjusted for or that included daily exertion so that body weight times average daily heart rate and also calorie intake and then also uh each individual macronutrient so there are eight different models each of them have these daily exertion and calorie intake uh variables but then each of the respective macronutrients and note that daily exertion and calorie intake on their own when uh associated with heart rate variability account for a small but significant amount of the variance in hrv so 5.7 now that may not seem like much especially when we look at how that relates to resting heart rate we'll see that daily exertion and calorie intake actually explain more of the variance and resting heart rate but it's six percent you know and that's that the data is what it is all right so what's the data for macronutrients and how they relate to heart rate variability after adjusting for daily exertion and calorie intake that's what's shown here uh the end starting on the left is uh five update it's 593 days of data so let's there's a lot to unpack here let's just walk through it step by step so in terms of macronutrients i looked at uh carbohydrates and i split carbohydrates into two different fractions non-fructose carbohydrates and fructose so i've been tracking both of those uh you know since 2015 so i have data for that uh each of the fatty acids so monounsaturated mufa omega-3 omega-6 saturated fatty acids sfa and then also protein and fiber intake and then we've got the beta coefficient plus or minus the standard error so that's you know are these macronutrients associated with higher or lower hrv the p-value for whether those associations are statistically significant the significance f so whether or not in this case they are whether each of these linear regression models the eight different models for the eight different macronutrients after adjusting for exertion and calorie intake are significantly associated with hrv and as we can see they're all less than 0.05 so they're all statistically significant the adjusted r squared how much of the variance is explained in total by the three variables um the percent explained relative to the base model so how much additional variance in hrv is explained by the addition of each of the respective macronutrients and then average daily intake which we can use which we can use to guide how much or how little of these foods may be able to optimize heart rate variability and in the next slide resting heart rate so what's significantly associated with higher hrv and in this case we can see monounsaturated fatty acids omega-6 and protein intake now how much additional variants in hiv do they explain now it may not seem like much as protein for example seems to contribute or contributes the most uh explanatory um you know 2.5 percent uh in addition it explains an additional 2.5 in addition to the 5.7 that daily exertion and calorie intake explained in hrv and then relatively smaller amounts is explained by the addition of by the association for omega-6 and monounsaturated fatty acids all right so then in terms of nutrients that were associated with lower hrv fructose higher fructose lower hrv saturated fatty acids higher saturated fatty acids lower hiv and then also higher fiber lower hrv and in terms of how much additional uh um a percentage of the variance in hiv that they explain the strongest negative uh you know strongest contributor was fiber explaining an additional 2.1 percent bringing the total for that model up to 7.8 percent and then with lesser amounts for saturated fatty acids 1. 1.1 and fructose so 0.8 and also note that although non-fructose carbohydrates were very close to statistical significance 0.06 it's technically not statistically significant and then omega-3 intake is not statistically uh significantly associated with hrv so that that summarizes the data that i just presented with which then raises the interesting question can diet be personalized can this diet be personalized to optimize next day heart rate variability after a workout so when considering my average daily intake data uh assuming for a typical amount of calories on a workout day uh and looking at my average daily intake for each of these blue and uh sorry green and red macronutrients this suggests that eating more than 20 grams per day of monounsaturated fatty acids more than 11 grams per day of omega-6 more than 120 grams of protein but then correspondingly less than 79 grams per day for fructose less than 38 grams per day for saturated fatty acids and less than 91 grams per day for fiber may optimize my next hrv and i intend on uh you know following this path and then reevaluating my data at a future point to see if it actually uh is still strongly or significantly correlated with hrv all right so what about the data for resting heart rate and as you can see by the title there are weaker but statistically significant associations for these dietary components with resting heart rate so note that whereas the combination of daily exertion and calorie intake accounted for 5.7 of the variance explained in heart rate variability which is relatively small now those two variables explain a much larger amount of the variance in resting heart rate 44.4 all right so what's significantly associated with a lower resting heart rate so going in the right direction and again we can see a higher monounsaturated fatty acids and higher omega-6 is correlated associated after adjusting for daily exertion and calorie intake or associated with lower hrv and they were also associated with high sorry lower resting heart rate and they were also associated with higher hrv and then in terms of the percentage uh that is explained by these um macronutrients relative to the base model note that these are relatively smaller effects with the exception of monounsaturated fatty acids as it explains an additional 1.3 percent of the variance in resting heart rate but then relatively smaller effects are omega-6 0.3 percent you know compared to the to the macronutrient associations for heart rate variability these are relatively smaller explanations additional explanations in resting resting heart rate all right so in terms of the nutrients that are associated with higher resting heart rates so carbohydrate intake whether non-fructose fructose and then also higher fibers associated with higher resting heart rate and in terms of how much they explain the additional uh amount of the variance explained in resting heart rate again we can see relatively small amounts uh 0.4 percent for either of the two carbohydrate divisions and only 0.2 additionally explained for fiber now uh also note that omega-3 saturated fatty acids and protein were not significantly associated with resting heart rate now this this diet you know having relatively high levels of amofa and omega-6 but lower carbohydrate and potential and fiber intake this would suggest that i could potentially increase my heart rate variability and resting heart rate to a much lesser degree but it will optimizing or getting as much bang for my butt through diet and its impact on cardiovascular related metrics is that good for the my overall systemic health in terms of uh big picture biomarkers that i presented in other videos in other words do i optimize cv metrics but then make the net effect worse on my overall health so i haven't investigated that once i do that analysis i'll present that data in another video so stay tuned for that data all right if you're interested in more
