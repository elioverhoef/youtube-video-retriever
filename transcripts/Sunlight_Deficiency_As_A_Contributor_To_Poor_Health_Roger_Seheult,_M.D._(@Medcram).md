## Transcript

Hey everyone today's guest is dr roger schwell dr schel is currently an associate clinical professor at the uc riverside school of medicine and an assistant clinical professor at the school of medicine and allied health at lomma linda university dr schel is quadruple board certified in internal medicine pul pulmonary diseases critical care medicine and sleep medicine through the american board of internal medicine he's also the creative voice behind the popular youtube channel medcram and for those who don't don't already know i'll link to his channel in the video description so with that welcome roger and let's get into the presentation hey thank you so much michael it's a pleasure to be here and something really that's passionate for me is this understanding of light and what it can do to disease i'm actually more and more surprised about some of the things that we're seeing we'll get into that today we'll get into the science of it and then i'll show some case presentations as well so this actually is a lobby of a hospital in india where they're actually constructing hospitals now to allow more natural light in and it's because of the data that's coming out and i think we may be a little bit behind the world in terms of this and i'll explain why that's the case longevity which is what we all want is uh hampered and specifically the enemy of longevity is chronic disease and we've seen this actually for quite some time now um things like heart disease diabetes obesity dementia inflammation long covid cancer all of these diseases really are things that if if you were to get it it would sink your chances of having a long and fruitful life interestingly all of these things have in common one thing and that is mitochondrial dysfunction and this goes along with the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction is the central core of the aging process so as we get older our mitochondria make less atp atp is the fuel that allows your cells to be animated and as we get older these batteries in our cells make less energy and that is presumably a lot of what we see as we get older so heart disease diabetes obesity all of these things are a result of our not being able to metabolism very well so if you think of the mitochondria as a engine in your in your car for instance which gives you local motion it makes your car go but it also generates heat in the process of doing that and the process of doing that that heat can actually make the engine less efficient and actually kind of shut it down so the mitochondria uses fuel it uses you know proteins uh fats uh glucose things of that nature and it makes atp so this is really important about what it is that's going on because it also makes carbon dioxide and energy so this is really important as you're young and these things are working really well as you get older they don't work as well you don't make as much atp and and that's the big problem so just like the engine has heat in your car that you have to deal with with a cooling system the mitochondria also makes something called oxidative stress that is the heat that is the the situation that is the oxidative stress that can shut down the mitochondria and make it less efficient and that's what happens as we get older so we're finding out that uh the science shows that melatonin which is a very powerful antioxidant probably one of the most powerful antioxidants known to man can actually mop up this oxidative stress and keep your mitochondria functioning well it's kind of like the cooling system of your engine this is the the melatonin for your mitochondria now you may think oh melatonin that's the thing that is secreted from the pineal gland that's what we do when we sleep that gives us great sleep you're right that is true but in fact a lot more melatonin is produced in the mitochondria this is a paper that was published um and i'll show you this in a second in 2019 that shows that there's way more mit way more melatonin that's produced in the mitochondria that is produced in the pineal gland and here's the point the point is is that we're now starting to show now starting to understand that there is a substance which is absolutely free which is does not require a supply chain which can actually increase production of melatonin in your mitochondria in your cells and what is that as it turns out as you may have figured out by now it is actually sunlight so sunlight actually improves that now let let me explain sunlight is made up of many different types of wavelengths the majority of the photons from the sun are actually made up of something called near infrared radiation so let's take a look at that paper russell ryder scott zimmerman published this in 2019 in m melatonin research and this is an excerpt from that paper they say now that it's now been shown that the mitochondria produce melatonin in cells in quantities which are orders of magnitude higher and that are produced in the pineal gland this subcellular melatonin does not necessarily fluctuate with our circadian clock or release into the circulation system but instead has been proposed to be consumed locally in response to free radical density within each cell in particular in response to near infrared light exposure so look at that the the pineal gland less than 5% mitochondria all throughout the body greater than 95% this is really the lineon share of where it's coming from so if you want to understand near infrared light you've got to understand a couple of things it's it's outside of our visible spectrum it's beyond red you can't see it with the naked eye yet you can feel it with the human body it's that warmth that you feel when you go outside in the sun and more specifically it can penetrate through your clothes it can penetrate through your skin go deep within the body and actually interact with the mitochondria in your in your body um this is something that uh is well-known it is a well-known characteristic of energy that has a low frequency you may have noticed this when you are listening to an electrical storm and it's very far away the first sounds that you hear are low frequency sounds you know when you pull up to a stop sign and that car pulls up next to you and they're playing that really loud music all you hear is the the low frequency boom boom boom that's because that's the only energy that can really penetrate through their car your car and vibrate the steering wheel the the point here is that low frequency energy like infrared light can penetrate very deeply this is a picture of dr robert furry's hand he's a astrophysicist that works at the european space agency worked on the hubble telescope work with nasa and he's putting his hand in front of a n infrared light source and picking it up with a near infrared camera and as you can see the light is going literally right through his hand you cannot see bones because it's going through the bones the only thing that's actually blocking it are the blood vessels and that's because water absorbs infrared light that's why that infrared light when it goes into your body it's going to scatter all throughout your body and then get picked up by these weak absorbers that are specifically in the mitochondria and there's an amazing work that happens there in the mitochondria when that near infrared light goes through uh as you can see here the longer the wavelength the lower the frequency to the right now on this side the deeper that this light is going to penetrate into the human body here's another paper uh this is from scott zimmerman and russell ryder in 2019 again looking at how deep does this infrared light actually penetrate down and it scatters right so it's not just like how deep does it penetrate but it's also how long does it take for it to scatter and then finally get absorbed by a weak absorber inside the body 8 cm that that's a huge distance that this is able to penetrate down with just regular 900 nanometer infrared light so this is a study that was done looking at the clothes that we wear and whether infrared light can penetrate through that you can see here many different types of materials and here's the point on the xaxis we have the number of layers of fabric notice that we're getting up to like 13 here before we start to see any kind of diminu of the amount of energy from their infrared like nobody wears 13 layers of clothing usually it's one or two and you can see here very clearly that you're going to be getting at at least 50% of the infrared light that's coming to you from the human from the sun to your body even if you're wearing one or two layers of any type of clothing the other aspect of infrared light that's really interesting is that trees are highly reflective of infrared light not just trees grass leaves anything that's green and so if you go outside hoping to get infrared light you're going to get it but you're going to get two three four times more if you're in a green environment because it's going to be coming to you from all angles and you're going to be just lit up with infrared light you don't see it you just see green leaves this is going beyond that and you're seeing this infrared light now infrared light is something that carries heat along with it you experience this heat and one of the ways that you know that this is true is when you go up to the trees and feel the leaves even on a hot day hot sunny day those leaves are never hot they reflect that light very well in fact the coolest place in a garden is underneath that tree because those leaves are reflecting away that very hot infrared light so to review near infrared light coming into our body whether it's outside whether we're in a garden whether it's green trees it's going to penetrate deeply through that skin bounce around it's going to interact with our mitochondria to reduce oxidative stress increase atp production increase carbon dioxide production and as a result it's going to use up fuel and so your glucose levels are going to drop so you're probably saying at this point okay what's the evidence for this well glen jeffrey university college london published this couple actually this year um showing that in in uh subjects that were given randomized red light this was 670 nanometer light those that were given a 75 g bolus of glucose had a had a low had a smaller increase in blood glucose than those that didn't in other words the blood glucose was reduced because the mitochondria were so energized that they were using up the fuel and they were producing more energy in the situation and more carbon dioxide they actually confirm that by measuring the exhaled carbon dioxide in these subjects and sure enough those that had the red light had higher exhaled carbon dioxide levels so this has obviously huge implications when we're talking about diabetes and and glucose sorts of things here's actually the study you can see here um those obviously the six the uh 75 grams of glucose made the blood glucose go up those in red were getting the red light those in gray were not getting the the the red light and over here on the right hand side you can see those that were getting the red light had higher levels of exhaled carbon dioxide so proof of concept physiology at the human level it's actually working so let's look and blow it up to the epidemiological levels here here's a study that was done out of oxford where they took blood tests on patients they just drew blood and checked them for triglycerides and insulin sensitivity and what they did was they looked at the previous s days prior to that blood draw and they asked themselves in the weather report how many hours of sunlight were there and you know what they found they found that the more hours of sunlight that there were before the blood draw was done not temperature but sunlight that correlated to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced triglycerides again suggesting that more sunlight has an effect on the human body even within a few days all right what about over years and and what about survival so this was a study that was done in southern sweden published about 8 years ago in 2016 and they took 30,000 swedish women and asked them hey do you avoid the sun do you go out into the sun do you avidly go out into the sun divided them up into those three groups and what did they find they found that those that avoided the sun had higher total mortality rates higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates higher cancer mortality rates and higher non-cardiovascular disease and that the more sunlight that they actually went with the lower the absolute all cause mortality got not just all cause mortality cardiovascular disease uh mortality cancer disease mortality and non-cardiovascular disease mortality now this is an associative study so they say oh you really can't say causation but i would i would look at this mike and that is that that there was a dose response curve here which means uh that this is highly suggestive of a uh of a causal relationship in fact the magnitude of sunlight in the study was so large that nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group it it makes you wonder now that when we have people that go outside to smoke okay what are we doing we're having them go outside this could actually be the best thing for them because the smoking is offset by the sunlight in in this type of thing obviously maybe 20 minutes 15 minutes is is not enough maybe it needs more all right and by the way that study was replicated in a recent uh texas study that looked at um sorry a uk biobank study that looked at 10 times the amount of of uh people so not just women not just 30,000 but men and women 300,000 in the uk biobank study and you know what they found exactly the same results people who were outside in the sun more had reduction in all cause mortality in uh in cardiovascular disease mortality and yes cancer mortality we're concerned that if we go out into the sun we're going to have more melanoma more basil cell carcinoma more scram cell carcinoma but in fact the data shows that there's actually a reduction in all cancer mortality so here's another uh study that looked at this here we're looking at satellite data at night okay so light in the day is good what about light at night is that good or is that bad and the studies have shown that it's bad it's based on studies that looked at satellite data and where people were living um this is the uh the type of of data that they're looking at in china to see where people are dying and how close are they to night light uh there was this study that was published in the proceeds of the national academy of sciences titled brighter nights and darker days predict higher mortality risk this was a texas study that looked at 88,000 individuals uk biobank but they were not looking at satellite data they were actually wearing a device that was measuring light at all hours of the day uh this is about 88,000 89,000 they followed them for eight years this is amazing what they found so they looked at model one and uh let me see here yeah model one where they looked at the time of day here on the x-axis so 16 that's about 4:00 in the afternoon to 4:00 in the afternoon and they asked this question compared to people who get 50th percentile of light exposure and less what would happen to mortality for people that were in the 50th to 70th percentile that's here in blue at the bottom people in the 70th to 90th percentile that's in purple here in the middle and people who got the highest amounts of light 90th to 100 percentile and that's here in red notice first of all what happens as we go from 50th to 70th 70th to 90th and 90th to 100 do you notice what happens the amplitude of this effect gets bigger and bigger what does that suggest dose response curve again it implies causation in the uh bradford hill criteria okay what else do you notice notice that sunlight at all hours of the day reduces mortality except for from about midnight to about 7:00 in the morning so having bright light from midnight to about 7 o'clock in the morning is not a good thing in fact this thing stops to become beneficial at around 9:00 at night and you can see that works in all cause mortality cardiometabolic activity and other cause mortality same sort of situation we're seeing that light during the day is beneficial light at night is not beneficial okay and this is the uh findings they said these findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining a dark environment across late night and early morning hours when the central circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to light and seeking bright light during the day to enhance circadian rhythms protection of lighting environments may be especially important in those at risk for both circadian disruption and mortality such as in intensive care units or aged care settings across the general population avoiding nightl and seeking daylight may lead to a reduction in disease burden especially cardio metabolic diseases and may increase longevity michael this is exactly the same diseases that we're talking about at the beginning when we're talking about the mitochondrian we're actually connecting these dots let's connect it even more we said that trees and grass grass and leaves highly reflective of infrared light what do we see when people go out into these spaces we have known for decades that people who live in green spaces have better outcomes notice this 28% reduction in diabetes type 2 16% reduction in cardiovascular mortality 31% reduction in total mortality and uh you know people say well look hey these people who live in green spaces they have more money they have more status they can exercise more this is the reason why they have better mortality well i got a i got a um i got a a study for you south louisville kentucky four square mile area they measured crp levels which is a surrogate for cardiovascular disease and then they went and planted 8,000 trees mature trees with leaves already on them that's all they did they just planted trees now according to what we've talked about today that would improve and increase infrared light especially when you go outside that should have beneficial effects just by itself without exercising obviously we didn't inject money into their bank accounts we didn't do anything else we just planted the trees and then 2 to three years later we measured crp levels again there was a mind-blowing reduction of crp in that po in the same population by 133% that may not sound like a lot but that's about the equivalent that you would get with uh exercise regular exercise three times a week so that's mindblowing what did this study of meta analysis of everybody who gets outside into green spaces find well let me tell you what they found they said that we found that spending time in or living close to natural green spaces is associated with diverse and significant health benefits it reduces the risk of now listen to these diseases see if they sound familiar type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease premature death pre-term birth and increases sleep duration people living closer to nature also had reduced diastolic blood pressure heart rate and stress in fact one of the really interesting things that we found is that exposure to green space significantly reduces people's levels of salivary cortisol a physiological marker of stress all right so with all of this evidence right all of this evidence we took you we looked at individual physiological evidence with glenn jeff's lab and he's got a whole bunch more tests and studies that we could talk about then we talked about the epidemiological test and we just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and showing these things you would think at this point that there would be something from the dermatological literature saying hey you know we don't agree with you well in fact there's a uk dermatologist who published in a very large dermatological paper uh entitled the uh the journal of investigative dermatology published just this august in 2024 titled sunlight time for a rethink and this is what he says basically hey he says hey look there's a number of organizations that have just both produced position statements recognizing that sunlight has beneficial effects that should be considered in formulating policy on sunlight exposure and highlighting the necessity of carrying out further research into these beneficial effects we should take note so in fact even the dermatologists are recognizing that there are benefits with sunlight exposure i took note i'll tell you there were a lot of questions that i had because i'm a pulmonary and critical care physician i worked at the intensive care unit i took care of patients and i had a lot of questions in the last four or five years when i saw these covid patients coming in one of the first questions i had had to do with why these patients that were coming in all had these metabolic disorders because we were told initially at the beginning that the patients that we were going to be seeing in the intensive care unit were should be respiratory patients because this was a respiratory virus and and while we did have patients with copd we did have patients with asthma that was by far and large not the people that we saw we saw the people that we talked about at the beginning the people with mitochondrial dis function and i began to ask myself why is that the case so if we go back and look at the mitochondria which we said the big problem there is oxidative stress one of the things that we need to look at and understand is that the a2 receptor is not just a receptor for the sars k2 virus in fact the a2 receptor is is much more than that it's actually the modulator of guess what oxidative stress and so when the virus was spreading around all throughout the country the world what was happen happening is that we were knocking out the a2 receptor in the entire population now some of our cars if you will were operating a little bit hot some of our cars were not operating as hot maybe they were they were in a better situation but you can imagine that this was like a stress test getting sars k2 infection was knocking out that ace2 uh modulator of oxidative stress and for some of us that was going up a hill called covid-19 and for those of us that had hot engines already where cooling systems were not working well we didn't have a lot of melatonin we didn't have a lot of antioxidants we had oxidative stress that was enough to shut down the engine for it to overheat and the people that we saw that in were exactly the same people michael that we talked about at the beginning of this presentation heart disease diabetes obesity dementia inflammation and cancer these were exactly the same people that i was seeing in my intensive care unit that were not doing well but i said there i had a couple of questions here was the other question question that i had we knew very early on that people that were coming into the intensive care unit had vitamin d levels those that had high vitamin d levels or normal vitamin d levels did very well those that had low vitamin d levels did not do well now we know that correlation does not necessarily mean causation but what we decided to do because it was very low risk was to supplement these people with oral vitamin d and you know there were some studies that seemed to show that it may have helped out but there were other studies plenty of those studies that did not show any benefit whatsoever so i began to wonder whether or not vitamin d was helping a little bit but was more of a marker of something else that they were getting that was helping them out and of course the way that you get vitamin d levels elevated is to go out into the sun so i began to wonder whether or not in fact people with high vitamin d levels were doing well not just because they had high vitamin d levels from a fraction of the sunlight which is uvb exposure but in fact from the rest of the 53% of the photons from the sun that are in the infrared spectrum that we've already shown improves melatonin in the intra cellular area in the mitochondria and of course that's a very powerful antioxidant and of course if covid-19 is a oxidative stress disease this could have very huge implications so i began to look at data and here we look at the data here this is paper that was published in january of 2021 in scientific reports and what they did here was they looked at the surges of covid-19 in the autumn of 2020 so as the sun started to come down in the northern hemisphere and start to drop into the southern hemisphere certain countries started to get picked off one by one and we started to see one by one that these countries were having surges starting first with finland ending up last with greece so this did not correlate with temperature this did not correlate with humidity what it correlated was with latitude 100% perfect correlation then i began to think okay maybe there's something here to this sunlight question then there was another study that was published in april of 2021 in epidemiology again looking at this time not the amount of covid happening but the mortality of covid happening and what they found was that sure enough in not only the united states but also in england and again in italy prospectively they found basically that the more sunlight there was the lower the covid-19 mortality was in that area and they publish this in fact they said it suggests that optimizing sun exposure may be a possible public health intervention given that the effect appears independent of a vitamin d pathway it suggests possible new covid-19 therapies that was amazing so i took that opportunity to look and i actually teamed up with margaret scutch who is a geographist and she looked at the the global uh situation and we looked at countries that had a greater than 50% overweight rate uh rate and we asked the question does covid-19 correlate with latitude of these countries generally speaking and the answer was absolutely limiting countries to more than to to just the 50% of the population being overweight or higher there was a definite association we actually published that in june of 2022 in melatonin research but let me just back up a little bit here because it's not just co uh truth be told here if you look at every single natural cause of death whether it be heart disease stroke chronic lower respiratory disease alzheimer's disease diabetes influenza kidney disease you name it anything that goes on the death certificate from a natural cause look here michael look at look at this very carefully they all peak right at the end of the year so literally just weeks after the shortest day of the year every single year it's just incredible and it's not just heart disease it's all of them so it's not just a situation where you say okay well maybe we're all going inside because it's cold and we're spreading the germs around okay i could understand that maybe for an infectious disease but heart disease kidney disease these are not infectious diseases right these are all peing at that period in that time of year here's another way of looking at it by the way if i if i uh were to to show you australia's version of this chart and i don't have it with me at the moment but if i were to show you australia's version of this chart it shifted 6 months so it's still happening about a week or so after the shortest day of the year but their shortest day of the year is in july right because doing the sou southern hemisphere by the way the coldest month in australia is july yet the average highs in july is like in the mid-60s in australia so it's not even cold in december you can't use that as an excuse that everybody's going inside and putting on the heating and you're spreading around these viruses this has to do with the amount of sunlight that people are getting i am convinced so let's focus it on the flu again very clearly this flu deaths we can predict exactly when it's going to happen and it always happens every year just a few weeks after the shortest day of the year and we've already shown you that sunlight can have an effect on the human body literally within days so that changes very quickly um but don't take my word for it um let's look at the harvard kennedy school they did a study that looked at solar radiation data from the national solar radiation database and cdc data for influenza and they were able to actually look at 2009 which you may recall we had an epidemic of h1n1 that year that came in really early so like in july august september well before the normal flu season there was reduced sunlight across the country and it was in specific areas so we were able to actually look at this in terms of temperature in terms of humidity and in terms of sunlight and guess what the harvard kennedy school found they said quote we find that sunlight strongly protects against getting influenza so it's not a temperature or humidity thing all right so what is it that's actually happening why would sunlight be beneficial well this is a study that was published oh back in 2021 looking at infrared light therapy that's the majority of the photons coming from the sun barone what they do is it actually shows that it reduces toik receptor 4 dependent hyperinflammation you can see the data here on the right hand side it reduces il6 we have we actually have drug medications in fda approval that is supposed to do exactly that same thing for covid-19 guess what infrared light does the same thing it drops uh il6 whether it's coming from an led or an incandescent bulb it does exactly the same thing il8 same thing tumor necrosis factor alpha same thing interferon alpha and interferon beta are interferons which stimulate the humoral arm or the adaptive arm of the immune system this is exactly what is ramping up after 7even days of covid-19 and you're getting that cyto kind storm getting into the intensive care unit and getting intubated this is what we want to reduce as opposed to the gamma interferon which is more cell meated which is where it actually breaks down cells that are already infected and guess what chronic exposure to natural sunlight actually has the opposite effect of that that's that's why this is so beneficial getting out into the sunlight when you come down with an infection is going to help clear up the virus and it's going to mitigate reduce attenuate that humoral response on day seven so so impressive but you're saying here probably at this point michael you're saying okay this is a lot of circumstantial data that seems to suggest it what we really need is a randomized placebo controlled trial that actually takes patients with this disease gives some of them randomly infrared light and some of them placebo well i've got that study here for you published in a very top photobiomodulation journal 95 percentile in terms of impact factor published in january of 2023 by pereira at all they did a uh very carefully conducted uh inclusion criteria 30 inpatients between the ages of 50 and 80 with a diagnosis of covid-19 bmi of less than 30 no cancer no photosensitivity not intubated but sick enough to actually be admitted to the hospital and they did a very simple experiment they actually made a jacket with infrared light leds that of course are broadcasting in a light that you can't see so it's blinded by definition and it was at 940 nanometers and they did this for just 15 minutes a day just 15 minutes a day that was it for seven days and they asked the question what happened well actually the randomization of those two groups was a little bit off but it actually turned out that the people in the intervention group the near infrared group were actually slightly sicker than those that were in the control group so the randomization actually was biased against the intervention group nevertheless what happened in the n group oxygen saturation improved higher and faster than the control group those patients were able to take deeper and stronger breaths after those seven days the respirat rate and the heart rate improved faster than in the control group the lymphocytes which are extremely important in getting rid of cells that are infected with the virus instead of in the control group where they continued to drop down because the virus were infecting them there was actually a an increase of 850 um cells per cubic uh millimeter but here's the most mindblowing statistic here in terms of endpoints people who got near infrared light for just 15 minutes a day were discharged a full four days faster than those in the control group i don't have to tell you that has huge implications in terms of the finances and hospitals actually on the positive so many hospitals uh what they'll do is when they have a patient that gets admitted with a specific diagnosis the insurance company will pay a block sum for that diagnosis and it's up to the hospital to get that patient quicker faster better and out the door so they can take the profits on that whatever was given to them and not have the expenses of a patient taking up a hospital bed and having a nurse so that's called a drg there's also something called subc capitation or capitation where the hospital is paid per member per month so i don't have to tell you that if if we can somehow get patients better faster and out the door that has huge implications in terms of finances just to give you an idea tlu which was fda approved for influenza was fda approved on the basis of ending the symptoms of influenza 24 hours faster we're talking four times that amount here with just natural well not natural sunlight but infrared light which is in natural sunlight so when i learned this michael i have to tell you that i was convinced i was treating patients during the bulk of the of the pandemic uh in the icu phase with vitamin d thinking i was doing them favors when i started to learn this by that point many of the patients coming into the hospital were no longer requiring you care and i vowed that if i ever had another patient like that i would try it out on them well about a year ago in about october of 2023 i had a patient that was admitted to the hospital for two days with covid and despite the fact that he was on solumedrol aiit and some of these things that we treat the patients with basically the standard of care for those two days he went from four liters of oxygen nasal canula to 10 liters oxymizer finally they called me when he was on 35 l 100% f2 and almost ready to be intubated i went down to his hospital room opened the door after i gowned up and put a mask on and found this guy in the dark with the window closed and his daughter he was depressed he wanted to know how much time he had i immediately felt the urge to get him outside talked to our respiratory therapist talked to our charge nurse they put their heads together put oxygen tanks together and got him into a wheel cherry he didn't really want to do it we had to convince him to do it but but we did it for about 20 to 30 minutes every day i got him out into the sunlight the next day he was down to 15 l oxymizer then 10 then 6 l nasal canula then four and then by day 19 he was discharged from the hospital without the need of any oxygen this is a picture of that first day that we took him outside you can see that we've got a nice little garden in our hospital that's got nice green plants that are highly reflective of infrared light we have some trees it's in a private area in the hospital so that people from the outside can't look in this is his daughter here on the left the respiratory therapist kim my charge nurse peter i had permission from the uh from the patient to take this picture i could he i could have taken it from the front i just didn't want to do that uh so i took it from the back to give him some privacy but uh he he did he did very well you know what he told me about two weeks later he said you know that first day that you got me out there dr schwell that sun felt so good so good i thought i had a new treatment for covid-19 michael i thought this is it we've discovered something new but to quote a very wise king from the from the old testament there is nothing new under the sun pun intended uh 100 years ago there was a a lady by the name of florence nightingale who's actually the founder of modern nursing she gave up uh a very rich um family uh lifestyle and she decided to go into nursing that was not something that young women did if they could choose not to do it and you know she she took care of of british soldiers during the crimean war she was known as the lady with the lamp she visited them she was there at the bedside this is what she said in terms of what helped she says of all the remedies that i've used or seen in use i can find but one thing that i can call remedial for the whole disease and that is a profuse supply of fresh air second only to fresh air however i should be inclined to rank light in importance of the sick for the sick direct sunlight not only daylight is necessary for a speedy recovery you know not just uh florence nightingale on the on the european continent but also here in the united states there was a health reformer actually the the former um actually the founder of loma linda university where i hail from ellen g white this is what she said in 1871 she says the feeble one should press out into the sunshine as earnestly and naturally as do the shaded plants and vines the pale and sickly grain blade that has struggled up out of the cold of early spring puts out the natural and healthy deep green after enjoying for a few days the health and life-giving raise of the the sun go out into the light and warmth of the glorious sun you pale and sickly ones and share with vegetation its life dealing health giving power you know the other thing that she said that i found it really interesting based on that study that we looked at with light and not having light on at night they could see this as well she says make it a habit not to sit up after 9:00 every light should be extinguished this turning of night into day is a wretched health destroying habit and sure enough this is exactly what they did they practice what they preach as you can see here michael they they had they had hospitals that were specifically designed to get patients outside into the sun you can see the doors and the beds are of exactly the right dimensions so that the doors are not blocked the the uh the patio here is the right length to store them this was built in to the architecture of getting people better in these hospitals in these sanitariums here we see girl postoperative uh getting uh sunlight for their for their uh ills and the the roof of the hospitals had beds out there for patients this is something that we did uh something that was very effective and we could see it even without the scientific accoutrements that we have today well what about the data that we see well you know one thing that's really important for hospitals is getting good surveys and there's a lot of data on this people who are in uh rooms that are next to the window get better faster this was a study that looked at this and they found that researchers have found that a patient's hospital room might affect their outcomes after surgery for example having a window in their room was associated with a faster recovery after surgery um what about these cap g scores these are really important and in every situation whether you're talking about windows or no windows the presence of windows the view to a window the view of the content in that window whether there's green spaces in all of these situ sitations when the patients fill out the survey for their experience in the hospital it's always improved whenever these things are involved you can see window size more windows so look this is something that is this is the the best situation you could possibly have this is something that is generally free you don't need a supply chain it helps the patients it can help the hospital financially and uh you get better scores there's really no downside to it i mean in terms of relieving stress all the way down the line every single situation we're seeing better scores in patients who are having that in the hospital all right last thing i want to talk to you about is a is a case study that i found just absolutely astounding and and really told me and educated me on how powerful this effect could possibly be so this is a lady that called me up a couple of weeks ago um and she doesn't mind me telling the story she gave me permission to tell the story in fact she gave me the ct scans which i'm going to show you her 15-year-old uh son was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of b cell lymphocytic uh lymphoma back in september of last year in 2023 started chemo right away and in may of the next year developed a pneumonia he had two to three weeks of cough runny nose went into the hospital with neutropenic fever this is a very uh common situation where the chemotherapy knocks out the immune system it knocks down your nutrifil you develop a fever the typical thing is you go into the hospital you get antibiotics you get better you're discharged that's not what happened here unfortunately he developed a pretty strong infection in the left lung turned out to be a flesh eating mucor micosis or flesh eaing fungus so he was immediately put on very very powerful antifungals and had a bronchoscopy it showed that it was getting worse he had chest tubes finally they came to the unfortunate conclusion that the only way to save his life was to remove that left lung which he had done and uh soon after that that was in uh july so already been in the hospital for a month inside a hospital no sunlight no natural light under the led bulbs the in the uh fluorescent bulbs the windows that blocked out infrared light just basically in this hospital unfortunately after that lung was taken out that did not solve the problem because the fungus spread to the right lung and uh it showed that he was getting worse his oxygen requirements were getting worse and about 6 weeks after admission to the hospital the unfortunate conclusion of all of this was was that he was not getting better and they were concerned that he was going to need to be intubated on a ventilator and if he was if that was going to happen there was no way he was going to get off so i show you here different cuts through his uh chest you can see here that the left lung here on this side is actually on the right side of the screen it's all white because there is no lung there it's just filled up with fluid the top one here is the top uh uh slice through the top portion of the lung you can see here that the right lung is is very white and inflamed uh that is what it was looking like you can see here in the middle portion of the lung same situation there was a little bit of sparing in the lower portion of the right lung where you see more black that's what it should look like because the lung should be filled with air so there was a multi-disciplinary care conference they looked it over everything we're talking about the oncologist we're talking about the thoracic surgeon there was nothing further they could offer the patient bronchoscopy thoracentesis these are procedures which would just sort of rearrange the chairs on this sinking ship uh they basically had to come to the family and it was a very emotional decision but basically they had to tell this guy this 15-year-old boy who was completely with it completely understand everything that was going on that he was about to die that he had about probably two days left to live uh because of the progression of this disease so and i can tell you as a as a health care provider in that kind of situation you feel horrible and you're willing to do anything that that person that that patient wants he's about to die you're look you're looking at a dead man basically basically and if he asks for something you're going to do everything that you possibly can do for him in this case he expressed a desire on july 16th which is when the scan was done to just go outside he just wanted to go outside because he liked going outside now at this point i should tell you that uh there was a device that the family had been told about during this called a firefly device which gives off light in not only the ultraviolet spectrum but also the infrared spectrum and they had tried it occasionally um off and on during this six weeks while he was in the hospital obviously didn't have much benefit but what they decided to do on 717 because he made this desire it was not easy to do they had to again put tanks together get a bipat machine which he was already on very high 100% oxygen to get him outside it wasn't easy but he was outside on 7:17 from 2: to 600 p.m. He was out there for about 4 hours he had a fever that day and the white blood cell count was very elevated at 20 7.5 most of those were nutrifil it was fighting the infection next day went out for another about 4 and 1 half hours and they tried the firefly at that point which is that device i just showed you just for five minutes three times a day plus he was outside at that point the fever had disappeared the wi blet cell count had come down precipitously to 18.0 neutr is down to 13.7 two days had come and gone he wasn't dead went outside again this time for about an hour firefly again for about 5 minutes three times a day fever completely gone white blood cell count continues to drop precipitously for to the neutrophils down to 4.8 on 720 the physician team started to scratch their head what was going on his oxygen requirements were coming down throughout this period of time he was actually looking better he was outside for another 3 and 1 half hours again firefly 5 minutes three times a day fever completely gone oxygen requirements went down at this point they said hey maybe we were wrong about something if we can if he looks better and the and the antibiotics are working then maybe we could try getting him back on chemotherapy i want to show you what happened when they got another cat scan to see how he was doing so again i put up here the three representative ct scans of what happened on the 16th of july and how involved these were and after just four to 5 days of getting outside into the sunlight and also using firefly device so i can't tell you which one it was um but i believe it was probably both just the sunlight look at the difference look at the difference between the circles circles on the left are exactly at the same place in the lung as a circle on the right and you can see a dramatic improvement in the inflammation so when i look at this i think about that study with the toll like receptor 4 well i think about melatonin i think about reducing all of the cyto kindes i think about boosting the immune system i think about the lymphocytes that went up in that study in that randomized controlled study and uh i can't help but think wow this guy asked to go outside imagine if he'd asked just to play a few video games uh he might not be with us and the fact of the matter is is that he continued to get better and this was in july of this year in 20124 and was able to be discharged home still battling the acute lymphocytic leukemia still getting the chemotherapy for that but no longer an issue with mucor micosis in fact this is the lung ct that was done last month and i just decided to do one shot because it looks like this all throughout the entire lung it is completely gone there is no sign whatsoever of this fungal infection in this patient hard to believe but incredible that the sun would actually have that much power began to make me think about how little time we spend in the sun you know um i can't help but think what uh ellen g white wrote when she founded lomol linda university which is where i uh graduated from and she said this is what she said i i just putting all this together and how powerful this is she says i have a decided message for our people in southern california this is where i work for months i've carried on my soul the burden of medical missionary work in southern california recently much light has been given me in regards to the manner in which god desires us to conduct sanitarium work we are to encourage the patient to spend much of their time outdoors that is just incredible to me um and and i'll tell you why i think that we need to be getting intentional sunlight getting outside for 20 to 30 minutes per day especially in the winter time when it's the hardest to do it when the sun gets up after we go to work and the sun goes down before we get home yeah it's hard to do but i believe that that's the most essential time to do it and let me explain why we spend 93 % of our lives inside we are not able to get that infrared light because we're not outside to get it it cannot penetrate through the walls the lights that we now have in our homes are not incandescent lights that give off infrared light they're led bulbs that have had specifically that portion of the spectrum cut out of them in the name of energy efficiency same thing with the windows in our modern buildings they are blocking infrared light from coming in because it heats up the building and it causes air conditioning costs and i can't help but think that this may be the reason why we have an increase in chronic disease so we need an impatient heliotherapy protocol i'm actually trying to work on getting that done in some of our hospitals where i work um it' be nice to be able to select those types of things in our patients say yes i want this patient to go outside uh we would need an army of volunteers in the community to do that we'd have to watch them very carefully because obviously it's not easy to transport patient that are critical you have to make sure that if something happens to them that you're ready to take care of that but think about what it could do the length of stay think about finances what it could do with in terms of the beds that we have to take care of patients if they're leaving the hospital faster now we have more beds to take care of patients that are coming in so we will end this presentation where we started it and you will see why i'm so passionate about this because i want everyone to have longevity i want everyone to live as long and as healthy as they possibly can the problem is is that chronic disease is the enemy of longevity and we know that chronic disease is everywhere so the next time you see or come face to face with chronic disease i want you to look it straight in the eye and say let's take this fight outside that was great that was great thanks roger uh so i guess we'll take it off full screen and then questions yeah i'm open to questions yeah all right so uh i think so there's obviously a u-shaped curve with sunlight and health right too little you get goes up to you and well the argument could be made how much is too much right even though people who were uh not sun of void or you know so uh people who avoided the sun had it increased all cause mortality risk you could make the argument that uh too much sun exposure photoaging you know accelerated skin aging so there might be some you know you're going up the u right so you mentioned 20 to 30 minutes how can we get towards a more precise dose or is how can we get to yeah a more precise dose or is that the mo most precise dose for uh getting you know minimizing risk and yeah good question so we have we've got two extreme opposites not just in terms of the u but in terms of the types of data that we have so we have epidemiological data that's really robust that shows not only in the southern sweden study but also in the uk biobank study that we have not yet reached the limit of sunlight exposure and improvement in longevity it wasn't like we saw a bell-shaped curve in those epidemiological studies right the ones that were exposed to sun the most had the best um had the best uh um longevity but we know that we don't want people frying out in the sun right we kind of know that intuitively so the point there shortly is is i don't know where the upper limit of that is epidemiologically i think we need more data on that on the other flip side when you look at glenn jeffrey and his lab what he is finding out and he sees this not just in humans what he this phenomenon that i'm about to explain to you is not specific to just humans it's it's also seen in bees it's seen in fruit flies i mean it's seen up and down across species and that is this thing this thing thing called the basic response of light which is that it takes a certain amount of time for light to make its effect on the mitochondria and what he's seeing is about 15 to 20 minutes is what he sees and then further exposure to light after that has diminishing marginal utility so this is where i come up with i'm trying to marry these two things together and i'm trying to say uh that we don't need to be frying out in the sun every single day and certainly that's going to cause skin damage but perhaps maybe on a daily basis all it takes is for us to get out there for 20 to 30 minutes to get the effect that we need in the mitochondria and not acr the the detrimental effects of skin damage and and um you know all of this damage that we get from uv uv radiation so there was a couple of studies in terms of that where he took this was published about 2021 where he took people who had difficulty with their vision and it was it was because of they could not sense the difference between colors so what he was able to show was that when he exposed to to their eyes to red light 670 nmet light for just two to three minutes in the morning specifically it had to be in the morning he was able to show that for the next 3 to four days there was a dramatic improvement in visual acuity between colors now remember that the retina is the is is the tissue in the body with the highest concentration of mitochondria so that's where we would expect to see that that improvement but it seems as though just for some reason just a few minutes maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe longer it's hard to say and we obviously we need studies to look at that but the effect that he is seeing it's like almost a switch turns on after a certain amount of time it's not like this linear relationship and the effect can last for days which then goes to i think in one of one of your videos uh you mentioned like time of day too so could the dose at time of day be an important factor too i mean should we getting the sunlight near infrared and you know red photons or is it we want a combination of you know midday uv and the so what are your thoughts on that so it depends on the effect that we're looking for if we're looking for the effect of light on the circadian rhythm there's no question that time of day absolutely matters and it's because that the intrinsically photosens of retinal gangion cells which are in the lower portion of the retina are not as sensitive in the morning as they are in the evening so so it's much more important to avoid light you have to do a a really good job of avoiding light in the evening and you really have to do a tremendous job of getting light to the eyes in the morning time now if we're talking about infrared light going through the body and going into the mitochondria this is a situation where we're not dealing with intrinsically photosensitivity of retinal ganglion cells i don't know whether or not there is a circadian rhythm situation there it may just simply be that light needs to get into the mitochondria and has nothing to do with circadian rhythm but i'll tell you this before when we've made assumptions that something had nothing to do with circadian rhythm we've been wrong before so it might actually be involved even at that level though in terms of the circadian rhythm alignment with light exposure i think uh you also mentioned in one of your videos about uh cortisol the cortisol and melatonin link there so i guess not getting the morning light then there's going to be a rise in cortisol and then nighttime awakening be uh uh in the middle of the night and you're not setting the melatonin so could you just go through that because i think that's a brilliant uh yeah absolutely so cortisol is the hormone of the day at the beginning of the day and melatonin is the hormone of the beginning of the night and the way the way you really want those are in pulses so if you don't get morning sunlight that pulse of cortisol that you should be getting to get the body ready to go and tuned is going to be more delayed and you're not going to get the effect of that cortisol as much as if you got morning light and that peak of cortisol to start your day off in the morning it's like a cup of coffee uh literally i mean i've heard people talk about how they how it feels to them morning sunlight is it gives them the energy of a cup of coffee of course without the coffee um the same thing happens in the evening time except it's the lack of sunlight that does it it's the lack of artificial light that does this so not having light around 9:00 10:00 11:00 allows the this peak of melatonin to be able to occur from the pineal gland because it's not being shut down by the uh the light being shot into your eyes this also happens and so you really need both of these things that to be able to occur lack of light after 9:00 and bright shining light at 9:00 in the morning to allow that cortisol level for the day so if you can't get the sunlight in the morning like is as you said you know most of us are getting up before the sun comes up you know so then is it is it a red light panel is it a combined red near infrared panel or how how would you i don't think it needs to be a red light panel to get the cortisol um so any kind of light in fact uh you could even buy these on amazon for 20 bucks called a sad light or sad light this this type of light is going to hit the intrinsically photosensitive retino gangion cells which have their peak in the blue area but the light that's in front of you is white it's going to have plenty of that blue light that it needs uh and it's going to trigger that and cause two effects the first first effect is is going to set the circadian rhythm through the intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangan cell pathway the second is going to the perh habenular nucleus which is the nucleus of the brain that is uh implied with seasonal aective disorder so this is a disorder that typically affects uh people in the winter months a little bit more females than males and uh it can it has a there's a t you can basically eliminate seasonal affective disorder by bu a sad light putting it in front of you in the morning for about 20 minutes about 11 to 15 in from your eyes and it's usually about 10,000 lux which is the the brightness that you need to have so that would affect seasonal effective disorder you know in northern latitudes in the winter for you know for example but uh does that cover the full spectrum in terms of you know the red light and near infrared light aside from effects on no it wouldn't so this is circadian uh in general so what do we do when we want to get the infrared light that's really important and uh this s light is not going to be able to do that what you need to do is to get outside look even i was just in edmonton about a month ago and uh granted it's not the shortest day of the year yet i was still able to get outside i was still able to see that that sun even though it's low in the sky remember the near infrared light is able to penetrate even at that low level uh for those of you who live in cold weather climates you know that during the winter time one of the most dangerous things on the road is black ice how does black ice form it's very simple black ice forms when precipitation comes down in the form of snow and then the sun comes up and melts that snow and then at night it refreezes that's how you get black ice realize that the sun is actually melting the snow to get that black ice what portion of the sun is melting that snow it's infrared light so you have to actually get outside and get into the infrared light yes it's cold put on a couple of layers it should penetrate through but you need to get that infrared light okay let's say that there's no way you're able to get it even with my chiding you to do so what are other ways that people have gotten near infrared light in cold weather climates where the sun doesn't come up natural fires so fireplaces this black body radiation that comes out of the fire does actually give off a whole band of infrared light and near inf for red light fantastic all right so biomarkers of uh sunlight exposure being vitamin d you know uvb right so what about uh and granted in meta analyses there may not be an upper limit for uh circulating levels of vitamin d's association with all cause mortality risk for example just being higher than 30 nanograms per mill and at least one meta analysis from 2014 that i commonly sight uh it basically you know you see all cause mortality risk come down and and then basically flatline even at very high levels of circulating vitamin d which suggests that potentially sunlight even at very high amounts or megadosing uh d supplements uh may not increase all cause mortality risk but what about biomarkers for you know not just the uv uvb spectrum with vitamin d being you know a marker of that but uh red and near infrared you know what would we look at with yeah could it be blood pressure when considering a nitric ox nitric oxide or what would you think along those lines so nitric oxide is is one that's emerging um it's very short-lived so it's it's got a short halflife um one they're actually working on believe it or not is melatonin in sweat so this is something that they're actually looking at look at seeing whether or not this could be a good surrogate for infrared light there are developing light meters that actually measure infrared light but if it's true that infrared light can stimulate the mitochondria to make melatonin what they have been found finding in some of the studies that have looked at this is that they're finding that the melatonin concentration in the sweat is higher obviously than the melatone concentration in the bloodstream what does that mean it's got to be made locally and so if it's being made locally that's one way of measuring the effect of infrared light um it's difficult to do because the effects that we're seeing are occurring in an organel of the cell so this is not something that's readily available you have to be able to get markers inside of organel of cells to figure out whether or not the effect is actually happening but they may have it with melatonin we know for 100% sure that melatonin is made in the mitochondria we believe that it's related to infrared lights effect on the electron transport chain but that is still being worked out so uh the concentration of melatonin uh in mitochondria should be proportional to the concentration in the cytoplasm in the intra uh you know extracellular space and then potentially higher in the blood right so um well i don't know if it's actively uh transported out i do know that melatonin that's in the bloodstream goes into the mitochondria because that's where it's being produc uh sorry that's where it's being used it's also being produced there so i don't know if the melatonin is actually going down a concentration gradient outside the the mitochondria because it seems as though most of the oxidative stress and most of the use of the of the melatonin is right there in the mitochondria so so uh then a point of clarification because i've heard you mentioned that melat melatonin is the i think most powerful antioxidant in the mitochondri or inside the cell but i looked up i looked up the reaction rate constants for melatonin versus uh superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and it's uh on par with glutathione so the reaction rate constant being in the same ballpark for both super oxide and and uh uh glut eight hydrogen peroxide but uh as i'm sure you know superoxide dismutase which uh scavenges super oxide and converts it into hydrogen peroxide the reaction rate constant is like 10 to the 9th whereas for melatonin i think it's like 10 to the 3d or 10 to the 6th so you know a thousand times faster for the enzymes so i guess with a point of clarification would it be that melatonin is the non-enzymatic uh potentially best antioxidant or on par with the best i i don't know could you clarify the reason why i say that is because the the the next closest is glutathione and actually melatonin itself regulates the regulation of glutathione and upregulates glutathione so if you have a it by itself of course in a in a test tube in a laboratory where you're looking at enzyme constants there may be ones that are on par but the way that the the body is set up in the system the melatone when melatonin is being produced it actually activates and upregulates glutathione so in a human system melatonin is is the most powerful antioxidant because of its effects not just en atically but also on regulation so then all right now the story gets really interest interesting for me there because glutathion levels decline during aging melatonin levels decline during aging sunlight can impact intam mitochondrial levels of melatonin but where the story gets really interesting is that tryp thean is required to for you know you got a couple enzymatic steps for conversion into melatonin tryptophan levels decline during aging too so and part of that is because more of it reaches the gut where it's fermented uh or converted by gut bacteria to other other metabolites so um yeah i don't know i don't think i have a question there but there's a lot going on with the melatonin tryptophan and glutathione story sure and so the question was it will be important if tryptophan goes down if tryptophan is the rate limiting step um what we're seeing in individuals physiologically at least in glenn jeff's lab is that that's not a rate limiting step the rate limiting step it appears is red light and its effect on the uh electron transport chain interesting all right cool all right so then the built space so uh i recently bought a house and now i'm obsessed with you know uh the windows what kind of windows should i have and you mentioned you know the the the e windows which uh or e- gain i guess they're called low low e- gain yeah yeah so what kind of windows would be best for letting the red and near inf fred in and do they sell windows that block uv and the blue but allow the red and near infrared in they do you've got to look for them um it's it's not easy especially if you're trying to get windows for a home so i just recently put up a a greenhouse in my in my backyard it's um it's a greenhouse actually out of um belgium and the the windows there are great i can feel the heat i can feel the warmth of course they're designed for that right they're designed for for heat and warmth and and multispectrum light to come in uh not so for the windows that i just uh you know when i bought my house 15 years ago and i wanted to upgrade the windows i of course i didn't know anything about this and so i've got great low e glass uh that doesn't allow it in it's it's complicated um if you're able to get access to windows that don't have low e it's possible especially in canada and in higher latitude countries where you don't really want to block infrared because it's actually a way of of help heating it's another way of of reducing costs from a heating standpoint obviously in southern california where i live that those type of windows are going to be very rare because most of the problems that we have here is not a heating problem it's a cooling problem um so you've got to be creative but i think at the end of the day you know what what is the what is this going to depend on when they're building homes now at least where i live here in southern california they don't put sockets in where you can put uh incandescent bulbs and and led bulbs that screw in they're on purpose putting in receptacles that where you cannot put incandescent bulbs in you're forced to put led bulbs in and that's that's why i i conclude that you know there are some things that are out of our ability to change uh just because it's so difficult to do unless you have the money and the ability to do this because you got to get signed off right by the contractors and and the the people that um inspect so at the end of the day what's the most important thing to do you got to get outside you just got to get outside you got to open the windows because up till now they can't change light it's it's uh it's free it doesn't require a uh supply chain it's always going to be there uh we in southern california have probably probably the most amount of sundays in the country um maybe florida might have more but you know they get some rain clouds there too it's it's still good uh for those that don't have it like up in seattle i'm convinced that the the biological effects that glenn jeffrey is showing in his lab where he's able to shine light for just a few minutes in the morning and have effects for a couple of days might be the saving grace like if you're able to get out when there is sun that might get that might be good for you for the next two to 3 days and help out you know that study that we showed at oxford where in the previous 7 days every for every increased hour of sunlight there was in the previous seven days there was a better lipid profile increased insulin sensitivity so i do believe that the effect of sunlight on the human being is very quick it's very rapid and i think vitamin d is just one slice of that oh that was great all right so what's what's coming next for medc are there videos that you're working on that are soon to come that uh yeah yeah so this is this is my perennial topic one thing that i would really love to get into as well and i'm starting to look at this is the effect of temperature on the human body in terms of fighting viruses and diseases uh and i think there's a lot of data whether it's sauna data whether it's hydrotherapy data whether it's you know data where we don't treat a fever there's a recent paper that i've just come across that was published a couple of years ago looking at the mrna transcripts of particular viral fighting proteins that improve with just a small elevation of of temperature i think this is something that uh at least in the medical world we're trained to treat as an abnormality if somebody has a fever uh the nurse calls the doctor the doctor orders tylenol and we we we bring the fever down and thinking we've done something good i actually think that that's detrimental and one of the things that i'd love to do is not only talk about people getting outside in the sun at least for 15 to 20 minutes a day hey but the next time you have a fever that's reasonable not above 103 maybe worthwhile not treating the fever and maybe even going the extra mile and saying let's say you're feeling sick sick and you don't have a fever maybe instituting a fever maybe increasing your body temperature to induce some of those innate immune system reactions may be beneficial does thermo regulation decline during aging do older people have a harder time raising their body temperature absolutely and actually that is exactly what the focus of this paper that i'm reviewing is is that they're saying that this actually may explain why so many people during the pandemic the covid-19 pandemic uh who are older died of it because of exactly what you just said interesting all right fantastic uh thanks roger i appreciate you uh coming on and hopefully we'll have you back on at some point thank you so much cool thanks roger bye by bye
