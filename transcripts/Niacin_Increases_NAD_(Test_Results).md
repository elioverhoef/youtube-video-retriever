# Niacin Increases NAD (Test Results)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For any detest number seven i decided to go away from the day novo nad synthesis pathway and go back to the salvage pathway where for two of the seven tests i used nmn but instead of using nmn for this test i decided to use n a or nicotinic acid a form of niacin as a means for increasing nad so for this test did 600 milligrams per day of niacin impact nad and to assess that i sent blood to jinfinity for analysis and if you want to measure your own nad levels discount link in the video's description all right jumping right into it my nad level was 67.4 micromolar which is my highest nad level yet so that raises a few questions how does this test compare with earlier tests why did i decide to use niacin and then is 67 micromolar high enough so first how does this test 67 micromolar compare with earlier tests and what we're going to see here is my nad journey this is from january to july of 2023 seven tests for the first test my baseline this was without an r and a men niacin b6 grape seed as a source of proanthocyanins none of that just my baseline 25.6 micromolar so then i took 300 milligrams per day of nmn and it didn't move my nad levels at all essentially the same 25.3 micromolar so then thinking the dose wasn't high enough i decided to go with a thousand milligrams per day of nmn and that finally raised my nad levels to 39 micromolar so then i thought well i haven't really identified or addressed the root of the problem why nad is low in the first place so then i shifted my attention to the day novo nad synthesis pathway as i showed on the earlier slide where i did three experiments the first was uh b6 adding more supplemental b6 because as i showed in an earlier video there's an age-related decrease for b6 and if b6 levels are low you can't convert or you can't efficiently convert tryptophan into nad so increasing my b6 intake by about 3.5 fold move the needle in the right direction 30 micromolar but as we saw in the next test after that and with a higher b6 dose it the b6 didn't impact my nad the average over those two tests 26 micro molar essentially close to my baseline and that's with up to a 12-fold increase for vitamin b6 so then thinking that the age-related block may be with quinolinate or converting quinolinate into nad i then used grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins which have been shown to increase nad in rats and mice but for me that didn't work at all as you can see my led levels were their lowest or the lowest that they've been over those six tests 19.9 micromolar which then brings us to niacin so i returned to the salvage pathway because i wanted to go away from the day nova pathway because that didn't work and i wanted to go to get actually improvement i wanted to see improvement knowing that nmn improved my data i wanted to try niacin to see how that would react and there's more on why i decided to go with niacin in a minute so we can see that using niacin i got my highest reading yet of 67 micromolar so then why niacin i'm not going to focus on niacin versus nmn or nr only focusing on niacin's potential strengths and as they apply to me so in this study that was published in 2020 it shown that niacin cures any d deficiency and this was both in controls and in people who had adult onset mitochondrial myopathy and that's what we can see here so on the y-axis we've got whole blood levels of nad plotted against time and this was a 10-month study with blood sent for nad analysis at the 4 and 10 month time point the study included controls they were and this is a relatively small study of 10 controls and five patients with an average age of 50 to 51 years so then both were fed a thousand a thousand milligrams of niacin per day and for both groups we can see that there was a five to six-fold increase for circulating levels of nad now any niacin increased nadp which is nad but with a phosphate group added it also increased nadp too and that's what we can see here nadp levels on the y-axis and again plotted against time and this time only in in the controls there was a significant 20 increase for nadp levels so why is nadp important why am i highlighting this why do i care about nadp nadp is important because to produce dhea from cholesterol it requires nadph or the reduced version of nadp and that's what we'll see here so starting with cholesterol cholesterol is converted by five enzymatic steps as shown in blue into dhea or dehydroepy androsterone and then and then note that dhea sulfation so adding a sulfur group to dhea produces dhea sulfate so the importance of dhea sulfate is that besides being the most abundant androgen in men its levels decline during aging and relatively low levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and i won't go over that data in this video because i covered it in an earlier video so if you're interested it'll be in the right corner now also note that as a cofactor in each of these five reactions as shown in red is nadph in other words if nad is low nadp would probably also be low and if any dp is low the conversion of cholesterol into dhea will be inefficient potentially resulting in a low dhea sulfate level now in support of that hypothesis when considering my nad levels have been low my dhea sulfate levels have indeed declined during aging that's what we'll see here so i had two tests in 2005 and over those two tests my average dhea sulfate was 300 micromolar and then note that over the past 23 tests over the last year most of those with cyfox but the last seven or so using venipuncture we can see that my average dhea sulfate level is 117 micrograms per deciliter which is low based on age-related changes and all-cause mortality risk now for this most recent blood test my dhea sulfate levels weren't any better 114 micrograms per day leader even though nad increased from 25 to 67 micromolar which then raises the question you know for the next nad test if i increase nad further will i finally get an increase for dhea sulfate now if that's not the case i can pretty much cross off that its nad as a limiting factor for having low relatively low levels of dhea sulfate and then i can go back to focusing on either raising blood levels of cholesterol maybe it's possible that i have two low levels for blood levels of cholesterol so less of that is being converted into dhe sulfate or i may have a problem solved with sulfation and converting dhea into dhea sulfate so you doing the nad testing can help me clarify aspects of that hypothesis all right so to raise nad will i just go higher for niacin just increasing it above 600 milligrams per day so for at least one more test in contrast i'll return to the de novel nad synthesis pathway as shown here so why why will i do that so i mentioned earlier that up to 12 times higher for vitamin b6 paradoxify phosphate p5p had no effect on nad that suggests in my case i may not have an age-related block there similarly when i use grapeseed powder as a source of proanthocyanidines that didn't impact my id levels either in fact it actually reduced my nad levels when compared with my baseline so when considering that i may not have an age-related block at b6 or convert in converting quinoline aquinolinic acid into nad maybe there are no age-related blocks in my day novel nadesynthesis pathway now to test that if i supplement with tryptophan i could end up raising nad now my current tryptophan intake is one gram per day and that data is provided by chronometer there will also be a discount link in the video's description if you want to track your own diet using chronometer so when considering my current intake is one gram per day for the next test nad test i'll supplement with an additional one gram per day so i'll double my current tryptophan dose while not changing the niacin dose so one gram of tryptophan plus another 600 of niacin and we'll see if i'm able to further increase nad and potentially increase dhea sulfate so i sent blood for analysis yesterday so this the results should be in in the next week or so so stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health which note that their panel biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics and it also includes apob die tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatron brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
