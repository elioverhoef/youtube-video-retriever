# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #1 in 2023

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed that's the central premise of this channel so with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the first time in 2023 and for those who are new to the channel this is blood test number 42 since 2015. So with that in mind what's my biological age so we can see that data here this is using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own biological age using pheno age that link will be in the video's description so when entering its nine component biomarkers and chronological age we can see that my biological age is 33 years old which is 17 years younger than my chronological now note that for the eighth consecutive test quests high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 milligrams per liter but not higher than 0.3 milligrams per liter and rather than looking at just data that i've entered into a spreadsheet all blood test data will be included and we'll go through it later in the video now this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and i have data for 22 blood tests since that time and that's what we can see here so we've got levine's biological age on the y-axis plotted against time starting from 2018 on the left all the way up to through this most recent test so from 2018 to 2019 i have data for three tests my average biological age using levine's test was 36.1 years and then from 2020 to 2021 over 12 tests my average biological age was 35.6 years and then over seven tests in 2022 i significantly reduced the the value from 35.6 to 33.8 years and if you missed that video it'll be in the right corner so for 2023 we can see that what with my 33 year measurement that's off to a good start as it's lower than my average value for 2022. Now this isn't the only biological age metric that i use i also use aging.ai so what's my aging.ai age and where we can see that here when entering the 19 component biomarkers that are found on aging.ai 3.0 i get a predicted age of 20 28 years which is 22 years younger than my chronological age so just like we did for levine's test this is just one day one data point one test so for more context let's have a look at previous data for aging.ai age and that's what we can see here on the y-axis we've got aging.aih plotted against time starting from 2009 up through 2023. I should should say 2023 they're not 2022. So i have 38 blood tests over that period so in my earliest data from 2009 to 2013 i had three tests over five years and my average aging.ai age over that time was 32 years and then in 2016 i just started decided to test more often so over the time period from 2016 to 2022 over that seven year period i blood tested 34 times with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years and then with this test of 28 28 years old we can see that both phenowage and aging.ai these blood biomarker-based biological age metrics are off to a good start in 2023 so at this point in the video i usually ask what may be contributing to these biological age reductions including diet and or supplements and i do intend on including that data in a future video but not the next video two weeks from today so february 19th of 2023. So why why not go through it next week so in order to address that let's dig into the full blood test report as there's some interesting data at towards the end so here is the first page of the screenshot from quest lab report and i i'd like to highlight a few things first is homocysteine at 10.8 micromolar now if you saw the earlier video i had a hip-hop hypothesis that glycine supplementation may reduce homocysteine so i started glycine supplementation on december 15th at least two grams per day there were a couple days that i had four grams per day so i had at least 39 days of 2 grams per day of glycine prior to this test but we can see that it didn't impact homocysteine at all as home assistant went from 10 up up to 10.8 micromolar so i'm going to have to come up with a different way to reduce homocysteine so stay tuned for that now moving forward quest flagged a couple of things in my blood test data including the albumin to global globulin ratio which at 2.6 by their range is high so let's dissect the albumin to globulin ratio first my albumin for this test was 4.9 and i have a video on this what's optimal in terms of health and potentially longevity for albumin is albumin in the 4.6 to 4.8 range and that video will be in the right corner so if you're interested in that check it out so i'm just outside that range so not worried about it what about globulin at 1.9 so that brings us to the question what's optimal for globulin now i haven't come across in how globulin changes during aging most likely it increases but there is all cause more mortality data albeit not much in this study we're looking at the association for globulin with all-cause mortality risk or acm risk and this is in a study of more than 12 000 people so in this study 2.8 to 3.0 for globulin was identified as the reference and then we can see that only higher relatively higher levels of globulin higher than 3.3 was associated with a significant significantly increased all-cause mortality risk you can see that the hazard ratio is 1.47 which means a 40 47 increased risk for all-cause mortality when compared with globulin levels that were 2.8 to 3.0 and we can see that that's significant because the data in parentheses are both higher than one conversely for globulin levels that were less than the reference 1.7 to 2.7 which is where my data for this test would fall as my globulin level was 1.9 although the hazard ratio was 1.19 we can see that the data in parentheses overlaps with one so so that's not a significant association so globulin less than 2.8 in this case was non-sequently associated with an increase all cause mortality risk so with that in mind i'm not worried about globulin being a bit lower than i've had on previous previous tests now what also comes up as flagged as outside the range on quest quest data is alkaline phosphatase at 34. So what's optimal for alkaline phosphatase so again let's look at all cause mortality data that's we can see here alp is alkaline phosphatase and that's we're looking at the association for alkaline phosphatase with all cause mortality risk and this is in a study of more than 8.9 million people so for what's significant we go to a hazard ratio of one and then when the dashed black lines are completely above one we have statistics or below one we have statistically a statistically significant association and that's only true once we get to an alp of 48 units per liter so above 48 for alkaline phosphatase we can see a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk but that's not true for values less than 48 for alkaline phosphatase as you can see that the dashed black lines overlap with one so correspondingly i'm not worried about having an alkaline phosphatase of 34 on this test this may be an aberrant value my my alkaline phosphatase is a bit higher generally somewhere around 40 but not higher than 48 fortunately and then last on the blood test list that i want to highlight is dhea sulfate based on quest reference range that you can see there 61 to 442 micrograms per deciliter it's not flagged as low but if you if you've watched many videos on dhea sulfate on my channel it is indeed low and it's not indicative of youth but instead this is what you would expect to see from someone of my chronological age so how will i optimize dhea sulfate now cholesterol conversion into dhea the precursor metabolite for dhea sulfate you're just adding a sulfate group onto dhea requires nadph so let's take a look at that so that's what we can see here so starting with cholesterol cholesterol is converted into dhea by five enzymatic steps and each of them require nadph which then raises the question what is nadph so nadph stands for nicotinamide adenine the nucleotide and for those that are interested in longevity and familiar with the longevity space that should seem really familiar because that's nad so nadph is nad but with a phosphate group so nad phosphate is nadph which then raises the hypothesis is relatively low nad limiting the conversion of cholesterol into dhea in my case thereby limiting having dhea sulfate because d if dhea is low i would also expect that dhea sulfate is low so to address this hypothesis is relatively low nad limiting dhea sulfate i need to know what my nad level is and stay tuned for that data as that will be the next video that's all for now uh if you're interested more of my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be may be interested in including discount links for green tea epigenetic testing uh testing your oral microbiome at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in that that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
