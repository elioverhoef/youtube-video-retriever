Foreign so today i'm going to talk about uh optimizing lifespan lifespan potentially optimizing lifespan through biohacking so we've got a few learning objectives uh and i'm going to try my best to get through the first four uh we may not get to optimizing the oral microbiome but we're going to go over blood-based biological clocks epigenetic testing how i use diet tracking to optimize blood biomarkers and then optimizing cardiovascular cardiovascular fitness metrics including the resting heart rate and heart rate variability and then like i said if we get to it we'll uh go through the oral microbiome all right so i have no disclosures all right so in august i blood tested for the fifth time in 2022 so with that in mind what was my biological age so this is using uh dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator which is a metric of biological age and as you can see it contains nine blood test variables and chronological age and when crunching the numbers you get a biological age of 34 years which is 15 6 15.6 years younger than my chronological so it it could be actually a bit lower than that uh my uh high sensitivity c reactive protein measurement was at quest's limit of detection 0.3 so that could actually be less than 0.3 uh and this is only one test so uh for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and since then i have uh 20 blood tests so we can see that here uh we've got again levine's biological age on the y-axis applaud it against time so from 2018 to 2019 i just started collecting data i wasn't measuring c-reactive protein in every blood test because it's not something you get on a uh you know typically a a it's not something you get your yearly physical so i had to have it as an add-on test nonetheless over those first three tests my average biological age using levine's test was 36.1 years over six tests in 2020 35.6 success in 2021 again 35.6 and thus far over the first five tests in 2022 my average is currently 33.9 years so i've further reduced it by uh 1.7 years and beyond just looking at averages uh you know for year to year are they different you know are the averages different from year to year when doing a two sample t-test these are right at the border of statistical significance and i should should say i tested my sixth blood test on monday i posted that on my youtube channel or it's going to get posted tomorrow uh so this is a a little bit old news new news coming tomorrow but nonetheless this is a significant difference for a reduced biological age when compared with 2020 to 2021. So that's one way to look at it another way to look at it is by looking at the chronological age minus biological age so what that the magnitude of that reduction how far apart they are when compared with chronological age so prior to 2022 my average chronological age minus biological age reduction over 15 tests was about 12 years 11.9 to be exact thus far in 2022 i've further reduced that for every test uh 16.4 you can see with a low of 13.6 uh difference a greatest diff the greatest difference being 17.2 years with an average 22 2022 average uh chronological age minus biological age reduction of 15.3 years so i've further reduced that disparity between chronological age and biological age from about 12 years prior to 2022 to more than 15 years in 2022. Now what i haven't gone through is how good is this metric for uh it's predict for its ability to predict biological age and so we'll take a look at that and then how well does it associate with all-cause mortality risk and that can give us some insight about how good or not that this test is for as a predictor of biological age so levine's test is strongly correlated with chronological age and we can see that in two separate studies and haynes 3 and then haynes four and these were relatively large studies you can see uh about 10 000 and more than 11 000 people so the correlation for this test uh with chronological age was 0.94 and 0.96 so a perfectly linear is 1.0 so these are as close as you can get or cl pretty close to as close as you can get for almost perfectly being linearly correlated with biological age we can see that graphically represented here so phenotypic age again levine's test biological age plotted against chronological age you can see that almost perfectly linear red line there now levine's chronological age correlation with this 0.94 to 0.96 range is as good as the best epigenetic clock for for predicting chronological age which is the horvath test and uh probably most people know about the epigenetic tests and and the horvath test but uh just to illustrate this data is yeah we'll we'll see that this data just using conventionally conventionally measured blood biomarkers is as good as the best epigenetic test for its ability to predict uh chronological age so for that data for horvath that's what we can see here dna and age so dna methylation age or epigenetic age using the horvath clock plotted against chronological age you can see that there are lots of different colored circles that's because this is a multi-tissue clock question yes correctly 20 year olds to 90 year olds and before leaving their their blood work with their chronologically yep uh this study is two separate studies ten ten thousand about ten thousand eleven thousand each but yeah yeah so the whole horvath test uh is a multi uh cell and tissue clock as listed here so breast cells buccal cells brain colon cord blood etc uh and we can see that the correlation for epigenetic age using the horvath test with chronological age is 0.94 which is uh as good as the levine's levine's test or vice versa now uh levine's test isn't just strongly correlated with chronological age it's also been shown to be associated with all-cause mortality risk and that's we can see here all cause mortality risk this is a study of about 11 000 people so for every one year increase in uh biological age using levine's test all-cause mortality increases by nine percent which you can see we can see there and that association was true regardless of age groups whether whether looking at young middle aged or older you can see that as biological age increases using levine's uh levine's metric um all cause mortality risk increases for each of those age groups and this is true too for disease-specific mortality so an increased biological age using levine's test was associated with an increased mortality risk from heart disease cancer chronic chronic lower respiratory disease but not cerebrovascular disease diabetes related mortality influenza or pneumonia and then interestingly as a side note up to 15 years before the pandemic people who had an older biological age using levine's test had an increased mortality risk when after covid-19 diagnosis and then last but not least an older living levine's biological age is associated with an increased mortality risk from kidney related issues including nephritis or nephrosis now levine's test isn't the only blood-based biomarker panel that can easily assess biological age and the other one that i'm going to go through is aging.ai and i should mention that levine's test and aging.ai free to use which for me is a very a practical i don't think you should have to spend money for something that's been peer-reviewed and published so aging.ai that's the website and i'm not sponsored i have no affiliation with either of these two groups so aging.ai in contrast with levine's test it has 19 input biomarkers and these are found on the standard chemistry panel and complete blood count cbc which is about a 35 test so when including high sensitivity see reactive protein for levine's test together with these two biological age metrics it's less than 80 u.s usd so uh aging.ai's carnal correlation for its um for the 19 biomarkers with chronological age is 0.8 so not as strong as the levine test but still pretty good and note that chronological age isn't in its model so this is 0.8 without chronological age all right so how does it relate how does aging.ai relate to all cause mortality risk so just like levine's test biological agents that were younger than their corresponding chronological age were associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk and we can start to see that here first in a canadian cohort so people that had biological ages using aging.ai that were greater than five years older then their chronological age had a significantly increased all-cause all-cause mortality risk and then conversely people who had at least a five-year younger biological age using uh aging.ai had significantly reduced all-cause mortality mortality risk is shown there and then similar data was found in a u.s cohort so using nhanes so older age increased all-cause mortality risk younger aging.aih uh low a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk all right so what's my data how do i how do i fit into this context so when putting up the ninth data for the 19 biomarkers that are on aging.ai is shown there if anyone wants to double check my my map i get a predicted age of 31 years which is 18.6 years younger than my chronological now this is just one test and uh anytime someone tells me that they've got one test or two tests you know is that truly representative of what's going on systemically so i think more tests helps to tell the story so for more context let's take a look at my data since 2009 and i have 30 35 blood tests over that period so that's we've got aging.ai biological age 2009-2022 aging.ai on the y-axis so uh back in 2009 i wasn't testing very often it was just going once a year to my doctor and then recording that data in an excel file but nonetheless over three tests over about that five-year period 2009 and 2013 average aging.ai age was 32 years and then in 2016 i decided to kick it up a notch and test more often and then from 2016 to 2021 uh 27 tests with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years so what about 2022 that's what we can see here and this is through the first five tests it was actually 33 years for uh test number six um but again that's on my youtube channel tomorrow uh so after the first five tests in 2022 my average aging.aih was 29. So rather than making the jump and saying i've further improved that too i think what the fair thing to say is that my aging.ai age is consistently in the 29 to 32 year age range regardless of my chronological age regardless if i was in my early 30s or approaching 50. So what about epigenetic testing what's my biological age using that so to um to go through that i'm going to go through three tests uh horvath which i just introduced hannah and then a third dunedin pace and then for each of these tests just like we did for the levine test and aging.ai what's their correlation with chronological age what's their association with all-cause mortality risk and then what's my data so first corvas test which is also um known as the iea an intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration which is a bit of a confusing name so horvaths or that's epigenetic test for short so this is a measure of cell intrinsic aging and how so how does it uh correlate we saw with chronological age so we saw that here with those two tests 0.94 and then there's a second iteration of the horvath test horvath-2 which also had a very strong correlation with chronology chronological age of 0.85 so once again we can see horvath regardless of the iteration is strongly correlated with chronological age what about all-cause mortality risk so uh horvath's test is significantly correlated uh significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk this is a meta-analysis of 13 studies including more than 13 000 people and we're putting up the meta-analysis hazard ratio and p-value you can see that for a relatively older horvath age there's a significant increase in all-cause mortality risk but if there's a weakness in this these data this is a relatively small but significant increase for the hazard ratio it's 1.4 percent all right so what's my horvath epigenetic age and this is actually where the story turns and doesn't go how i expect it so i've tested epigenetic age now twice i sent my third sample out for analysis on monday in concert with my blood test number six data my first epigenetic test using corvath was in may of 2022 and i got an age of about 59 years so with rounding about six years older than my chronological age so then i i retested about six weeks later in july of 2022 and same ballpark 53.5 years in this case about four years older than my chronological age so to add insult to injury um horvath tests may be related to longevity and we know that because centenarian offspring have a lower intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration when compared with age match controls and we can see that here so uh iea on the y-axis and then we can see that centenarians had a significantly lower horvath epigenetic age when compared with age match control so uh that's potentially not good good news for me and that's one of the reasons why i'm attempting to biohack the heck out of aging if i can i don't have longevity genes and that may be one explanation for these data the longest live live person in my family was 95 none of the men besides my dad who's currently 80 live past 67. So if i'm going to get to my goal of living longer than anyone that's ever lived i'm going to really have to science the heck out of it at worst i see it as uh uh living as long as my genetics will allow regardless of breaking uh any longevity records all right so this is the bad news in terms of my epigenetic age there is good news though and that starts with data for the hanum epigenetic clock which is known as the eea extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration and this is the been designated as a marker of immune system aging so just like we did for all the other tests how is this clock related to chronological age and all-cause mortality risk so uh hanum's clock is significantly correlated with chronological age and we can see that here so dna mh again epigenetic age on the y-axis plotted against chronological age using that multi-cell and tissue clock and we can see a significant correlation for the hanum epigenetic test with chronological age albeit with a weaker correlation coefficient of 0.68 but still highly statistically significant as you can see by that p-value so uh hanum's epigenetic test is also significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk using that same meta-analysis of 13 studies that we saw for the horvath data and when putting up the meta-analysis hazard ratio and p-value we can again see that hantum's epigenetic age or a relatively older hanum epigenetic age is significantly associated with a 2.9 increased all-cause mortality risk all right so what's my data for hannah's epigenetic age so on the first test 30 36.87 so that was 12 years younger than my chronological age which kind of agrees with the um blood-based biological clocks and just to illustrate why this is thought of as a a marker of immune cell aging is because it adjusts for immune cell parameters including b cells cd4 and cda t cells nk or natural killer cells and then the amounts of basically the differentials for white blood cells lymphocytes neutrophils monocytes either synonyms and the cd4 to cd8 ratio all right so that was the first test what about the second essentially the same data 12 years younger than my chronological age so uh consistently i've got a 12 year younger epigenetic age all right so next up is the dunedin pace epigenetic test uh which is uh it was the name comes from the dunedin study and then paste stands for the pace of aging calculated from the epigenome so just like we did for every other test how is this test related to chronological age and all-cause mortality risk so first when looking at the correlation for dunedin pace with uh chronological age we can see a significant correlation uh albeit this is the weakest of the epigenetic test so why would i even include this data why is this epigenetic test important if there are others that are more strongly correlated with chronological age especially you know when considering the hanum data with the correlations uh 0.94 0.85 compared to 0.32 and hanum 0.68 again when compared with 0.32 so where this epigenetic test shines dunedin paste is for its association with all-cause mortality risk and its ability to detect the biological age reduction induced by cr calorie restriction in a human study so first anita pace is as good as the best epigenetic clocks for their association with all cause mortality risk and we'll take a look at two different studies to illustrate that point so first this was a study of men uh relatively small 771 people and then we're looking at the mortality effect size hazard ratio or risk for all-cause mortality on the y-axis uh and then we've got six different epigenetic clocks on the x first dunedin pace an older iteration of the need and paste which is the dunedin poem pace of aging methylation and then we've got horvath and hanum and then we've got a pheno age which has the same name as the blood-based biomarker test that i showed earlier but this is the dna methylation version of pheno age so it's a sep it's a separate test they don't relate at all in terms of if if you have blood-based biomarker data can you predict your dna methylation using pheno age you can it's a completely separate test and then last but not least for the epigenetic test grim age which in many studies has been shown to be significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk all right so which is what does the data say so for that we look at the hazard ratio has a ratio of one and then where the data where the confidence interval is either completely above above or below we have statistical significance so first starting with horvath and hanum in contrast with the meta-analysis data that i showed earlier in this study both of these epigenetic tests were not significantly associated with all cause mortality risk in contrast the need both the need iterations of the dunedin epigenetic test were as good as the pheno age and grimage for their ability to be associated with all-cause mortality risk all right so in the second study framingham framingham offspring this included both men and women and again going to the hazard ratio again we see that the horvath test was close to being significantly associated with all cause mortalities but it wasn't significantly associated whereas the hanum test was pheno age and grimage also were but once again we see that dunedin pace is as good as these other epigenetic clocks hanum pheno age and grimage for their associations with all-cause mortality risk so the best data for dunedin peso is um is that a younger biological age for people on cattle restriction was identified by this epigenetic clock but not by the other epigenetic clocks and this was a two-year randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in people so the average calorie restriction in this study was about 12 percent so the expectation is that people on cr would have a younger epigenetic age or dna methylation epigenetic age we're compared with people who ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted and in support of that in previous studies blood-based biomarker biological age was improved for people on cr so what about epigenetic age so for that let's take a look at how each of these epigenetic clocks was uh uh how it looked for people on cr when compared with ad-lib so first we've got the horvath clock on the left and then the hantum clock on the right and then we've got uh three time points so they're evaluated at baseline one year after being on cr and then 24 months after being on cr uh and then the two groups uh ad-lib in black and then the red triangles are calorie restriction so uh as you can see though so first they started uh at the same epigenetic age at baseline and that was true for all of the clocks but then um there was no significant difference in terms of epigenetic age using the horvath clock for people on ad-lib or on cr now if anything you know an argument can be made that there is some separation here for the red triangles but that would be for an older epigenetic age for the people on cr nonetheless the data was not statistically significant so we can't conclude anything other than there wasn't a difference in epigenetic age using the horvath test for people on cr for up to two years similar data was also found for the hanum clock virtually overlapping data so hanum hanum's epigenetic clock wasn't able to detect epigenetic age differences for people on cr when compared with ad-lib so what about pheno age and grimage which were consistently associated with all-cause mortality risk in the previous slide so just like these other two epigenetic clocks not significantly different and again to you can see some separation here for cr versus ad-lib even though it wasn't statistically different but again that would be for an older age for cr when compared with ad-lib uh so what about the dunedin uh epigenetic tests so looking at the first iteration dunedin poem this too was not uh significantly different when comparing cr versus ad-lib for the epigenetic changes as a result of the two-year rct but now we start to see some separation using dunedin pace after 12 months on cr we see that the cr group indeed had a lower epigenetic age and then at 24 months they also had a younger epigenetic age when compared with people who are eating an ad-lib diet so with that in mind when considering that dunedin pace is the only epigenetic clock that was able to detect epigenetic age or a slower epigenetic age as a result of calorie restriction what's my data so for my first test my dunedin pays value was 0.8 as shown there so what does that mean so the slowest epigenetic age aging rate would be 0.6 and that means that for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years so for my 0.8 that means for every year that passes my epigenetic age increases by 0.8 years in contrast to the fastest epigenetic aging rate would be 1.4 so for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age would increase by 1.4 years so not terrible i've got some room for improvement i want to get it obviously i want to you know everyone wants to be the best they can be so 0.6 is the goal so that was the first test for the second test my dunedin pace value was 0.82 so essentially reproducible data separated by six weeks so not bad all right so to summarize some summarize the epigenetic age clocks so i have a relatively older horvath epigenetic age one reason may be because of longevity genes and i say that superficially now you know from my experience in tracking probably 40 blood biomarkers over the past seven years things that were are well known in in published studies to be resistant to intervention for example lipoprotein a um aside from things like high-dose niacin therapy which uh anyway this things that have been thought to be not malleable i find that through regular tracking and attempts it at uh uh optimization through changing diet that almost every biomarker is malleable it's just a matter of having enough data and trying enough interventions and figuring out what it is that actually impacts that biomarker so for now superficially my horvath epigenetic age is terrible but it's only a matter of time before i have enough data and i have enough dietary data supplements etc you know fitness lifestyle that correlates with it and then i can start to try different interventions to bring my horvath epigenetic age test down all right so then i also have a relatively low hanum epic uh epigenetic age and this is a marker of youthful immune cell aging and then last but not least i have a relatively slow dunedin pace epigenetic age so a reduced epigenetic aging rate using that test all right so what's contributing to these data so for that i'm going to go through supplements diet composition and then cv cardiovascular fitness comments and using foreign so uh for patients for patients or anybody in general that would want to measure their rate of epigenetic change um when considering that none of the other epigenetic clocks were able to um detect the epigenetic age reduction as a result of cr i'd posit that maybe they're just these other epigenetic clocks may be better predictors of chronological age or all cause mortality risk but not necessarily um improvements in epigenetic age so this is this is the this is one reason why i'm so heavily focused on the blood-based biomarkers as my primary strategy is because uh things like albumin and the you know red blood cell distribution with these are things that have been studied for 50 to 100 years plus depending on the biomarker a lot of the epigenetic age stuff which is you know it's at the cutting edge and it's hot and it's new um even what aspects of aging that each of these clocks measure isn't ubiquitous they don't all measure the same thing like if you said which hallmarks of aging are each of these clocks measuring i mean that's still being discovered you know so um and actually uh epigenetic changes aren't just methylation it involves acetylation so if we're only looking at methylation are we getting the full story for epigenetic age changes um but uh i i still i still think if you're going to look at year-to-year changes i think it's important to look at dunedin pace uh yeah out of curiosity do you have maybe a 1298 with that influencer yeah so i've done uh i haven't done full genome sequencing but i've done 23andme and i've looked at some of the um snips related to methylation status um i i didn't see anything of note where that may be the case but my homocysteine which is a marker of methylation has basically doubled over the past um 15 years so it could be lifestyle related it could be that i don't have any methylation defects and and it could be lifestyle related and i just haven't yet figured out what it is that affects uh the horvath test for example but in support of that knowing that my homocysteine levels were about half of where they are now actually a little bit more uh more than half um if i had a methylation defect i would have predicted that my home assistant would probably be higher when i was younger rather than exhibiting an age-related change so um this the snip stuff in terms of having a methylation defect is tough too because um you know there companies like 23andme will give you a few but do the few represent really the the many right like how many how many snips really are there that can affect methylation status is it only a handful or is it you know you've got you've got snips that will positively affect methylation status and you've got snips that will negatively affect it is it is it hundreds or thousands so um i tend to focus less on the genetic disc predispositions i focus on the biomarkers trying to optimize that and if if there are some defects and then i've gotta go super physiological for some nutrients or supplements um i i find that i can still impact these things so uh yeah all right so what's contributing to these data so uh just in starting with supplements and i think that most people when they see or hear about my approach they probably assume that it's supplement heavy i mean there are people in this space like ray kurzweil who take hundreds of supplements which uh yeah that that's not the case in my situation so in terms of supplements and i don't know that i can call it a supplement it's a prescribed medication i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s atrophic thyroid glands i've been taking levothyroxine for probably half my life and then i do occasionally take melatonin uh so for the 42-day period that corresponded to uh this blood test in august i took a very small amount of melatonin for three nights out of those 42 days that notice that's in micrograms that's not that's not milligrams it's a small bite of 100 or 200 micrograms a night and then that's it usually i take vitamin d because i live in the northern latitude for about nine months out of the year but for this test because it was a summer test i'd get regular sun exposure 30 30 to 35 minutes a session two to three times a week and that's it no other supplements uh no jail protectors no xenolytics so those aren't necessary to achieve where my blood test and epigenetic age test data is for now but maybe that's the argument to use some gero protectors to see analytics for the horvath data you know so you can look at it both ways all right so what about diet how is diet how am i using diet to contribute to these data so first is how am i tracking diet so we see that the blood test was on august 22nd so how do i link diet with each blood test so my average daily intake from my last blood test which was on july 11th through this blood test the day before this blood test corresponds to blood test number five in 2022. So let me just detail that a little bit a little bit more so here we're looking at july and august 2022 so i tested test number four on july 11th and then test number five on august 22nd so the 42 days there are 42 days in between those tests so every day since 2015 i've weighed all of my food prior to intake and then i entered those food amounts into an online tracking tool chronometer there are many apps that can be used i mean i just use this for convenience i don't know which one is best but that's just the one that i've settled on to use uh since 2015. And then i entered daily daily chronometer data into a spreadsheet and then the average intake for those 42 days including individual food amounts macro micronutrients corresponds to blood test number five so then each blood test has a corresponding average diet composition and with enough blood tests and enough diet compositions that correspond or an average dietary composition that corresponds i can calculate correlations and then based on those correlations i alter the dietary intake to optimize blood biomarkers now the question of what's optimal for each of these biomarkers i've done deep literature reviews for each of these uh biomarkers that i'm going to show i'm not going to show it here it would take way too long and the data gets way too dry but in terms of how do these biomarkers change in terms of aging and all-cause mortality it's got focused my uh you know the the data there in terms of what's optimal so let's start off by taking a look at individual food amounts for that 42-day period so i've broken it down just in terms of a list from highest to lowest highest at the top ranked you know so 1 to 23 lowest being walnuts and this is half of it i'm going to show the other half in a bit in a minute so why would these foods be at the top and i don't have the time to go through the details in this talk but i covered that in an earlier video i didn't want to rehash old data so that's in test number four and again that's on my youtube youtube channel if anybody's interested so the primary goal for test number five though when considering that 2022 has been a significant improvement over 2021 uh was basically maintenance with some small tweaking uh so i essentially wanted to reproduce test forge data in terms of biological age and keeping the diet as close to that as possible with again very small tweaks so then what was different for this fifth test versus the fourth test so i had an unintentional change and this had to do with my berry intake and you can see that my strawberry intake for test number four was 622 grams per day and it was about half that for test number five and the unintentional change was that costco ran out of the three berry mix or this it ran out of strawberry so i had to switch to a three-baried mix so accordingly we see an increase in blackberries and blueberries for test number five and a reduction in strawberries so that was an unintentional change an intentional change was an increase in sardine intake so we can see that for test number four i averaged 99 grams per day whereas for test number five it was significantly different at um and the p-value there is actually i can't be right that's wrong that's the uh blackberry and blueberry data but nonetheless it was significantly higher about by about 15 grams per day so why did i increase sardine intake for test number five so the majority of my b12 intake comes from sardines and prior to this test b12 was significantly correlated with lower homocysteine so why is homocysteine important so here we're looking at hyperhomocystinemia which is defined as greater than 15 micromolar and we'll see why 15 uh may not be relatively high uh it's actually uh or we'll we'll see more about its importance in a minute so hyper homocysteinemia is associated with the adverse health and or function of multiple organ systems including cardiovascular brain eye the reproductive apparat apparatus in women the pancreas bone and kidney so homocysteine increases during aging and we can see that here plasma levels homocysteine on the y-axis and this is from 12 year olds up to uh older than 80 year olds and we can see that for both men and women home assist home assisting values are relatively you and youth somewhere around seven micromolar whereas in people older than the navy uh it's around 12 micromolar so what about older than 80 years especially considering that i intend on living a lot a lot longer than 80 years so in this study of centenarians we can see that the median age of the more than 1700 people in this study the median age was 100 years so technically this is a centenarian-based study we can see that serum levels of homocysteine were 23 so way higher than the 80 year olds of uh you know having 12 micromolar so the long story short there is if we if we if we live long enough we may all have elevated homocysteine so i mentioned that prior to this test b12 is significantly correlated with homose lower homocysteine what's my data so this is my average b12 intake when compared with homocysteine and this is over the past five years homelessness another test that isn't on a standard chem panel on the cbc it's an add-on test so i didn't start adding it on to almost every test until 2017. So i only have 20 data points i mean i say only data for 20 data points but i have 20 data points over the past five years and what we can see is a significant correlation between b12 intake with a homocysteine significant inverse correlation so the higher my b12 intake the lower homocysteine is and the majority of that though comes from methyl b12 supplementation so when i've supplemented with methyl b12 we can see that my average homeless homocysteine is uh was 9.4 micromolar conversely without supplementation close to 12 micromolar so um this seems like an easy fix right to further reduce homocysteine why don't i just supplement with a thousand micrograms per day of homocysteine and then just call it a day just whatever that ends up being in terms of lower lower levels well in my case a relatively higher b12 intake is significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so for that we this this is a big part of my approach is looking at those correlations so here we're going to take a look at correlations for b12 intake with what i've designated as big picture biomarkers so what are the big picture biomarkers so they obviously in things include things like glucose which in my opinion should be a part of any anti-aging strategy or any strategy intended for longevity and then it's also got homocysteine but then we've got three markers of kidney function creatinine bond blood urine nitrogen uric acid three markers of liver function alkaline phosphatase albumin ast aspartate amino transferase all the major lipoproteins hdl ldl vldl lipoprotein a immune related components so neutrophils lymphocytes percentage of lymphocytes monocytes and then platelets and then it's it's not an immune cell but a total level of globulins so immunoglobulins red blood cell related measures including total levels of red blood cells but also the mcv the average volume within a red blood cell and the red blood cell distribution with rdw a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c-reactive protein and then the overall biological age score so there's a couple more uh bits of information that are on this uh image the n next to each blood test is how many blood tests data that i have for each variable so 37 tests are glucose 21 tests for homocysteine and then the r is the correlation coefficient and the p-value is whether it's statistically significant or not with less than 0.05 being a significant correlation all right so then the next question is what's significantly associated with b12 intake so first we can see that significant uh correlation with homocysteine so higher levels of b12 are significantly correlated with lower homocysteine and i i think this is an important point to mention because i find a lot of i find a lot of reductionism whereas you know most people will focus on optimizing glucose or you know whether it's using a cgm or uh you know the lipid panel and they'll be on a specific diet and they'll say look at my glucose and look at my lipid panel but what about kidney function what about immune cells what about inflammation um there are many more parameters to measure just besides one thing so if i only focused on homocysteine i could just call it a day i'd just take lots of b12 and never worry about anything else but that's probably not a good idea because at least based on this data a relatively higher b12 intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose with a higher blood urine nitrogen with higher levels of alkaline phosphatase higher levels of neutrophils higher levels of monocytes and a lower lip percentage of lymphocytes so then the next step would be to determine you know are these correlations going the right or wrong direction in terms of aging and all cause mortality risk and you know just as as i mentioned without going through all of that data in terms of showing it just to say it i mean glucose increases during aging so relatively higher levels would be a bad thing so that correlation with b12 is going the wrong direction blood urine nitrogen also increases during aging alkaline phosphatase doesn't increase during aging but relatively higher levels are associated with increased all cause mortality risk neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging uh and whereas the percentage of lymphocytes the clients are engaging so very clearly each of these positive correlations with b12 intake are going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or all-cause mortality risk so i've given them that red arrow whereas the green arrow is it's going in the right direction in terms of aging and or all cause mortality risk and then there are three correlate stations that are a bit more uh tricky to decipher for example red blood cells and platelets are positively correlated with b12 intake and both of these decline during aging so you superficially it would look that having a positive correlation with b12 this is a correlation that would potentially reverse age-related changes but i find that in my data having relatively higher levels of platelets and this is within the 200 to 300 range which has been shown to be associated with lowest law cause mortality risk but then the question is do i want to be closer to 200 do i want to be closer to 300 so there's a bit of fine tuning here so nonetheless when i do a biomarker versus biomarker analysis which is platelets red blood cells and even ldl which was significantly correlated with b12 intake each of these biomarkers having relatively higher levels is significantly correlated with more of the big picture biomarkers going the wrong direction than right so i've given them red arrows too now even if i don't give red arrows to the red blood cells uh ldl and platelets we still have those six that i mentioned earlier that have definitive definitely going in the wrong direction so the net effect would be negative for a relatively higher b12 intake on these big picture biomarkers at least the ones that were had statistical significance with the p-value less than 0.05 so nonetheless i've given it a net score of minus eight nine biomarkers not in red and one biomarker in green so what is what does that mean how do i decipher that so if the net score was positive i would eat above my average intake since uh 2015 for the data that i have since 2015. If the net score is zero i aim for my average intake and if in this case the net score is negative so i would eat below my average intake so my average b12 intake since 2015 is uh 542 micrograms per day but note that so the then one can say all right just just taken 300 micrograms or 50 micrograms but note that homocysteine wasn't dramatically reduced at 300 micrograms per day with an average of 10.1 and we're considering that youth is somewhere around 7 micromolar uh and we're considering that at relatively higher levels of b12 more blood biomarkers are significantly correlated with going in the wrong direction than right so i i'm out of luck it looks like with supplemental b12 so with that in mind i tried to reduce homocysteine with a smaller intake of b12 by increasing my sardines now you may think one microgram increase from sardines versus 300 with supplementally 12. I mean i didn't know you wouldn't know until you actually did the experiment so in my case homocysteine didn't get reduced with a higher sardine intake a purposely higher sardine intake and it's b12 but i do lots of these little experiments to see what hits and what doesn't r values on those two data points test four and five versus multiple right so so so remember since 2015 i have how many blood tests the little n on the left for for each blood biomarker so for each test i have an average dietary intake and then so if i have 35 tests i have 35 data points for diet and for blood tests so it's correlation it's it's it's never just two data points it's all of the data just out of curiosity so if you're you know if you have an rb12 you're lowering your home assistant that that's a complete phone chain did you do any supplementation with glycine or mac yeah so i wish i could measure i wish i could measure it not total glutathione but gsh and gssg i've yet to find a commercial lab in the u.s where i can measure both gsh and gssg um independent of the homeless sustain story i mean there's there's an abundance of data maybe not an abundance but there's an emerging literature on glutathione in randomized control trials in extending lice positive effects and randomized control trials in older adults extending lifespan and mice being relatively higher in centenarians even though glutathione declines during aging so yeah i'd love to measure and track and optimize my gsh and gssg in the ratio but in total glutathione doesn't really tell me anything because i could have high gssg and low gsh and my totals look fine though but i have supplemented with folic acid and b6 i've tried and i've documented this in videos on my channel on youtube but uh i've tried tm tmg trimethylglycine i've tried the combination of folic acid b12 mb6 at the same time and it all goes into the average dietary composition so uh so i i am looking at correlations for a full you know folate and b6 basically every nutrient with homocysteine uh and in my case uh even with folate intakes up to i think 1700 micrograms per day uh most of that coming from diet though um not significantly not significantly correlated with lower homocysteine b12 is of of those four tmg folic acid b6 b12 um b12 is the only one that's significantly significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in my data because it's a little off the off the topic sorry what's your rationale for taking uh levothyroxine and not like either armor or some kind of compound or thyroid medicine so uh uh when i was a grad student in texas i actually took t3 uh and when i came to boston in 2010 they basically forced me off that so um i'm actually thinking a combination therapy of t4 and t3 may be better because i tend to be low towards uh on t3 i'm sure uh i mean my uh so i actually measured my um the net the net effect is what are my levels right my t3 free t3 free t4 tsh so i actually tested that twice the last two weeks and uh the first test my free t3 was relatively low which suggests a deficit and converting t423 which goes back to maybe i should should be on supplemental t3 which i was i'm ready to have an argument with my endocrinologist about that you know but um but then i tested that was with fingerprint but then i tested with venipuncture the next weekend my free t3 and free t4 levels were actually decent they weren't they weren't uh they weren't bad so um whether it's armor armor or uh just taking levothyroxine i don't know that that would be better i may have a deficit in converting the t4 to t3 so how do you fix that is the bigger issue that's on my list to to i didn't when i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism back in the day but uh it'd be good to follow up and see nope but i will though yeah that's that's that tufts is right down the street so it's just uh you know it's an easy thing to go to but uh you know i should it shouldn't be a war where i have to it's not like i'm coming at this uh from just you know some shmo off the street who doesn't know what he's talking about you know i i i'm a scientist at tufts i've got data and evidence to support my thing and yet it's still i feel like i'm barking up a tree you know so but yeah good point someone here had a question no she didn't but i think you had a question or yeah i don't know that i was i mean uh i don't know how you diagnose uh hashimoto's but i hadn't i atrophic thyroid gland and uh i may just not make enough thyroid gland but uh anyway that's in theory in terms of these big picture bob markers my thyroid should be my thyroid status should be on here too so i have plans to incorporate that data because even though in the past i've tried to optimize my thyroid level hormones without something without levothyroxine and had no success i mean my tsh goes sky high if i'm not supplementing with something um it's because that's a condition specific to me i should still incorporate and then i'll probably also include adrenal hormones because as we'll see i may have some deficits going on there too all right so in terms of rest of the diet so that's the remaining 45 up you know up to 45 foods ranked in terms of abundance so for this test what was also different was my date intake and why that's important will become evident in a second so for this test uh it was 12 12.4 grams whereas for test number four is 25 grams so i cut it in part because of that unintended change by costco with switching to berries so uh black bears and blueberries have a higher fructose content which higher fructose in my data is bad you know bad uh it's uh correlated with more blood biomarkers going the wrong direction right which we'll see in a minute so to account for that i adjusted my date intake down to reduce total fructose but in terms of homocysteine that may have been a a relatively bad idea because interestingly a higher data intake is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in my data now i have a bit less data for tracked food intake unfortunately i didn't have the idea i've been tracking macros and micros since 2015 but i didn't have the idea to track individual food amounts until somewhere around 2018 2019 so i have a lot less data for individual foods versus the biomarkers but nonetheless i have 13 data points for homocysteine versus my average date intake which is what we can see here and we can see a significant inverse correlation so the higher my date intake that's significantly correlated with a lower uh homocysteine so for this test for test number five my homocysteine was at its highest and data intake was at its lowest so here too it would seem like okay if dates have some impact on homocysteine just increase your data intake to your highest level somewhere in the 35 to 40 gram range per day but when looking at correlations between dates with the big picture bomb markers they have a net correlative score of -4 which which suggests i should be below my average intake of 29 grams per day rather than going higher so for test number five i increased it from 12 to 20 actually it was 25 right 25 grams for test number six i should say i increased it to 26 grams per day and although i won't go over it in this thing i've actually reduced homocysteine back down to around 10. Now why that's also important is because you could say what if dates were just hired during those periods when i was supplementing with b12 and actually when i did when i looked at those correlations that was indeed true so when my b12 intakes were at their highest through supplementation my date intakes were at their highest so if i stopped there and didn't actually do the experiment i wouldn't see that without b12 in my diet and keeping dates relatively high i saw a whole home assistant come down from 12 to 9.7 micromolar on my test on monday so for some reason dates may have an impact or maybe other stuff in my diet which i doubt but this is the strongest correlation for reduced homocysteine in my data which is that date intake now people always ask what you know is your diet always clean what do you do about junk how do you eat you know with other people around you eating junk so if i do have a cheat meal what works for me is that it's on the day of right after the blood test and then immediately uh and then on the day after and then i shut it down literally no junk for until the next blood test for so for this test it was uh the first two days and then no junk for 40 days until test number five and then i uh just to illustrate in terms of amounts it was uh nutella i mixed it with peanut butter so it's like homemade reese's peanut butter cup and then i had swedish fish and then i had to also put the amounts here because someone someone online saw that i posted the amount in grams per day and thought that i was literally eating you know a teaspoon of nutella a day which is insanity nobody has that kind of discipline so it was uh it was 147 grams over two days uh swedish fish 60 grams in one day and then nothing for 40 days and that's what works for me i can't do once a day i can't do once a week cheat day cheap week i have to have have it and then forget about it uh and that's what works for me and then also chew gum which is technically junk during my workout but other than that it's a clean diet whole food based uh no other junk all right so that's the food composition what about macro and micronutrient composition is it high fat is it high carb is it high protein where do we stand there so this is the calorie protein and fat intake that corresponds to test number five so starting with calorie intake i average just a bit under 2300 calories so why that amount so i'm doing the correlation analysis for calorie intake versus the big big picture biomarkers calorie intake and my data has a net correlative score of minus five so that means that five biomarkers are going in the wrong direction and in this case none are going in in the right so a relatively higher calorie intake is significant correlated with higher alkaline phosphatase higher ast higher ldl higher platelets and higher rdw which are all going in the wrong direction in terms of aging and or are cause mortality risk so when the score is negative that means that suggests i should eat below my average intake my average calorie intake since 20 15 is uh about 25 50 calories per day so we can see that the 2294 is below that so we give it a check mark that i'm following the correlations and i i can't say you know with this approach it's you know correlation doesn't uh equal causation it's hard to say that you know so when i when i do the correlation analysis i may get 15 things that are correlated with a given mile marker so if i only go after the first one is that first one the big tree in the forest that will really impact the biomarker or is it you know do i have to follow 10 correlations for a given biomarker to get that biomarker to change so uh i think it makes the most sense to follow as many correlations as possible for diet with the blood biomarkers not just the top hit or the second hit but as many as possible so calorie intake following that so far protein intake 97 grams per day it's about 70 of my calories why that amount we go to the correlation analysis protein intake a relatively higher protein intake seems to be bad for me with a net correlative score of minus eight this is also an interesting one too because for some reason a relatively higher protein intake of my data is significantly correlated with lower homocysteine so if i again if i stopped there and only had you know reduction to some dietary reductionism if i only looked at the correlation for protein intake with homocysteine i'd say just eat a lot of protein maybe homocysteine comes down and if i didn't consider all the other biomarkers i would never know that higher protein intake intake in my data may be systemically bad as you can see with the nine biomarkers going in the wrong direction so that net eight minus score suggests i should eat below my average 112 and a half grams per day so 97 is less than that we give that a check mark too all right so then fat intake for this test it was 83 grams per day which is about 33 of my diet so why that amount we go to the correlation analysis so total fat in my data has a also a strong negative score minus seven so uh just indicate which ones uh that they're correlated with i'll put them up there if anyone's interested so total fat but isn't isn't homogeneous it breaks down into mono and poly poly and saturated fat so my average intake for total fat is 86 about 86 grams per day so the minus seven score suggests i should eat below that so for this test i was purposely at 83 grams per day so we give that a check mark because we're following the correlation all right then monounsaturated fat and actually this is this is an interesting one because 15 grams per day doesn't seem like a lot but i increased that uh for this test that i just did on monday and um for whatever reason monounsaturated fat just from nuts avocado negative score on my data um it's significantly correlated with a lower mcd but higher levels of glucose and red blood cells so the net negative score suggests i should eat below the average intake and we can see 15 is less than the 17 so give it a check all right and then in terms of polyunsaturated we've got omega-3 and omega-6 so now actually we see if i only focused on total fat and didn't look at the individual fat distributions i would miss that omega-3 and as we'll see omega-6 actually have net net positive scores in my data so omega-3 score of plus three that suggests i should eat above my average intake of seven grams per day so 8 is higher than seven so i'm following that correlation so i'm actually going to increase this more uh for my next test or test number seven this year and see how it impacts the biomarkers omega-6 also net score of plus three and again this isn't based on you know seed oil-based uh food sources this is whole food based so plus a score of plus three suggests that i should be above my average intake 16 is greater than 15 and a half following the correlation saturated fat has a score of negative six in my data so uh 23 is less than 27 i'm following that correlation too now interesting thing about saturated fat is most of this may be driven by dairy saturated fatty acids so for whatever reason in my data cheese and full fat yogurt um more biomarkers going the wrong direction than right whereas saturated fat you know from whether it's fish or coconut butter uh don't cocoa beans don't have a similar correlation profile to the dairy uh set you know the dairy correlation profile so i may actually raise the saturated fatty acids that are not from dairy and see how that goes and see how the correlations change if they do over time and then lastly on this list but not least the total cholesterol has a very strong negative score of my data which suggests i should be below my average intake of 126 milligrams per day so 24 is less than that so i'm following the correlation and i'll have more on cholesterol uh in a few slides so uh based on the checks i'm six for six and following the correlations for fat intake with the big picture biomarkers and as i mentioned that's important because i don't know which of these if any of these on their own can independently affect the biomarkers so by following as many correlations as possible i would expect the best biomarker blood biomarker profile to result all right so what about carbohydrate intake so for test number five it was about 50 percent of my total diet so why that amount we go to the correlation analysis and we can see that net carbs have a net score of uh plus one which suggests i suggest i should eat above my average intake of 234 grams per day so i was above that so we give that a check and then fiber has a score of plus one two so that suggests i should need above my average intake which is 97 grams per day so here is where there's actually an x so uh 91 i can go higher for fiber but then it starts to increase it starts to alter other biomarkers and uh you know something about this approach that i want to highlight too is is that is a score of plus one as is it going to impact the biomarkers as much as a score of -8 like protein intake or saturated fat minus six so um even though i'm not following this correlation uh you know by having 10 more grams of fiber per day i wonder how much the ones plus ones and zeros affect the biomarkers relative to the big hits like protein intake or total fat intake with a score of minus seven and then i mentioned total fructose intake earlier which i track of sugar intake i track the fructose intake because my diet is rich in fruits and vegetables so i tend to eat a lot of fructose and i could eat pounds of fruit every day but we can see by a score of -3 that may not be good for my blood biomarkers so that suggests i should eat below my average which is 85 grams per day so 65 is less than 85 so we give that a check so what about micronutrients and i'm not going to go through all these i'm just going to highlight i'm going to highlight the a few key vitamins and minerals so first uh we'll have a look at niacin which has a very positive score of my data of plus seven so i should eat above my average intake based on the rules that i've set for uh you know positive negative and zero scores so 42 is higher than 30 36 so we give that a check now the rda this this approach also goes to beyond the rda what's optimal you know so it's easy to just meet the rda but um you know what's optimal at the individual level uh not just for macros you know macronutrients but also for micronutrients and using this approach i've uh i i see the data that uh you know like i said beyond the rda we can address what's optimal so just to illustrate that the rda for niacin is 16 milligrams per day so i'm two and a half fold higher than the rda there and with a score of plus seven that would suggest that that's net net positive in contrast we saw that b12 correlation of -8 so there aren't hard and fast rules where if you go you know two times higher than the rda or four times higher than the rda or ten times whatever uh we can see that you know going higher as you know 542 that's bad for my data so um you know again this approach can get close to that you know that question of beyond the rda what's optimal and then another one i want to highlight is beta-carotene which also goes to the idea of um reductionism so when i first started this journey if anybody goes to my youtube channel and sees my uh videos on albumin um which is the most abundant protein in blood which illustrates its importance for tracking it and making sure it doesn't decline during aging uh beta-carotene has almost always been strongly correlated with relatively higher albumin in my data but in my early days of this approach i only looked at you know uh one correlation at a time basically and didn't consider it the other biomarkers so if i did that i would miss that beta-carotene has a very strong negative uh score in my data it is it is significantly correlated with higher album but it's significantly correlated with nine biomarkers nine other biomarkers going the wrong direction right so that suggests i should eat below my average intake which is 54 000 micrograms per day or about 54 milligrams per day so 50 milligrams per day is less than 54 milligrams per day so i'm following the correlations so just to highlight a few more vitamin d 300 ius per day that's below the rda but this was the summer time uh blood test so i was getting regular sun exposure and then if that was low we'd expect to see it reflected in my blood test data so i used an at-home blood testing company and over 10 blood tests my uh 25 hydroxy d was 60 about 64 nanograms per ml which is a lot higher than what's been uh you know published 30 30 nanograms per milliliter is is defined as deficient so i'm far from being deficient with no vitamin d supplementation and my regular sun exposure in the summer so i'm not too worried about my dietary intake of 300 being below the rda of 600. And then another one i'd like to illustrate is vitamin k so we can see uh almost 2 000 micrograms per day which is uh the plus two score suggests i should eat above my average of 1564 so that gets a check 1955 higher than 50 1564. Now the rda or an ai for vitamin k is only 120 micrograms per day so here we can see that i'm 16 times higher than the what's defined as as an adequate intake but yet it has a net overall positive correlative score of plus two so if 16 times the rda was too much i'd expect to see more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right using vitamin b12 you know as shown earlier as an example and then a few more so minerals copper scores plus three that's just that should be above my average intake of 4.3 uh milligrams per day 4.7 is above that so give it we give it a check and for rda note that the rda for copper is 0.9 milligrams per day so here i'm five times higher again no hard and fast rules for how high or how much above the rda that one should go but this is a data-driven approach to figure out what may be optimal at the individual level and then another one i'd like to highlight is magnesium so net score of zero that suggests i should eat right at my average intake of 800 milligrams per day which i'm not i'm about 700 but that is higher than the rda so um but this again goes to my point of you know for the scores that are zero minus one plus one uh if you're close to the average is that going to impact the biomarkers as being you know if this was three 300 it would probably be a problem uh you know so i tend to focus most on the biomarkers on the on the scores that have the very most positive and very most negative and i'd expect the most positive most negative to most impact the biomarkers all right so this is the diet section so what about fitness and i'm not going to go over my usual workouts but uh another aspect of including strength training and mobility and balance and all that all that is important it's a it's a huge part of my approach but i'm going to focus on the more objective metrics like uh cardiovascular fitness metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability so as i mentioned earlier if we track and optimize biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging be slowed and then what should we track so in a recently published preprint this is pretty well covered um and i also mentioned earlier that most people i find only focus on health and anti uh only for only focus on metabolic markers including glucose and lipids and then many of the biomarkers that are in my big picture uh on my big picture list are included on those two biological age calculators including pheno age and aging.ai including the immune cells liver markers kidney markers so creatinine is one of them so you can assess egfr but then notice there there are other organ systems that are missing and you know i don't i think i think it i think it's easy to focus on the biology biological age test but the biological age test whether blood-based or epigenetic may have blind spots and i don't want to get to an advanced age and only focused on you know the biomarkers that are on these biological age tests and then realize some adverse health condition because i just didn't track all of the organ systems i only tracked a few so for example a musculoskeletal measures are not on the biological age test and note that leanness and fitness are a big part of my approach so i'm not skipping out on that but until relatively recently i wasn't addressing pulmonary function so i bought a spirometer so i'm regularly tracking my forced expiratory volume in one second now uh so i can work on optimizing that over time uh brain based biomarkers are not on any of the tests that i mentioned uh and that's a tough one to track because there aren't any commercially available blood-based biomarkers that are good for predicting brain health mris are probably the best thing you can get but you know i think it's going to be hard to convince uh you know uh hard to convince my doctors to let me get a brain mri six or seven times a year and then last but not least cardiovascular metrics are not on these blood-based biomarker tests so um with that in mind let's take a look at the data for resting heart rate and heart rate variability so first how does the resting heart rate change during aging so this is whoop data i mean that's what i wear i'm not sponsored by them there are many companies that are doing this all of them reliable mostly reliable to detect uh resting heart rate and heart rate variability so using whoop zone data resting heart rate increases during aging from the 20 to 50 year age range for both men and women so men in blue and women in red so you can see those age-related increases there so that's from 20 to 50 years what about older than 50 years so this is a fitbit data average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age and just like the whoop data we can see that uh resting heart rate does indeed increase up to 50 years of age but then notice that after 50 we then see a significantly a decrease for resting heart rate and this is in a study of 92 000 people so it's a relatively large study so resting heart rate increases then decreases during aging so note that a relatively low resting heart rate is found in both young and people of advanced age so then how would you know if you're relatively low heart rate or resting heart rate was indicative of youth or eight or aging so that's where heart rate variability comes in that that can give provide more context so what is the heart rate variability so the standard definition is that it's the variability for the time in between heartbeats so for a heart rate of 60 beats per second the assumption is that the heart beats exactly once per second but that's not necessarily true so here we can see the time in between three different heartbeats and the the time in between those heartbeats is is different in this in this simplified cartoon which would result in a in a heart rate variability of 67 milliseconds so this is using the root mean squared of successive differences rmssd there are many different measures of heart rate variability but this is the one that will provides and this is the one that i'll be showing data for today so how does heart rate variability change during aging so we can see that here so we've got the rmssd on the y-axis again heart rate variability plotted against age 20 to 60 years and then we've got two different curves here so the top curve is uh testing at six in the morning and that's when i whoop does it automatically you know uh last sleep cycle so it's pretty close to 6 a.m so that's the date i'm going to go through today and but then also notice the dashed lines this is heart rate variability for six o'clock at night so taking your heart rate variability in the morning is clearly higher at every time point than taking it at night nonetheless we see that heart rate variability declines during aging from values that are about 75 approaching 80 and 20 year olds to less than half of that in 60 year olds but what about older than 60 year olds so note that this study is was very large this was a 8.2 million fitbit users so once we get past 60 years the studies on age-related trends for heart rate variability get few and far between and uh dramatically smaller in terms of sample size this is a few hundred subjects here with the with the sample size nonetheless when looking at from 10 year olds up to 70 79 year olds we can say that heart rate variability does indeed decline from values of 53 milliseconds to around 19 milliseconds in the 70 to 79 year old group but interestingly the 20 80 to 99 year olds in this study we can see that their heart rate variability was higher than expected based on chronological age which then suggests that higher heart rate variability than expected based on chronological age may be a marker of longevity so once that i'm not saying that based on one study there's more data so let's let's look at data for people older than 99 years for heart rate variability and there's only one study that i know of that's actually looked into this so i would this is far from being a definitive truth a lot more studies are needed this is just a suggestion which may be possible so for the centenarians in this study it was only 17 people too but they had an average age of 102 years we can see that their median heart rate variability again rmssd was 36 milliseconds which was significantly higher than the 84 year olds in this group of 24 milliseconds but not as good obviously as the young adults of about 58 milliseconds so when considering these two studies of people older than 80 having a higher than expected heart rate variability when ex then expected based on their chronological age may be a marker of longevity so to address that question the earlier question is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging now we can address that question we can help answer it so at younger ages we see lower resting heart rates but high heart rate variabilities and advanced ages even though this goes up to 60 i mean in theory this should be up to 80. At advanced age we see you know also low resting heart rates but low heart rate variabilities and then if one can make the argument but you know what about the 80 80 year olds and centenarians that had higher than expected it's still lower than what you would find in someone that's 20 years 20 years old now i've tracked both of these cardiovascular metrics since 2018 so i had 1500 days of data so what does my data look like now just going on the population based averages we'd expect that my resting heart rate should be increasing and my heart rate variability should be should be decreasing so is that true so this is my data for resting heart rate again this is 1500 days of data over the past four years so i'm going to break it down year by year so when i first started tracking my average resting heart rate was about 51 beats per minute and this i've never been sedentary at any point during this process when in 2018 i was actually probably more active than i am now walking 15 to 20 miles a week doing regular strength training weight lifting i mean up to three hours a session once or twice a week so but as we'll see i was i was chronically over trained uh at least based on cardiovascular fitness metrics so then i changed my approach uh you know how often i was training how often i was exercising getting more rest days in and i started to slowly reduce my resting heart rate over time so in 2019 it was 48.9 down from 50.9 and then just rather than looking at the averages we can compare these two groups of data with a two-sample t-test but i'll show that in in a second so 2020 and 2021 i further reduced resting heart rate 48.1 47.4 that's the yearly average and each data point is is a single day's worth of data all right so what about in 2022 so so far in 2022 and this is up through uh last month september september 18th my average for the year for 2022 is about 45 beats per minute and then we can see our which of these values are statistically different or not using a two sample t-test and so comparing two years at a time so we can see that i've significantly significantly reduced my resting heart rate uh when compared with 2018 for each of the years so 2019 first 2018 and going forward we can see that the p-values are significant for so in other words each of these values is significantly lower than where i started and then also i've significantly reduced resting heart rate a year over year while why every year too since 2018. So it isn't just 2019 versus 2018 but 2020 is lower than that 2021 lower than 2020 and 2022 lower than 2021. So consistently i've reduced my resting heart rate over this four year period but is that good or bad because if you remember our lower resting heart rate can be found in youth but also an advanced age so am i just on this am i just on this slope where you know my cardiovascular fitness is just getting worse with time uh so i guess the good news is that i've resisted that age-related increase for resting heart rate but i still don't know yet we still don't know if i'm on this track so how can we assess that so we can by having a look at heart rate variability since 2018. So over that same time period of about 1500 days of data uh so i started with a heart rate variability of 47 milliseconds in 2018 and then increased that significantly increase that uh to 56 milliseconds in 2019 and then uh increased it again in 2020 to 57.8 well increase it when compared with 2018 but not significantly increased when compared with 2019. So both of these years essentially the same in terms of heart rate variability but yeah yeah yeah i don't i don't want to say that it was um i don't want to say that it's it's the device because then that throws into question all of my data but i've never had you see here like i didn't what i didn't do anything different uh you know uh whoop is updated it's algorithm a few times and i don't know if it just if it was a glitch in their software but then again raising that issue makes me think you know can kind of throw down on all of the data i didn't do anything different but this uh these you know random random spots actually now that i think about it some more um my diet back then was not as it's cons it wasn't as consistent as it's been now so i'd have days where it was kind of an every other day fasting approach where i'd eat 5 000 calories and then like 500 calories the next day so by having 500 calories that may have shot my heart rate variability were way up but i i haven't done yeah i'd have to go back and look and see if that was actually true um i'll i'll send you i'll send you a thing i'll look up what i did on those days uh if there's anything that i did that was different but um yeah all right so 2020 and 2019 better than 2018 for um heart rate variability and then uh i had a regression in 2021 so we can see that my heart rate variability went down to about 52 milliseconds and uh that was significantly worse when compared with uh 2020 so year over year worse but still still better than where i started in 2018. So a big focus for 2022 was to get my heart rate variability back on track to resist any potential age-related decline and we can see in 2022 that i've reversed that 2021 trend with my average now at 59.4 milliseconds which is better than where i started in 2018 and also significantly better in uh where it was in 2021 so uh the story for heart rate variability isn't as consistently improved or reduced as for resting heart rate but i've increased it relative to where i started from uh in 2018. So how do these data compare with age-related changes so my expected heart rate variability based on my chronological age is about 35 milliseconds so where where the data was up until september of this year at worst 59 milliseconds is at the high end of the heart rate variability range for my chronological age but at best it could be the median heart rate variability for someone with a uh you know that's 22 years younger so is this contributing to my blood-based biological age data i don't know but uh it's potentially good news all right so then to answer help answer that question is the relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth of eight or aging now that we've seen my heart rate variability data we can answer that question so in my case a relatively high heart rate variability plus a low rested heart rate suggests cv youth whereas what would be expected based on my chronological age would be 35 for heart rate variability and a higher resting heart rate so the cardiovascular fitness metrics look good so what's contributing to these improvements how have i consistently reduced resting heart rate while keeping while having some improvements for heart rate variability so the first for me and arguably the largest impact may be body weight so i in addition to all the things i track i weigh myself every day in the morning also after after using the bathroom uh so when i first started tracking body weight i was around 159 and these are these are not unintentional changes like my goal is always to be as lean as possible so uh measuring body weight helps uh helps with that approach so i'm currently around 151 152 and we can see the ups and downs you know this is the average monthly body weight so each thought is the average for for a month you know it's not it's not stable it's you know we've had some ups and downs there so how does uh body weight relate to resting heart rate so when plotting the resting heart rate the average monthly resting heart rate we you know the the plots kind of look the same and interestingly as body weight decreases my resting heart rate correspondingly decreases during those periods too and conversely during periods where my body weight has increased resting heart rate has also increased now besides looking at trends in in data we can compare to see if they are significantly correlated and that's what we've got here this is the daily resting heart rate so each thought is is a single day's worth of data versus body weight and this is over that same four plus year period 1500 days and here we can see a significant correlation so uh as as body weight is higher that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate you can see a highly significant p-value there and conversely as uh as my body weight uh has gotten closer to 150 pounds i've gotten closer to resting heart rates that are approaching 45 beats per minute so what about heart rate variability so the data for heart rate variability and how it relates to body weight isn't as clear-cut as the resting heart rate for example as body weight has decreased as shown there with flatter lines there are increases for heart rate variability and conversely as body weight has increased there are decreases for heart rate variability and more specifically looking at the correlations for now the daily heart rate variability versus body weight again that four year period 1500 days of data each dot is a single day's worth of data whereas here it's the average monthly data we see a significant inverse correlation so as as my body weight has increased that's significantly correlated with worse heart rate variability and conversely as my body weight has approached 150 pounds my heart rate variability has approached the relatively useful values of 60 milliseconds so i'm currently around here so you know that makes the most sense for the link between body weight and my relatively uh recently high uh hurray variability so in terms of that question what's the relation relationship for body weight with these cardiovascular fitness metrics they both approach youthful values as body weight decreases in my case it may be different for others but this is what my data shows now the other obvious one here is is how does physical activity how does exercise you know because if you exercise you're in a proof cardiovascular fitness that should impact your heart rate variability and resting heart rate so how does that factor in here so for that i'm going to show data on the average daily heart rate which i've designated the adhr and uh that's an index of physical activity so why why why the importance of this metric so i find that a lot of people track steps but the heart rate for walking a thousand steps on flat ground is going to be less than the heart rate for a thousand steps walking up a hill so if you only track steps and not heart rate you're going to miss that whereas by tracking the average daily heart rate that's going to be a measure of your you know overall hearts exertion uh during the day and we could even make it more specific by multiplying body weight times your average daily heart rate as a measure of overall work that your heart has performed but that's an analysis for another another day so a higher average daily heart rate would be more physical activity plus overall stress it isn't it isn't just physical activity that affects your average daily heart rate i mean i've had days unfortunately the well you know we all do where there's some kind of uh stressor whether it's work or whatever and uh heart rate is elevated more than usual for the day sympathetic activation so you can have a relatively high average daily heart rate and just sitting in a chair so i try to minimize that as much as possible but it's uh something we all can avoid all right so what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with the next day resting heart rate so we can see that here and uh unfortunately i didn't start tracking this when i first started tracking all the other metrics but this is 900 days of data for the resting heart rate versus the average daily next day rusty heart rate versus the average daily heart rate for the day before and what we can see is that there's a significant correlation so the higher my average daily heart rate the worse or higher my resting heart rate the next day so that suggests that too much daily activity and too often is going to be bad for the resting heart rate so what about this correlation for average daily heart rate with next morning heart rate variability and we can see that here so here the data is that the higher the average daily heart rate the worse or uh lower the worse or lower that heart rate variability will be so average daily heart rate as that gets higher heart rate variability is lower so there too we see that too much daily activity too often will be bad for heart rate variability so then the the easy answer is finding that balance between activity and rest is important for optimizing resting heart rate and heart rate variability so what that means for me in the real world real world setting so this is a screenshot of one week's worth of data for my average daily heart rate and the active days include my usual workout which is an 80 minute workout uh you know without going into all those details uh and then so after for example after the 59 which included my usual workout i purposely keep my activity levels relatively low on for the next three days after now that doesn't mean sedentary it just means trying to keep overall activity uh lower than where it was on my workout days so that's a four day cycle essentially for workouts so work out three days off my workout full body workout again but i try to stick to a three-day cycle and ideally it's work out and then titrate lower titrate lower hit it hard again so that's what i find works best for me uh i switched to a four day when too much other life stress and you know work stress and overall physical activity gets in the way and then so i'll have sub-optimal cardiovascular fitness metrics so by taking that extra day of rest it helps them recover so that when i do a workout i don't you know kill my metrics basically chronically all right so what about weaknesses in my data i mean i don't want to make this seem like it's all it's all all gold stars and that there aren't areas to improve so two of those may include dhea sulfate and the oral microbiome so uh to address are there weaknesses in my data let's highlight total a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter so what's optimal for total cholesterol so here we're looking at all cause mortality data for total class or all cause mortality there and the wax is plotted against total cholesterol on the x and this is uh in a study of 45 to 54 year olds that the age range isn't perfectly overlapping and this is in the supplementary data so technically it's 44 to 55 year olds but it's data for more than 3.3 million subjects and what we can see is that when compared with the referent which was 220 to 229 my 133 for total cholesterol and test number five would put me at a more than two-fold increased all-cause mortality risk so obviously superficially that's that's not good so what about uh age-related changes how does total cholesterol change during aging so total low total cholesterol is found in youth as shown there but and then it peaks in about midlife approximately there for both men and women i should say men in green and the women in red but then if we extrapolate the curves out beyond uh this this age range goes up to 88 years if we extrapolate out to older than that centenarian data shows that they also have relatively low levels of total cholesterol as shown there so um we've kind of got this story again with you know how can we lo how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging so low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with decreased all-cause mortality risk and that's what i'm going to go through here so relative risk for all-cause mortality and then this is people who had low total cholesterol so less than 160 and then varying levels of albumin alb and hdl cholesterol so note that this is you know unfortunately almost all of the studies on all cause mortality for cholesterol do not adjust their models for uh malnutrition with albumin being one factor involved in that so whether this is the the larger story that's just uh less widely studied uh or just an anomaly there's no way to know but in this relatively small study of about 400 people this is what the data shows so we'll compare with that hazard ratio of one again i mentioned this earlier when that confidence interval is completely below we have statistical significance and when it overlaps it's not significant so the highest all-cause mortality risk in this study was low total cholesterol low albumin so less than 38 and low hdl less than 47. And then what if you had higher hdl in the context of those other biomarkers so higher hdl did not impact all cause mortality risk when there was low total cholesterol and low albumin so what about if albumin levels were relatively high so in this case higher than 38 grams per deciliter and this is i've designated this as the close to youthful phenotype and that's because low total cholesterol is found in youth relatively high albumin is also found in youth so it for someone to have an abdomen of 48 is is going to be a low probability for someone that's you know an advanced age whereas 48 is what's found in youth so having low total cholesterol and relatively high albumin is quickly close to youthful phenotype and what we can see is that relative to someone who has low total cholesterol low abdomen low hdl those people had a 32 percent decrease all-cause mortality risk so then it gets a little better for those who had relatively high abdomen and relatively high hdl which hdl also declines during aging so low total cholesterol high albumin high hdl would be variables you could you'd be expected to find more often than not or with a higher probability in younger people relative to older people and in that case that would be the youthful phenotype and we see a 62 percent decreased all-cause mortality risk for that group so how does this combination compare then with the higher total cholesterol you know if you remember we've got that 220 to 229 range for lowest all-cause mortality risk and that was actually compared in this study all cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against the about a six year follow-up and then we've got those three different groups for cholesterol relatively high intermediate and then less than less than 160 but the youthful phenotype high relatively high albumin and relatively high hdl and now the mortality curves are overlapping they were not significantly different so what that basically summarizes is that someone who's got very low total cholesterol like me it doesn't have to be an increased all-cause mortality risk that the key is to the key may be again this isn't settled science there need to be a bunch more studies on this um the key may be having you know the youthful phenotype which would be relatively high albumen and my hdl isn't there yet but 44 isn't too far away from the 47 in this study so accordingly i'm not worried about total cholesterol being a weakness in my data but i do have relatively relatively low levels of dhea sulfate as shown there on the august test now note that dhea sulfate is the most abundant circulating steroid and people just to highlight its importance without going into all of the pathways and mechanisms that it's involved in now if i only focused on the reference range i'd miss this as a potential weakness in my data that reference range is very wide 61 to 442 micrograms per deciliter so dhea sulfate levels decline during aging we can see that here they peak at around 20 years old and then they decline now putting my data into that this chart we can see that i'd be relatively low for my age group and actually low for every age group based on this most recent data now i do have earlier data going back to 2005 i measured twice 17 years ago and back then it was uh you know 300 micrograms per deciliter so i have experienced a decline now whether that's an age-related decline or it's a deficiency in my diet somewhere that'll be uh you know that that'll be to be determined now having a dhea sulfate level where mine currently is is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so we've got all cause mortality risks there on the y-axis and this is a 27 year follow-up so for people that had dhea sulfate levels that were less than 129 increased law cause mortality risk when compared with relatively youthful levels which were higher than uh 200 200 in this study so one could make the argument it's just one test you know test more often for dhea sulfate and see where your data is and maybe it's not actually low but so to address that i used at-home blood testing which i think is going to be the future of health optimization and that's because you can collect a relatively large amount of data in a short period of time so even with my six to seven or eight blood tests per year which is a lot more than most people do i could get six to eight tests in tests tests worth of data in two weeks if i could do it by fingerprint rather than one year so with that in mind i blood tested 12 times using fingerprint within two months and i used this company here as their mission is to radically increase human lifespan so uh what's my data so here are those 12 blood tests from july to august of this year and we can see that my average dhea sulfate by finger prick was about 120 micrograms per deciliter which is right in the ballpark of my 129 uh for the august test so then the question is how will i increase it how will i essentially reverse the age-related trend if it is an age-related trend and get it back to where i had it in youth so if you mention if you remember i started the story with cholesterol so what does cholesterol have to do with dhea sulfate so dhea sulfate is produced by cholesterol degradation as shown here so cholesterol is degraded to pregnenolone and these are enzymatic reactions that happen in the adrenal in the adrenal adrenal glands which i'm sure everybody here knows located on top of the kidney so cholesterol is degraded to pregnenolone which is hydroxylated to 17 hydroxy pregnenolone which is then converted into dhea which is then converted into dhega sulfate so four enzymatic steps cholesterol to dhea sulfate now if the relatively low dhe is sulfate was because of my relatively low dietary cholesterol and correspondingly low total cholesterol and blood i'd expect that cortisol and testosterone would also be low and that's because cortisol is produced by the degradation of pregnenolone as shown there and then testosterone is produced by the degradation of dhea sulfate as shown there so what's my data so for that we go back to the 12 blood tests using the at-home finger prick blood testing we'll start with cortisol and just to note cortisol there it's a bit debatable on age-related changes in this in this study of about 4 800 people there is a small significant increase in cortisol during aging nonetheless mine were pretty much midpoint i mean nothing uh spectacular there but i did have earlier data and that was a bit higher now what's optimal for cortisol um that also is a bit debatable i mean all-cause mortality data is there isn't a definitive story there it goes uh both ways so it may not be a good biomarker in terms of chronological age and all-cause mortality risk nonetheless i do have a decline there which suggests that add support to this hypothesis that maybe it's a limitation of dietary and total cholesterol so what about testosterone so over to those same 12 blood tests we're putting my average data of 19.4 nanomolars into context and actually before that testosterone follows the same story as dhea sulfate increases peaks in about youth 20 years old and then the clients so my data there isn't actually low at all it is lower than where it was in a on one test in 2005 which suggests that maybe i do have some age-related change going on for adrenal function which is uh wise that's suggested it there so when considering that these hormones are produced by degradation of cholesterol the first step would be in my opinion to increase cholesterol with the intention of increasing my dhea sulfate so how can i do that how can i increase blood levels of cholesterol so for that i go to go to the correlations between diet with my blood biomarkers and in my case the the nutrient that is most strongly correlated with blood cholesterol blood levels of cholesterol is indeed dietary cholesterol now i know that there are plenty of published studies saying that dietary cholesterol doesn't impact blood levels of cholesterol and as we'll see in a minute that may actually be true this may actually be correlation and not causation but in terms of the my own data the strongest correlation is for dietary cholesterol impacting or being correlated with at least blood levels of cholesterol so for test number five in 2022 i my i had my lowest intake of dietary cholesterol or around there 24 milligrams per day uh so i had some room to to increase it so but then as i mentioned earlier if i increase my dietary cholesterol considering it has a score of minus eight uh as shown here without going through all that again but it the score is minus eight will i increase will i improve my total cholesterol level but make a whole bunch of other biomarkers worse so when the score is minus eight that suggests i should eat above my average intake my average dietary cholesterol intake is 126 milligrams per day so when considering i was at 24 milligrams per day for dietary intake i've got some wiggle room there where i can still stick to these rules for the correlations without going too high and messing thing uh potentially a whole bunch of other biomarkers up so i started that approach and i started to increase my cholesterol intake uh not too high though uh so 92 milligrams per day with the goal of increasing potentially increasing blood cholesterol and increasing dhea sulfate but not messing up anything else and without going through that in in this video i posted that video on my youtube channel a while back with four days of data with a relatively higher dietary cholesterol so basically nine fold higher i mean this is my average intake here the next day for dhea sulfate it didn't increase so the long story short there is i increased dietary cholesterol i didn't see a change in dhea sulfate but just to add a little a little bit more depth there as i was saying about this correlation with dietary cholesterol with blood cholesterol uh a higher dietary cholesterol you know up to 220 milligrams per day didn't actually increase my blood cholesterol so that i didn't see an effect for dietary cholesterol intake on dhea sulfate it may not be settled there because i wasn't actually able to increase my total levels of cholesterol so nonetheless i'm going to have to go through some other means to try to figure out how to increase my dhea sulfate at least for now that don't involve dietary cholesterol intake so what about the oral microbiome is that a weakness too so oral bacteria and i mentioned that because it's not on the blood-based biomarkers what if what if changes in the mouth can precede changes that happen in blood and if i'm not paying attention to oral health whether it's through you know gum inflammation or uh cavity risk or periodontitis uh if i'm not paying attention to that maybe it'll crop up with advanced age and then the systemic biomarkers will start to get worse so to help check that box and avoid that from happening tracking my oral microbiome is now in in the approach and that's because oral bacteria have been linked with multiple adverse health conditions as shown there so beyond stuff in the mouth like uh involved with cavity formation or uh dental root infections periodontal disease oral bacteria have also been linked with atherosclerotic plaques pneumonia rheumatoid arthritis and then autoimmune conditions like sjogren's syndrome and lupus so how can we optimize oral oral bacterial composition so the first step is quantification and i used a company bristle is shown there so just going through my overall bacterial composition i decided to put the post the full stuff there if anyone's interested in how it breaks down this is 98.3 percent of it 1.7 percent didn't fit on the slide so then uh we're going from in relative abundance so highest amount at the top and then lowest all the way here at the bottom so are any of these bacteria linked with oral and or systemic health so the first start is what's associated with oral health uh so what's been shown to be associated with oral health are two genera nysaria and rothia as shown their green arrows and when i sum those data i've got about half 53 and this is my first oral microbiome test i won't have the time to go into test number two but this was the data for my first test so about half of my oral microbiome has uh 53 percent the quote-unquote good or good oral health related bacteria now is 53 optimal i mean this is a like a huge black box right now in the field you know most of the microbiome science is in the gut very little of it is in uh you know the oral microbiome especially even less uh you know uh published studies on rcts that can improve or oral microbiome uh composition so um so yeah my eyes are on that field to see uh what it will have to say about uh you know what's an optimal amount for both of these levels is 53 53 sufficient should it be 60 should it be 45 uh stay tuned for that so how does how does my oral bacterial composition compare with bacteria that have been linked with oral and systemic health so we can go back here so in terms of cavity formation the good news is i don't have any streptococcus mutants in my data or in fact any cav any bacterium that are related to cavity formation so the question then is why so i use a homemade mouthwash commercially available mouthwashes i won't name names but many of them have phs that are higher than or actually lower than 5.5 which we'll see is the critical value for cavity formation so with that in mind i make a homemade mouthwash that contains xylitol so how much xylitol do i put in there so growth of uh one of the cavity uh forming or that's been shown one of the bacteria that's been shown to form uh be related to cavity formation streptococcus mutants uh growth of that bacterium is limited in the presence of one percent xylitol which is what we can see here so we're looking at log growth right here so higher levels would be higher levels of the bacterium lower levels lower levels of the bacterium so when compared up with controls going going higher levels of xylitol we can see lower levels of of bacterial growth uh so such that with the largest amount of xylitol one percent as shown there actually one percent here would be that's the law growth there so that's a 76 result 76 reduction for this uh bacterium in the presence of one percent solitaire so this is just one strain of streptococcus mutants there are many other strains of that bacterium so uh just to show that xylitol is efficacious against those other strains of the same bacterium that's what i'm showing here those are the strains starting with the strain i just showed so 76 percent uh reduction in the presence of one percent xylitol but then also pretty good reduction with these other strains of the same bacteria so 61 to 76 percent by having one percent xylitol in the mouthwash so with these data in mind i include one gram of xylitol per 100 ml of water in the homemade mouthwash so what else is in that mouthwash so uh to illustrate what else is in it uh let's go through oral acidity and how it contributes to tooth decay so we're looking at plaque ph there and then uh time after glucose rinse at time zero so for the person who has active cavity formation after the glucose rinse their oral ph rapidly declines to that below the critical ph of 5.5 where this is now where there's a higher risk for cavity formation when it's below that so for the person who has carries active uh going on there they they rapidly decline to below 5.5 and you can see by the red area under the curve they stay there for a long time too so they have a slow recovery to get out of the carries active zone for someone that has inactive cavity formation the oral ph after the glucose rinse goes below 5.5 but relatively rapidly gets out of that region pretty fast and then for the person who cares cares resistant even after the glucose rinse they never get below 5.5 and then they have a rapid recovery to close to physiological ph in the mouth around seven after that so to limit these oral ph drops below 5.5 i add sodium bicarbonate which is a base one gram per 100 mils which is pretty close to physiological saline or the concentration of physiological saline to the homemade mouthwash so all right what else is in that mouthwash then so p gingivalis has been linked with a bunch of adverse health related conditions both inside and outside of the mouth as shown there and for test number one i did indeed have a small amount of this bacterium that's been shown to be related to each of the conditions in red so 0.2 percent of my total bacteria were from pigeon to valles now peppermint oil has been shown in vitro studies to inhibit the growth of this bacterium so also in the mouthwash is a couple of drops of peppermint oil per per thousand mils and i've since increased it to three to four drops for test number two and uh without going into that data i was actually able to reduce or eliminate uh so from point two to zero which is good news potentially good news so in terms of what's good i have no streptococcus mutants which are linked with cavity formation relatively low levels of pigeon devalis and then relatively high levels of those oral health related bacteria necessaria and rothia but what's not good so for for the first test i had salivary levels in this case that were greater than 0.2 percent of total bacteria that were linked with adverse oral and or systemic health and i've indicated them there so then how could i reduce levels of at least some of these bacteria so a study was published in 2020 that has indicated that nitrate may be a potential prebiotic for the oral microbiome and for those who may not know a prebiotic is is are are things that feed already existing bacteria thereby enabling their growth so starting with a diet rich in nitrate there's a direct effect where nitrate from the food is in the mouth and nitrate in the mouth will then be consumed by these nitrate reducing bacteria so you get growth of the nitrate reducing bacteria like nessaria and rothia in the mouth and then there's an indirect effect of eating a diet rich in nitrate where you get an increase in plasma levels of nitrate that concentrates in the parotid gland and other salivary glands which then secrete nitrate into the mouth thereby enabling the whole process of increased nitrate reducing bacteria so how does nitrate impact the oral microbiome and this was done in saliva from 12 uh healthy donors which was then incubated with nitrate and then what happened to the oral microbiome composition so that's we're looking at there on the y-axis and this was five and nine hours after saliva was incubated with nitrate and what they saw was were a significant increase for the oral health related bacteria in this area and rothia in the presence of nitrate and then significant reductions for caries and halitosis related bacteria in the presence of nitrate and for others that that i have you know greater than 0.2 percent uh amounts of like the two indicated there treponema and tannerella they weren't significant but they're trending in the right direction at least when considering it was a small study of 12 people so then the question is if i want to further improve my oral microbiome health how can i increase or oral nitrate so with the goal of optimizing oral bacterial composition should i eat more nitrate consuming foods and that's because as we saw it diet rich and nitrate stimulates this increase in oral oral nitrate levels now i'm already on a high nitrate diet though and we can see that here these are foods that i commonly consume and then they're nitrate content and because i track my diet and weigh everything with the food scale i know exactly how much of these foods that i was eating for the two-month period before my oral microbiome test and since we know the nitrate content of these foods i can calculate how much nitrate i'm getting from each of these foods on a daily basis and then take the sum and we can see that my average nitrate intake is close to 1900 at least for this test it was close to 1900 milligrams per day so to put that in context what's been recommended as an acceptable daily intake for nitrate is three points is 3.7 3.7 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day so for my close to current body weight of 69 kilograms an acceptable daily intake for nitrate would be about 256 milligrams per day so i'm you know seven to eight times higher based on uh what's considered an acceptable intake so i'm already on a high nitrate diet it doesn't make sense to further increase that uh through diet which then goes to the targeted supplementation approach of of adding it to the mouthwash so for the second test uh after the first test i added potassium nitrate to that homemade mouthwash which then the question becomes how much nitrate and how often so how much is is unknown you know uh there are no published rcts on giving potassium nitrate to uh you know to human volunteers and then tracking their microbiome over time now what was in this in vitro study where they incubated the saliva with potassium nitrate i went with four grams of potassium nitrate per 1000 mils which was 64 millimolar which was 10 times higher than the concentration used in the in vitro study and again i who knows how much is optimal that's what i started with so then in terms of how much nitrate and how often like how often should uh the mouthwash be used independent of okay i just ate a meal i'm going to floss and then gargle so i don't have any oral acidity that that's the easy uh the easy obvious answer but aside from that how much and how often uh so here we're looking at nitrate levels after the saliva was incubated with nitrate and you can see immediately after the saliva was incubated with nitrate there was a big increase here relative to no nitrate but then after five hours of nitrate being added you can see almost all of it has been consumed and then nine hours after incubating saliva with nitrate it's all been consumed so um using the mouthwash once every five hours or nine hours at the latest uh was my approach going from test number one to test number two so then the question is did the levels of nitrate reducing bacteria further increase and levels of the quote-unquote bad bacteria decrease so for the test number update test number two update and again i won't have time to go through all that data here i did make a second video for that and that too was on my youtube youtube channel i have a kit that i'm ready to do test number three but that'll be coming up probably in about a month so for the test number two i i actually having this much nitrate in my mouthwash didn't increase my levels of nitrate reducing bacteria in fact it decreased from 53 to 43 46 percent so how i could have more nitrate in the mouthwash but not impact levels of nitrate reducing bacteria suggests that i've already maximized my levels of nitrate reducing bacteria with my high nitrate diet and then as i mentioned i was able to uh eliminate at least for this test uh pigeon devalis whether that was because of the peppermint oil or something else i don't know i i was able to reduce levels of bacteria related to gum inflammation but then about five percent five point five percent somewhere in that range of my uh oral bacteria are related to halitosis and i wasn't able to impact that and i can't imagine anybody would want to have bad breath related bacteria so that's a work in progress so uh put that in mind i'm ready for more questions if anybody hasn't so yeah logic goes it goes why not use a product like neo40 or just eat a bunch of beans a big question one question two is it could be something in your mouthwashing up for the bacteria creating nitric oxide get something even in your homemade mouthwasher killing the bacteria and maybe negatively impacting your nitric oxide yeah right so to answer the first question um if i'm so the commercially available mouthwashes that some of them that do have nitrate or other stuff that's been shown to impact oral health um it gets expensive very quickly uh most of those products are like ten dollars i'd probably go through a relatively small bottle in two or three days i mean ten dollars might not seem like much but i'm not trying to spend you know 400 a year or more on mouthwash when i can probably make it at home uh with the same ingredients or even better put the ingredients in there that i that i that may be targeted um now it's your second question that's a that's a great point i caught my nitrate in the mouthwash down from four grams per day to two grams for the next test because that is possible it's possible that i can get to super physiological doses and now i'm i'm actually you know uh suppressing levels of uh what somehow i'm messing up the system by going super physiological um but uh from the first test to the second test it was mostly the same i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't state the conclusion that having too much nitrate completely blew up the system uh but that it didn't improve at least the nitrate reducing bacteria uh argues that i can reduce it and i don't know eliminate it what's interesting and this is completely anecdotal i have i had white lines on the inside of my cheeks that i would bite for a very long time and we're talking decades i mean i remember my dentist in my 20s saying do you bite the inside of your cheeks and i don't know if that was cause or consequence was i biting it because i had some something there it's called linea alba was i biting it because that was there or did i create it by biting it right so after i started with the nitrate supplementation they it went away so i don't want to get rid of it yet uh i'm not ready to make the conclusion that having that there has messed up the whole composition because the when looking at it by percentages you know uh gum inflammation and periodontitis and all the other bacteria most of that stayed pretty close to the same with some small improvements uh so having nitrate there there didn't blow up the system is i guess to answer the question i guess my worry would be taking anything that right just not using mouthwash at all just brushing your teeth every day and then maybe taking the do 40 or the beans maybe you could achieve some of the health gains i mean i don't know it's all no it's it's a definite possibility uh i'm completely open to it it doesn't have to be the mouthwash uh in theory i should have some data i should generate some data without the mouthwash just tooth brushing and you know a couple hours later with water rinsing or whatever just to see what it looks like without it right so yeah i i expect just like the blood test data i expect to have you know a considerable number of oral microbiome tests to really see what does i mean this is still early stages two data points you know so but with enough data too i'll be able to see should it be more beats should it be more nitrate is it something i need to do locally with a mouthwash right so uh yeah great points you uh did you test your nitric oxide levels i've thought about that though but no not yet not yet all right got it all right thanks everybody [music] [applause]
