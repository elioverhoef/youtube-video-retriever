If the goal is longevity age products may be a problem feeding age products to mice on a calorie restricted diet cr shortens lifespan and we can see that data here so we're looking at cumulative survival on the y-axis plotted against longevity or lifespan on the x and we can see that mice that were subjected to 40 calorie restricted had a significant extension of lifespan now note that calories and age products are reduced on the calorie restricted diet and we can see that here so when comparing the regular diet reg versus cr up we can see that food intake on the cr diet in grams per day was 3 grams per day versus 5 on the regular diet so a 40 restriction of food intake and that resulted in a 40 reduction in calorie intake for cr mice but also notice for the age product cml which stands for n6 carboxy methyl lysine we can see that this age product cml was 37 percent less on the cr diet because they ate less food when compared with the regular diet so is it the calories that's leading to the extension of lifespan and cr mice or is it the age products so to test that the authors of this study then added age products more specifically cml and and others uh into the food so does that affect lifespan so first let's look at the dietary composition for mice that were fed the high age product diet as shown there so first we can see that food intake and calorie intake were similar exact you know exactly similar to what cr mice cr mice ate but we can see that age products on the cr high diet were almost three fold higher than mice that were on cr and also higher than on the regular diet so what was the effect on lifespan for cr mice that ate the same amount of food as regular crm ice but that a higher had had a higher age product level in their diet and we can see that the lifespan extension for cr mice is gone so age products feeding age products to mice even on a cr diet shortens lifespan conversely reducing dietary age products increases lifespan and we can see that data here so once again looking at cumulative survival on the y-axis plotted against lifespan or longevity uh in age or weeks we can see that mice were fed a regular age product containing diet in the tr in the rectangles and then a low age diet in the triangles and we can see that mice that were fed the low age product diet had a significant extension of lifespan so are dietary age products related to health or longevity in people because these data are in mice we want to know if this can improve health and longevity potentially longevity in people so there weren't any pretty pictures to present so we can get all the information we need from the title of this paper dietary intake of cml is not associated with an increased risk of mortality in this study of 29 000 people so does that mean that dietary age products are irrelevant for human health now note that this is only one study if anyone's come across all-cause mortality data as it associates with dietary intake of age products please leave it in the comments below but i haven't come across that data only one study so far now conversely in contrast blood levels of cml increase during aging we can see that here so uh blood levels of cml on the y-axis plotted against age from the 35 to 85 year old age range and we can see that age products the age product cml significantly increases in blood during aging so uh what's the importance of the uh higher relatively higher levels of age products that are found in blood you know during aging so relatively higher blood levels of cml are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so first we're looking at uh win uh data for women and these are older adult women from 65 to older than 90 years so we're looking at survival or all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis and with about a five-year follow-up on the x so we can see that older adult women that were in the lowest three quartiles of cml blood levels so less than 0.68 micrograms per milliliter had improved survival when compared with women that had uh higher than uh great or greater than 0.68 micrograms per ml for cml so relatively high blood levels of cml in this study of older adult women were survival increased all-cause mortality risk so what about data for women and men so both genders so again we're looking at all-cause mortality or survival on the y-axis and in this case in this study the uh the follow-up time was longer up to about seven years and again we're looking at 65 to older than 90-year-olds so for people that were in the lowest two tertials of cml in blood so in this case less than point four micrograms per milliliter they had improved survival whereas the highest tertile of cml in blood greater than point four micrograms per ml had an increase all-cause mortality risk when compared with the lower two to two tertiles of cml so what's contributing to the higher circulating cml in older adults even if we discount the role of diet what's contributing to the higher blood levels of cml in older adults so first note that cml is increased in the presence of high blood sugar or hyperglycemia so uh in this study they used a hyperglycemia clamp and what that means is that they infused glucose that increased it from basal levels of 90 milligrams per deciliter up to 180 for two hours so blood glucose was 180 for a two hour period continuously so what was the effect on blood levels of cml so after two hours we can see that cml levels in blood were significantly increased as a result of the glucose infusion up to 180 milligrams per deciliter so that's only one study let's look at data from another study so in this study they did a 24 hour infusion i should note that both of these data are in humans not mice so in this study it was a 24-hour glucose infusion and again they raised basal levels of glucose from 95 milligrams per deciliter up to 192 so very elevated blood levels of glucose for a 24-hour period so what was the effect on blood levels of cml so we can see that data here starting from a basal level of cml in blood of 74 nanomolar after two hours it wasn't significantly increased but after 24 hours of continuous glucose infusion we can see that cml levels were significantly increased when compared with the basal levels so from these two studies we can see that cml is significantly increased in the presence of high glucose now note that 180 plus milligrams per deciliter is very high it's nowhere near the age-related increase for blood glucose so with that in mind are age-related increases for blood glucose enough to increase blood levels of cml now i wasn't a i didn't come across those studies but if anyone out there has seen those studies please post them in the comments um so we can you know educate everybody about what happens with the age-related increase for blood glucose and its potential effect on blood cml now blood glucose isn't the only factor that can increase blood levels of cml poor kidney function may also contribute and note that kidney function declines during aging which may be one reason for an increased level of cml in blood during aging so here we can see the association for cml again n6 carboxymethyl lysine with egfr as an index of kidney function so we can see that that association is inverse or negative which means that the higher the blood levels of cml the worse kidney function as indicated there now there weren't any pretty pictures in that in the in this study of people who had an average age of about 48 years in a second we'll look at people who are older but in the simplified schematic of what that negative or inverse association would look like i've plotted a a standard negative association there with egfr as kidney function on the y-axis against cml on the x-axis so we can see with a negative or an inverse association higher levels of cml would be associated with a worse egfr or worse kidney function and conversely lower levels of cml would be associated with a higher egfr or better kidney function so that's what the negative or inverse association indicates now in another study of older adults in this case with a median age of 64 years and again we're looking at the association for serum levels of cml versus egfr we can again see this negative association so in these two separate studies we can see that the higher blood levels of cml were associated with worse kidney function now hyperglycemia and poor kidney function or sub-optimal kidney function aren't the only factors that can contribute to blood levels of cml the gut microbiome may also contribute so here in this study mice were force-fed cml and then cml and blood was quantified four hours later which is what we're looking at on the y-axis blood levels of cml or the change in cml starting from baseline and in this case we're looking at uh data for young mice that were one to two months old so very young versus age mice 22 to 24 months old and also notice there are two different uh shades for these bars there's the light shading which are spf's specific pathogen-free mice so mice that have a defined microbiome versus the purple bars of the purple rectangles which are germ-free mice mice that don't have a microbiome so in young mice regardless if the mice had a microbiome or not we can see that there are similar levels of cml and blood however during aging we can see that aged microbiome containing mice have increased levels of cml and blood whereas the mice that don't have a microbiome did not have a significant increase for uh during aging for cml so where did the cml go in the mice that didn't have a microbiome remember this this is cml that's force-fed where did it go so the ingested cml was not absorbed into into the systemic circulation in mice that didn't have a microbiome and we can see that here so we're looking at cml content and in this case it isn't blood it's in the fecal pellet so we're looking at data for uh the mice that have microbiome on the left versus mice that did not have a microbiome on the right and this is in the aged mice and in the germ-free mice the animals that did not have a microbiome we can see a four-fold higher content of cml in the poop when compared with the animals that had a microbiome so again the ingested cml in the microbiome absent mice was not absorbed it was it was retained in the fecal pellet so then the big question is why so there's worse gut berry function in aged microbiome containing mice when compared with the germ-free mice the mice that did not have a microbiome and we can start to see that here so here we're looking at relative permeability and this is permeability of fitc dextrand so that's a fluorescent probe so that is a force fed and then it's absorbed and how much of that is absorbed is reflective of how permeable the intestine is or how good or bad gut barrier function is so in young mice we can see that uh that relative permeability of the intestine is similar whether the mice have a microbiome or they don't so but then as uh the mice age especially mice that have a microbiome uh or more specifically mice to have a microbiome have an age-related increase for worse gut barrier function or an increase in intestinal permeability as shown by that red arrow however for the mice that do not have a microbiome we can see that there's no age-related increase for intestinal permeability so the same gut berry function in mice that don't have a gut microbiome so with that in mind interventions that improve gut barrier function should reduce absorption of cml into the blood so that's what we're going to look at here so relative permeability of the intestine and in this case mice were supplemented the aged mice were supplemented with iap and iap stands for intestinal alkaline phosphatase it's a protein uh and so what happened after iap supplementation then the h minus two intestinal probability so as we can see by that green arrow it's significantly improved so iap improves intestinal permeability so then what what happened to blood levels of cml in aged iap supplemented mice so we can see that here levels of blood levels of cml after the age mice were force-fed and in iap supplemented mice we can see that cml levels in blood were significantly reduced so with that in mind how can we increase iap that seems like it's a very important protein for reducing blood levels of cml and i've covered iap in a in an earlier video if you're interested in that data i'll leave a link in the right corner so check it out all right to summarize dietary age products impact lifespan in mice and then dietary age products are not associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in people but there's only one study uh that that that exists so if more studies are definitely needed to come to that conclusion as a more definitive conclusion however blood levels of cml definitely increase during aging and blood cml levels are also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk now blood levels of cml are increased independent of the dietary story in the presence of high glucose when kidney function is poor and also when gut barrier function intestinal permeability is high or gut berry function is poor so note that interventions more specifically iap that improve gut barrier function lead to less blood levels of cml all right that's all from all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
