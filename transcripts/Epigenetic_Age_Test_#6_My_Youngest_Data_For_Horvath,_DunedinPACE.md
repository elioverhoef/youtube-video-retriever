## Transcript

What's my epigenetic age the best clock for predicting epigenetic age is the horvath clock and we'll go through that data in a minute but the horvath clock may not be best for evaluating the epigenetic rate of aging in contrast dunedin pace is potentially the best epigenetic clock for predicting the epigenetic rate of aging so with these data in mind for epigenetic test number six what's my data and to assess that i sent blood to true diagnostic and for those who are interested there'll be a discount link in the video's description so let's start off by taking a look at horvath data so why is horvath's clock considered the best for predicting chronological age and that's what we'll see here on the y-axis we've got dna m or dna methylation age otherwise known as epigenetic age and you can see in parentheses is the horvath or horvath clock and this is plotted against chronological age from birth up to 100 years old and then there are many different colored circles on this plot this is a multi-tissue clock and there we can see the significant and strong correlation for the horvath epigenetic age with chronological age more specifically we can see that that correlation is 0.94 now note that a perfectly linear correlation is when that correlation coefficient is one so that's why horvath's clock is considered the best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age because its correlation is so close to a perfectly linear correlation of one now note that the horvath clock is also known as intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration or iea and that's how true diagnostic sends that data as the intrinsic age so with that in mind what's my data so for the test number six in april of 2023 we can see that my intrinsic age or horvath age was 50.78 years which may seem pretty bad because that's one year rounded up more specifically 0.55 years older than my chronological age but note that this is my lowest horvath epigenetic age data over six tests which then raises the question which factors may be related to a youthful more youthful or older horvath age and with that in mind the most obvious bet that i would think at least based on the data in terms of correlations is the average daily body weight and this is six six data points over the past two years 2022 to 2023. So on the y-axis we've got the iea or horvath epigenetic age plotted against the average daily body weight in pounds and note that this isn't the body weight on the day of the test if there are 50 days in between tests it's the 50-day average body weight that then corresponds to test number two and i do that for every test so i have a body weight and actually food intake and a whole bunch of other variables that line up with each blood test and that's how i'm able to evaluate correlations so for this plot we can see a significant positive correlation in other words a relatively higher body weight in my case may not be true for others and this is only six data points it may change over time a relatively higher body weight is significantly correlated with an older horvath epigenetic age which then raises the question what will happen if i'm able to further reduce my body weight and note that this is almost exclusively a fat reduction as i'm not trying to lose any lean mass or any skeletal muscle mass what will happen to my epigenetic horvath epigenetic age if i'm able to get to 145 and even below and so my body composition at about 151 pounds was 12 body fat so based on that assuming i haven't lost any muscle i'm currently about nine percent body fat so i can get to about 140 that would be six percent body fat so i do have some room to lose some fat to test this correlation for body weight with horvath epigenetic aid so stay tuned for that in future videos all right so what about foods foods that are significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age and note that i included all foods for this all the foods that i eat for this analysis and no foods were significantly correlated with an older epigenetic age in terms of foods significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age there were only two and that's we can see here with parsley and tomato so let's just go through it so the little r lowercase r is the correlation coefficient and note that the correlation coefficient is negative which suggests that a relatively higher intake of these foods is significantly correlated with a younger horvath epigenetic age we can see that the p-value as a measure of statistical significance with 0. Less than 0.05 being a significant correlation and note that i didn't account for false the false discovery rate fdr so these could be true positives but they could also be false positives and the best way that i think to evaluate that is by increasing parsley or increasing tomato and if the correlations are indeed cause a i'd expect to see a younger horvath epigenetic age in that case by going higher if the if the horvath epigenetic age doesn't get younger with higher intakes of these foods the correlations will then become weaker and that's how i can get at testing causation all right so then i've got the intake range and then my intake for the last test so based on these inverse correlations that suggests i should go higher relatively higher with the goal of reducing the horvath epigenetic age again if correlation equals causation and we can see just using parsley as an example that that was true the high intake of my range for parsley is about 51 grams for my last list that's where it was and similarly for tomatoes high intake of my range about 118 grams per day for the last test that's exactly what i took in so i'm following the correlations with the goal of using try to use food body weight and everything else try to keep my horvath epigenetic age low all right next up the need and pace so first why don't need in peace now dunedin pace as i mentioned earlier donated pace may be the best epigenetic clock for evaluating the epigenetic aging rate and i covered this in more detail in an earlier video that i'll i'll link in the right corner so if you missed that analysis uh check it out but let's just go through a relatively quick run through to see why this may be true so on the y-axis of these two plots we've got the change in two different epigenetic clocks change in horvath and change in another epigenetic clock hanum that's provided by true diagnostic that i've shown in earlier videos but i won't go through that data in this video so the change in these two epigenetic clocks in people who are on an ad-lib diet al or a calorie restricted diet cr and more specifically it was 12 cr that was sustained over a two-year period so accordingly there are three time points baseline after 12 months on a cr diet or 24 months or actually on a cr or the ad-lib diet now for both these epigenetic clocks we can see that neither identified a significant reduction in epigenetic aging over that two-year period whether using the horvath or the hantum clock and s means not significant similarly two other gold standard epigenetic clocks levine's phenowage and this isn't the blood-based biomarker one that i'm always showing this is the epigenetic version of that clock so levine's pheno age and grimage those tests too were not able to detect a significant reduction in epigenetic aging for people on cr when compared with ad-lib but where it gets interesting is that dunedin pace was able to identify a difference and we can see that both at the 12 and 24 month time points in other words dunedin pace was the only epigenetic clock of these five to identify a slower epigenetic pace of aging for people on cr for two years now this is just one study one one head-to-head study and as far as i know there aren't others that have looked at head to head dunedin pace against all the other epigenetic age epigen epigenetic age clocks so i'm curious to see how this story plays out if dunedin pace will be identified as the one that's only able to identify epigenetic aging changes as a result of a given intervention or if other clocks will prove to be better but at least for now and based on this one study epigenetic the dunedin pace may be the best epigenetic clock for evaluating the epigenetic aging rate so with that in mind what's my data so for the april 24th test my dunedin pace value was 0.76 so what does that mean the slowest epigenetic aging rate using dunedin pace would be 0.6 and what that means is for every one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years conversely 1.4 is the fastest epigenetic aging rate so for every year one year of chronological age epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years so my dunedin pays value for this test of 0.76 indicates that for every one year of chronological aging i have aged 0.76 years or more specifically i have a standard normal epigenetic aging rate up until about september early september and then for the last three and a half months or so of the year there's no epigenetic aging that's another way to look at it a little cutesy way to look at that that data now this is just one test how does this test compare with previous tests so we can have more context so for the three tests in 2022 my average dunedin pace was 0.837 and thus far in 2023 over three tests my average is 0.777 and when using a two sample t-test the difference for these two years in terms of donating a pace is right at the border of statistical significance you can see that that p-value is 0.052 so hopefully i can continue with relatively low dunedin pace and we'll see if 2023 data will be statistically reduced relative to 2022. Now as a side note note that 0.77 may allow me to enter the top 10 for the rejuvenation leaderboard and that is a real thing it does exist as shown here the rejuvenation olympics i'll put the link in the video description and what that includes is the average of three dunedin pays tests across six plus months and this is the current top ten based on data not data that doesn't include my current data but i think this was the may update so we can see that my 0.77 would put me in a tie for ninth maybe at worst 10th assuming that the top 10 doesn't change in term in terms of dunedin pace prior to this test i was number 21 and prior to the test before that i was number 20. So it'll be nice to potentially move into the top ten all right so that raises the question then how am i doing it which variables are significantly correlated with dunedin pace so let's start off with foods and the first group of foods being significantly correlated with a slower dunedin pace and that's what we can see here on that list is cinnamon and salt and we can see that the correlation is negative which means that a relatively higher intake of these foods is significantly correlated with a lower or slower than even paste when i say significantly again that's what the p5 less than 0.05 so when considering that these are negative or inverse correlations that suggest that i should eat at the high intake of my range if correlation equals causation that should lead to a slower dunedin pace and using cinnamon as an example we can see that that's true but it was also true for salt on this test now what about food significantly correlated with a faster or don't need a pace that's going in the wrong direction and that's we can see here coconut butter and dates so now we can see that the correlation coefficient is positive so a relatively higher intake of these foods is currently significantly correlated with a faster or an older or going in the wrong direction than eat and pace we can see that the p-value is less than 0.05 and in terms of the intake range and the last test this suggests that i should eat at the low end of my range and while we can see that that's true for coconut butter dates can actually go a little lower now as i mentioned carl these are just correlations and the way i test the way i test it without calculating the false discovery rate is by going following the correlation so if the correlations are positive keeping coconut butter to the low end or or even for dates i i didn't reduce my date intake it's actually a little bit higher so we'll see how that correlation reevaluates after the next round of tests now what i haven't shown yet though is body weight and calorie intake which i'd expect to be significantly correlated with the need and pace especially when considering the calorie restriction study that i just showed but in my case after six tests body weight and calorie intake are not significantly correlated with dunedin pace and that's we can see here although the correlations are currently positive in other words a relatively higher body weight and calorie intake are correlated with an older donated pace or a faster than needed pace we can see that the p-value they are not statistically statistically significant sorry that's hard to say the p-value is greater than 0.05 so after six tests body weight and calorie intake in contrast with the published data so far not significantly correlated with dunedin pace so test number seven is scheduled for uh coming up pretty soon july 2023 so stay tuned for future videos to see how this progresses all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing as mentioned in this video or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
