# Ergothioneine Extends Lifespan In Worms, Flies, And Mice: What About In People?

Ergine is a metabolite that's found in mushrooms that promotes longevity and healthy aging so first let's take a look at the data in mice and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got the probability of survival plotted against age in days and in this study ergine supplementation was started at 7 weeks of age so that's when the mice are young and a dose of 4 to 5 milligrams of erying per kilogram body weight and then in terms of what's significant we put up a red line at 50% surviv that's the time when half of the mice have died and half is still alive and when compared with the control lifespan at that time point we can see that there was a 16% increased median survival for ergine supplemented mice all right what about maximum lifespan so for that we put up a red line at 10% survival so now 90% of the colony has died and only 10% is still alive and here we can see an even greater effect for ooing with a 29% increased maximal survival all right so one anal model or data in one animal model is interesting what about a second so in this study which will be in the video's description if you missed it they also looked at lifespan in celegans in worms and that's what we can see here so when looking at median survival when compared with the lowest dose of ergine 5 millimolar ergine we can see that the lifespan curve shifted in the right direction but that wasn't a significant effect in contrast the higher dose of vergine 10 mill 10 millar erging significantly increased lifespan in sea elegance all right so now we've got two animal models where ergine increases lifespan what about a third well in an earlier video we saw that ergathon increases lifespan in flies and if you missed it it'll be in the right corner so we've got three animal models ergine extended lifespan in each of them while that's interesting what i care about and what most of the people watching the channel care about is could ergine impact health in people and interestingly in this study that we're about to see higher plasma levels of arginine were associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes so in this study it included people with an average age of 58 years with a 22-year follow-up in other words starting with the baseline assessment of plasma metabolite levels what was the risk of death based on those levels an average of 22 years later and then to address that we put up a red line at the log hazard ratio of zero and then to the right of that line relatively higher plasma levels of metabolites are would be associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and just to highlight what was the case for that it was cotinine or coton i don't know how you say it but that's a marker of smoking or tobacco use so in other words relatively higher levels of kine were associated with a maximally increased all cause mortality risk relative to all the other metabolites that are to the right of that log ha the ratio of zero but that shouldn't be a surprise smoking is bad for us the plasma metabolite levels just uh support that data all right now to the left of a hazard ratio log hazard ratio of zero relatively higher plasma levels of metabolites would be associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk and we can see that the metabolite that's farthest to the left in this case is ergine in other words relatively higher plasma levels of ergine are associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk now before we all go out and start eating a ton more mushrooms note that while ergine can be increased by diet it can also be degraded by gut bacteria so measuring plasma levels is essential and we'll soon be able to track plasma levels of ergine and that's using iolo's atome metabol metabolomics kit now after some gentle proding for me and trying to get them to add this into their product i've been told that it will be added for may of 2024 so expect an update video you know as in ergo extends lifespan what's my data coming probably sometime in early june all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buck aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for atome metabolomics epigenetic testing or microbiome composition any quantification at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob and now grim age green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
