# Attempting To Slow The Epigenetic Pace Of Aging (13-Test Analysis)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Who has the slowest epigenetic pace of aging that's what the rejuvenation olympics aims to find out with the top 15 for its leaderboard shown here now the rejuvenation olympics is based on the donan pace test which then raises the question how good is donan pace donan pace is as good as the best epigenetic locks for its association with all cause mortality risk and that's what we'll see here on the y- axis we've got the mortality effect size hr which is the hazard ratio in other words risk of death for all causes or all cause mortality risk and then on the x-axis we've got six gold standard epigenetic clocks danan pace an earlier iteration of danan pace danan pace of aging methylation p m horvath hanam phenoage and note that this isn't the pheno ag test that includes albumin alkaline phosphotase white blood cells this is the epigenetic test that corresponds to phenoh different test and then also grim age and these six epigenetic clocks were evaluated for against all cause mortality risk in two different studies the normative aging study and framingham offspring so in terms of what was significant we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one and remember where the vertical line above and below each of the circles is completely above that red line we have a significant association so that's true for don and pace in both studies and the earlier iteration of denan pace also both was associated was was also associated with an increase all cause mortality risk in both studies in contrast well actually not in contrast before i get to the horvath and hanom data we can also see that that's true for pheno age and grim age in all in other words an older pheno age and an older grim age were significantly associated with an increased all cause mortality risk and for d den and pace a faster epigenetic pace of aging was associated with an increased al cause mortality risk now for the epigenetic clocks that were not associated with an increased all cause mortality risk for the normative aging study that was horvath and hanm we can see that the vertical lines above and below the circles completely overlap with one in the normative aging study so not not significant and note that horvath is the best clock epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age but as we can see here it's not amongst the best for its association with all cause mortality risk and then in framingham offspring you can see that horvath is once again not associated with all cause mortality risk whereas hanam is as both the vertical lines above and below that circle are above the hazard ratio of one so from this from these data we can see that donan pace is as good as the best epigenetic clocks for its association with all cause mortality risk but where this test really shines is that it's the only clock to identify a slower epigenetic pace of aging for people that were calorie restricted by 12% in a 2-year study and that's what we'll see here in these five images on the y- axis we've got the epigenetic change from baseline for the horvath hanam phenoage grimage and donm pace epigenetic clocks and then there were two dietary groups ad lib and then again this is a human study so people that were uh ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted that's ad lib al and then the calorie restricted group which ate 12% fewer calories over the course of the 2 years study and then we've got three time points where epigenetic age was assessed or the epigenetic pace of aging was assessed baseline 12 and 24 months on the adlib or cr diet so first for both horvath and hanam at both time points there was no significant difference for epigenetic age for the adli vers cr group and then similarly for pheno age and grim age three of the four uh time points were not significantly different and then you may notice that that red triangle looked different for pheno ag but that's not it wasn't significantly different from the uh blue circles in other words and actually that data looks like it's going in the wrong direction where people who were on cr for two years would have an older that would be the trend for an older uh epigenetic age as measured by pheno wage nonetheless it wasn't significant so we can't conclude anything about epigenetic age using pheno wage comparing people on cr versus ad lib in contrast when looking at d d and pace people on the ad lib diet had an increased epigenetic pace of aging over those two time points whereas people on cr 12% cr for that 2-year period had a reduced epigenetic pace of aging and those differences were significant so from these data we can see that d danan pace is the only clock to identify a slower epigenetic pace of aging for people that were on a 12% calor restricted diet for 2 years all right so one of the main focuses of this channel is to optimize biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible and epigenetics at the molecular level that's one of the tiers which i'm uh trying to improve it's not just cells proteins uh and other markers so with that in mind what's my data so to address that i send blood to true diagnostic and if you want to measure your own your own epigenetic age including d and pace discount link in the video's description so for the most recent test this is for a march tw uh 4th 2024 this is test number two in 2024 results just came in about last week so here we are with the video so for that test in march don needan pace was 0.82 so what does that mean so the slowest epigenetic aging rate using this test is 0.6 as shown in green whereas the fastest epigenetic aging rate is 1.4 so 82 is on the right side of that odometer now we can put this into context a different way too by looking at how d and pace changes during aging and that's what shown here with d and pace values on the y-axis plotted against chronological age and then my data is that orange dot and we can see that it's slower than average average it's slower than the average denan pace based on my chronological age so the blue line would be the trend line for how the denan pace changes during aging and we can see that the orange dot is below that now that blue line is also significant because it indicates that donan pace increases during aging in other words it's harder to maintain a relatively younger denan pace somewhere around as chronological age advances so with with that in mind my goal isn't just to get from 0.8 to 0.6 it's to keep it as youthful as possible for as long as possible now as i mentioned in many videos this is just one test it's important to not get too excited or too down for just one te test what matters are year-to-year changes so with that in mind from more context let's have a look at all tests since 2022 and that's what we can see here i have 13 tests from 20 22 to 2024 on the waxes we've got done e and pace values and then for three tests in 2022 average stud in pace was 0.84 over eight tests in 2023 average was 0.80 so good news knowing that d pace increases during aging but it's important to note that three tests in 2022 may not be representative of a full year a full year's worth of data whereas eight tests in 2023 probably closer to the truth in terms of what my full year average uh was around all right so when considering 2023 data what about 2024 so after those first two tests my average d pace is 0.81 around in the same ballpark of where it was in 2023 so far obviously the goal is to improve it so remember that to get on to the rejuvenation olympics leader board they want the most recent three test average within the past 6 months so with that my average is 785 so where would that rank on the leaderboard and it would put me into a tie for 11th they haven't updated the list in a while but it would put me into a tie for 11th place but the rules to get on the leaderboard are a little bit screwy you can see it says the mean or average of the need and pace across six plus months so i don't just have three tests in the past six months i have five tests and my average over those five tests in the past six months is8 787 which would put me into 12th place so no matter how you cut it i should be on the leaderboard when a new update uh comes in whenever they post that update all right but the goal isn't just to stay around 0.7 79 or so it's to move up and not for the ego trip of saying i i'm i have the lowest epigenetic pace of aging i i couldn't care less about that what i care about is getting to my slowest epigenetic pace of aging and keeping it keeping it there indefinitely so with that in mind how can i reduce stud need and pace so first let's take a look at correlations for diet with d and past and for those who are new to the channel or unfamiliar since 2015 i i've weighed all my food and those daily amounts go into a food tracking app known as chronometer and then i manually enter that data into a spreadsheet and with that in mind each blood test then has a corresponding average dietary intake in other words if there are 50 days in between blood tests the average dietary intake for those 50 days then l l up with the latter test so now every blood test not just for dun and paast any biomarker that i'm measuring on that day has an average dietary intake and then i can c calculate correlations because i have up to 50 blood tests for many things and 13 for denita pace i can c calculate correlations for diet including macro micronutrients and individual foods with biomarkers and then with the goal of improving biomarkers i follow as many of the significant with a p value less than 0.05 i follow as many of those significant correlations as possible and then after each test i recalculate the correlations and then continue to follow the top correlations with the goal of improving biomarkers it's a constant iterative process of following correlations testing seeing what the data shows with the goal of improvement so for following this most recent test the 13 test for den need and pace let's take a look at comparisons for foods macro and micronutrients and i looked at 91 comparisons on that list foods macros and micros with the top of the list shown here full correlations for all biomarkers on the correlations tier on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out so for this table we've got the food or nutrient on the left the correlation in the middle and then the p value with less than 0.05 being significant and what we can see is that none of these uh foods or nutrients that are on the list have the p value less than 0.05 so unfortunately once again following test number 13 i have no room you know no no leads in terms of diet for optimizing or improving don and pace so just like i did for the last video in this series because i'm testing other biomarkers on the same day as donan past i get full chemistry panel cbc and all of that good stuff metabolomics so i can look at correlations for other biomarkers with d and past to gain more insight and if you saw the last video in this series donita pace was significantly associated with ldl in fact in inverse correlation as you can see there with the correlation coefficient of minus 0.61 what that suggests is that within my range for ldl and don need and pace higher ldl is correlated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging and conversely when my ldl was lower that was significantly correlated with a faster epigenetic pace of aging now note that my ldl range is 62 to 83 in this case so i i don't know if this extrapolates to people with far higher l ldls i don't know if there's a u-shape to this or even if this is a real correlation time will tell with more testing so this was for 11 tests now for test number 12 and remember one of the tests is missing i mentioned i have 13 tests now i'm saying i have 12 tests because i have 12 tests for den and pace on the same day as biomarkers where i have 13 total tests for don and pace so i can only look at uh co code correlations for ldl and other bi markers with the need and pace so prior to the test after this for the march 4th test the goal was to increase ldl by increasing saturated fatty acid intake with coconut butter and why saturated fatty acids and why coconut butter as i mentioned in the previous video in this series that's one of the most uh that's one of the strongest correlations for higher ldl in my data and again those correlations are on the correlations tier on patreon so then the obvious question is did i actually increase saturated fatty acid intake or uh actually coconut butter as a means for increasing ldl because if i'm just going to wing it and say yeah i kind of ate more i think i ate more maybe i didn't so by tracking i can actually answer that question so for 3 weeks prior to the march test and the test before that january 15th coconut butter intake for that 21-day period was 26 days for the most recent test or it was only 16 gram per day for that january test so in other words i increased coconut butter and i used the two sample t test to confirm that or to evaluate that you can see that its p value is less than 0.05 in other words i significantly increased coconut butter intake prior to the march test relative to the january test so then that raises the question did ldl increase so we can see the now we can see the 12 test correlation this is the most recent data after the march 4th test and to address the question did ldl increase we can see that it was 82 uh milligrams per deciliter so towards the high end of my range but the goal was to get it even higher it was to get me outside of my normal range within this uh 12 test range i wanted to push it to 8590 or even a little bit higher to really evaluate this correlation for ldl with don and pace so to answer the question did ldl increase it didn't so then that raised the question should i even be pursuing this uh hypothesis and to address that question is is the ldl d and pace correlation still significant because if it isn't i'm going to have to try to come up with a way to try to optimize done e and pace so as we can see with the p value and the correlation coefficient still being negative .57 it's right at that border of statistical significance still 0.05 so the answer is yes this correlation is still significant i'm still going to continue to pursue a higher ldl to see if i can reduce the needen pace to see if correlation may indeed equal causation i don't presume that it is but we've got to do the experiment to find out so for test number 13 with actually it's test number 14 but test number 13 where i'll have biomarkers with the kn and pace for the next test the goal is to increase not just saturated fatty acid intake with coconut butter but also adding uh more cholesterol into my diet in this case from eggs because in looking at the correlations for ldl with my diet higher ldl via diet it's not just saturated fatty acids that are at the top of my list cholesterol is right under there too so the combination of saturated fatty acids from coconut butter and adding more ch ol into my diet may push ldl a bit higher so i've added eggs back in five eggs per week for now and sure i could go much higher for that but remember i'm not trying to blow up the system trying to make very small changes with the goal of improving d don and pace without messing anything else up and then if i'm able to push ldl out to 8590 and maybe even a little bit higher will i see consistently see the need and paces in the low 0.7 range 73 or somewhere there around there there to find out the next test is scheduled for april 29th of 2024 so stay tuned for that data coming probably sometime in early june all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buyck aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing or microbiome composition n quantification at home metabolomics at home blood testing with sciox health which includes apob b and now grimage green tea die tracking with chronometer which i mentioned earlier or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
