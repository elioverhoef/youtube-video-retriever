## Transcript

During aging the day novo any desynthesis pathway is dysfunctional and that's what we'll see here so first we know that any d levels decline during aging and so to trip the fan levels so that at least suggests there's an attempted increased flux through the day novel nad synthesis pathway in support of that chinine levels increase during aging so more tryptophan is converted into chin uranine similarly quinolinic acid levels increase during aging and that quinolinic acid levels increase but nad levels decrease during aging that suggests that there's an age-related block potentially in the conversion of quinolinic acid into nad so let's take a deeper look at that pathway and that's what we can see here so quinolinic acid is converted by qa quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase qaprt into namn and then after two more enzymatic steps is converted into nad now there's probably a dysfunctional qa prt it's probably dysfunction during aging and i'll explain more in and explain why in a second now fortunately there are backup pathways for increasing nad first the price handler pathway which nicotinic acid n a is converted also into nan and then those same two enzymatic steps uh nicotinic acid would then be converted into nad now personally i've had a big bump in nad levels more than doubling using nicotinic acid but i've yet to have success through the day novo and a desynthesis pathway which further implicates qa prt as potentially being dysfunctional at least in my case now in addition to the price handler pathway there's also the salvage pathway including nam niacinamide nmn and nr which are also converted into nad however taking these precursors nicotinic acid nicotinamide and am nmn or nr doesn't address the age-related problem with the de novo nad synthesis pathway so with that in mind can we increase qaprt activity thereby increasing nad and this will be my second attempt at that or my second hypothesis in that realm the first being grape seed proanthocyanidines which failed so let's see what the most recent hypothesis is and that involves clofibrate which increases qprt activity qprt being quinolinate fossil ribosil transferase the same as qaprt now for a quick intro onto clofibrate it's a lipid lowering drug so the importance of clofibrate is that we can see that it increases qprt at qprt activity and this is a study done in rats that were fed 0.25 clofibrate in their diet for two weeks controls who were not fed this clofibrate in white and then the clofibrate treated rats are in the shaded grape gray bar and there we can see there's an approximate doubling of qprt activity this is in liver in rats that are fed clofibrate now more importantly liver levels of nad increase in rats that were fed clofibrate and that's we can see here with that approximate doubling of liver levels of nad so with that in mind should i use clofibrate to try to increase nad so i have a different plan and one reason for that is because my approach tries to focus almost exclusively on whole foods i try to stay away from prescribed medications and supplements as much as physically possible so with that mind clofibrate is a known activator of p par alpha which is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha now can other p par alpha activators be used to increase nad and potentially maybe even more safely as it's maybe there aren't there are ways to increase it without having to use a prescribed medication if so which ones so to address that let's take a deeper look at p par alpha's location and function in the cell so it's right there p par alpha and the center of the nucleus and then people are alpha activation induces gene expression and for a short list we can see that here highlighted by that box and just to highlight one of them we can see that p part alpha activation increases levels of fgf21 now the importance of that gene or protein is that fgf21 overexpression increases lifespan at least in mice and if you missed that video it'll be right there in the right corner now note that people are alpha also activates qprt which isn't on this list so in terms of p part alpha activators they include fibrates which clofibrate is in that class but also a compound known as wy14643 and we can see that here as these are ligands or activators of p par alpha and just to highlight their ability to impact p part alpha activation that's what we'll see here so on the bottom on the y-axis we've got three different compounds wy14643 and then two different fibrates ciprofibrate and clofibrate now note that clofibrate is indeed a p power activator as shown here with a 16-fold activation in the presence of clofibrate so once again we can see that p par alpha activation especially biclofibrate may be a mechanism for impacting nad now even better is ciprofibrate which has about a 21-fold increased activity or increased activation of p par alpha but the best of this punch is wy 14643 we can see a 26-fold induction of p par alpha activation but there are also other things that can activate p power alpha and we can go away from these prescribed medications including polyunsaturated fatty acids or proof of which activate p per alpha and we can see that there as pufas are ligands and activators of again p par alpha and we can get them from the diet so can including more pufas in the diet increase p par alpha activity thereby resulting in higher nad if so which polyunsaturated fatty acids so to address that we'll see this data here first on the left on the y-axis starting with p part alpha activation and then we've got the gold standard wy 14643 again in this study it was 25-fold induced in so wy 14643 induced p part alpha activity 25-fold all right so what about the polyunsaturated fatty acids so we can see that there's a group of four that had pretty decent p par alpha activation with the best of the bunch being alpha linolenic acid with about a 15-fold induction of p par alpha activation and note that this is an in vitro study this is done in cells whether these data would be true in people is yet to be determined but i'm i'm going to do that experiment and we'll find out now alpha linolenic acid then raises the question if i eat more of it can that increase nad and alpha linoleic acid or ala foods that are rich in that fatty acid are flax seeds and chia so i already have flax seeds in my diet it's a relatively easy jump to include more to further increase alpha linole alpha linolenic acid intake as a means to potentially increase nad but that's not the only poofa that can increase p par alpha activation you can see that there are three others that aren't as good but still relatively good in the 10 to 12 fold p part alpha activation range including linoleic gamma linolenic and arachidonic interestingly in contrast note that there was no or weak p par alpha activation for saturated fatty acids or sfas including medium and uh or relatively short and medium chain saturated fatty acids going from c8 to c14 for the carbon chain length now i get the majority of those fatty acids in my diet from daily coconut butter so it's a relatively easy switch to reduce that by a little bit and increase ala but also note that c16 or stearic acid didn't really much have an impact on p par alpha activation either and i get a pretty decent amount of that from cocoa beans so for me i'm going to cut those down by a little bit not eliminate and then further increase ala to test this hypothesis but these aren't the only polyunsaturated fatty acids that activate p par alpha fish oil fatty acids including epa and dha also activate p par alpha and that's what we'll see here and once again this also is an in vitro study that was done in cell so one whether this data would be true in people there's no way to know without testing so again that's what i'm that's what i'm aiming to do is to directly test this by measuring nad and first increasing these pufa levels in my diet so at the top we've got percent p par alpha activation and then when these cells were not induced just basal levels of p par alpha activity it was 21 activated but then for each 50 micromolar increase of each of the compounds that i'm going to show p part alpha the percentage of p part alpha activation was evaluated and first that gold standard for activating p per alpha wy14643 we can see that there was a nearly five-fold increase in p par alpha activation 99 people are alpha activation but what about the polyunsaturated fatty acids so first starting with the same or some of the three that were in the image on the left linoleenic acid linoleic and arachidonic we can see that these are pretty good in a head-to-head matchup with the gold standard for inducing people alpha activity wy 14643 as those three pufas also activated it to a hundred percent or more in other words a five-fold activation over non-induced cells that didn't have p bar alpha activators but then what about the fish oil fatty acids epa and dha so first epa may not be the best of the bunch because we can see that it's people alpha activation was 92 percent but still that's about a four and a half fold increase over basal levels so still a pretty good increase in people alpha activity but the best of the bunch is dha and we can see that that's about a seven-fold increase above non-induced cells that didn't have people alpha activators and even better than that gold standard for activating p per alpha wy14643 now to further illustrate the importance of these polyunsaturated fatty acids as a potential means for activating p per alpha and increasing nad levels their levels circulating levels decline during aging and that's what we can see here so we've got four of those fatty acids dha epa linoleenate which could be the alpha or gamma and arachidane and then they're circulating levels in 67 year olds and 97 year olds and then whether there were significant differences between the groups p-value and the false discovery rate fdr so we can see for each of these four polyunsaturated fatty acids they were higher in the younger group when compared with the older group and significantly higher as the p-value and fdr are both below 0.05 so that then raises the question and hypothesis if i eat more fish and more fish oil in addition to alpha linoleenic acid can i further activate p par alpha and increase nad and to test that i'm going to send an nad sample or a blood sample to ginfinity who does the nad analysis sometime in september of 2023 so sorry so stay tuned for that data in a future video all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics any dequantification epigenetic and telomere testing or a microbiome composition green tea at home blood testing with cyphox health note that their panel is almost exclusively different from io lowe's kit including apo b diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee all these links will be in the video's description we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the
