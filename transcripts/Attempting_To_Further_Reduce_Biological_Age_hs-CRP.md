# Attempting To Further Reduce Biological Age: hs-CRP

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Earlier this month i blood tested for the fourth time in 2021 and using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as an index of biological age we can see that my biological age is 35.7 which is about 13 years younger than my chronological age but there is room for improvement and one way to improve may be by reducing levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein or crp for sure so that'll be the focus of today's video attempting to further reduce biological age by reducing levels of high sensitivity c reactive protein so first how does my recent value for crp compare with the general population and that's what's shown here this is a study of about 6 000 people and if anybody's come across larger studies that looked at age-related changes for crp please post it in the comments and i'll likely include it in the next crp video so we're looking at median values of crp for the various age groups starting from 18 to 30 years old on the left all the way up past seven year olds on the right and for my age group i'm doing i guess pretty well uh compared to the median value for my age group which is somewhere around one so i'm about half that for now but i think i can do even better not just compared with the general population but within my own data so how does this recent value for crp compare with my compared with my previous data now i've only been tracking crp for the past three years and i have 16 blood tests over that uh time period i wish i'd been tracking it in conjunction with diet for longer than that but that's what i've got so i'm looking at 16 blood tests for crp over the past three years we can see that my average is about the same as what my recent value was so 0.53 for the average whereas 0.57 for the data about three weeks ago so why do i think i can do better than if it's pretty close to my average value well i've had crp values as low as 0.2 milligrams per liter so that gives me hope that i can get back to that but i just need to identify what consistently impacts crp so that i can consistently stay at that relatively low level of inflammation conversely i've also had crp levels in the past three plus years as high as about one so when considering that range is is somewhat wide for crp it's important to identify the dietary factors that may impact it so i can get it consistently closer to lower than where it is now and that's important because levels of high sensitivity c reactive protein increase during aging and though although i haven't included it in this video hot relatively high levels are also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so by identifying the variables that can impact high sensitivity c reactive protein not only can i potentially slow the age-related increase but also potentially reduce all-cause mortality risk so first in terms of diet i decided to look at dietary macronutrients since that's the major composition relative to vitamins and minerals in terms of things that could potentially be correlated significantly correlated with high sensitivity c-reactive protein so that's what we're looking at here in terms of macronutrients we're looking at calories total carbohydrate intake total fructose intake and we'll see why that's important in a minute fiber intake total fat intake monounsaturated fatty acid intake mufa omega-3 omega-6 saturated fat intake and protein now for those who are new to the channel i've been tracking my diet since 2015 weighing all my food and then logging all of that data and entering all of that data into an excel file when i say logging all that data using online tool and then logging all that data into an excel file and then looking at correlations between my diet with with each corresponding blood test so when looking at the macronutrients none of them are significantly correlated with c-reactive protein so for more insight i then investigated correlations for crp with big picture quote-unquote big picture biomarkers biomarkers of uh organ and systemic health and that's what's shown here so you know we've got glucose which should be obvious for anyone interested in a pro-longevity strategy we've got markers of kidney function liver function all of the various lipoproteins uh immune cells red blood red blood cell rbc related uh um so red blood cells mcv and the rdw so mean corpuscular volume mcb and the red blood cell distribution disrepute sorry distribution with rdw and then the overall biological age score so how do how do how does high sensitivity react to protein correlate with these big picture biomarkers so it's not significantly correlated with glucose or kidney function or any of the liver function markers but now we can see something interesting going on with lipoproteins and more specifically hot relatively high levels of total cholesterol and again this is over 16 blood tests you can see the little end that's how many blood tests that i have data for the correlation with crp with each biomarker so relatively higher levels of total cholesterol in my data is correlated with lower levels of high sensitivity c reactive protein and one factor that may be driving that correlation is hdl as we can see that's also significantly correlated with lower levels of crp so ldl is relatively close to statistical significance um and going in the same direction so relatively high levels of ldl lower levels of crp but that's not statistically significant yet it's close to it and if it becomes statistically significant i'll include it in future videos so just going further c-react protein versus immune cells surprisingly not significantly correlated it wasn't also significantly correlated with any of the red blood cell related measures not surprisingly it's significantly correlated with an older phenoage and that's not surprising because c-reactive protein is a component of phenoage so higher crp higher phenoage not a surprise and then it's not significantly correlated with the aging.ai biological age so let's take a closer look at the significant correlation for high sensitivity c reactive protein with hdl and that's what's shown here so 16 blood tests for crp versus hdl from june of 2018 through nine or the september 2021 blood test and first note that whereas my crp range was also very wide my range for hdl is also somewhat somewhat wide so uh my hdl ranges from as low as 34 milligrams per deciliter all the way up to 56 and note that the sweet spot for having relatively lower levels of crp so below 0.5 or around my average seem to be at around higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter for hdl so if i can more consistently increase hdl to greater than 50 one would expect if correlation can in you know actually impose causation we would expect that crp should also be consistently reduced below a 0.53 and with that in mind what can impact it's more specifically which dietary factors can impact hdl so for that i go straight to uh back to the correlations dietary macronutrients correlations for that with hdl and in first starting with what's not significant so total calories total fiber intake uh monounsaturated fatty acids omega-3 omega-6 and total protein intake are not significantly correlated with hdl and note that i've been studying hdl or tracking it for a much longer time than crp so i have 32 blood tests and i have dietary data for all of that period starting from august of 2015 through september 2021 so what is significantly correlated with hdl here and again we can see now that uh total carbohydrate intake and total fructose intake higher levels for that are correlated with lower levels of hdl significantly correlated and also closely significantly correlated are total fat intake and more specifically saturated fat intake but because they aren't statistically significant yet i won't focus the rest of this video on fat and saturated fat that if they become statistically significant i may include them in a future video now note that uh this may be uh this to me suggests an indirect effect of carbohydrate and total fructose on hdl and then hdl potentially impacting crp and the reason i think that is because total carbohydrate and total fructose intake was not significantly correlated with uh c-reactive protein although it was relatively close with a p-value of of about 0.09 similarly higher total and saturated fat were somewhat close to being significantly correlated with crp having p-values less than 0.15 so to me that suggests an indirect effect whereas diet can impact hdl and hdl can impact c-reactive protein rather than diet impacting c-reactive protein directly at least in my data now also last but not least uh there is some data that dietary cholesterol can impact lipoproteins including hdl so i looked at that correlation and as we can see there isn't a significant correlation between how much dietary cholesterol that i eat with my circulating levels of hdl so let's take a closer look at the correlation for total fructose with my hdl and that's what's shown here so again i have a lot more data for hdl since i've been tracking that since 2015 whereas crp have only been tracking it since 2018. So this is data for 32 blood tests and again i've been tracking my diet since 2015 so i can correlate uh stuff in my diet with biomarkers and that's what we're doing here for hdl versus fructose so again notice the the variability for crp and i've also got variability for hdl and one reason for that may be the variability in my fructose intake which there is a relatively wide range 71 grams per day to up to 128 grams per day for my average daily fructose intake and again note that a higher average daily fructose intake is correlated with lower hdl which is going in the wrong direction but if we extrapolate to the left we can see that if i'm aiming for higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter for hdl i would need to have an average daily fructose intake of less than about 70 grams per day and even better getting closer towards 60 grams per day so if i limit it fructose intake will it increase hdl and potentially reduce c-reactive protein but mess up other biomarkers and for that we go back to the big picture biomarkers and for this i've included homocysteine because i'm also paying attention to that and if anyone is familiar with the channel they've seen my homosystem videos so how does how is fructose correlated with these big picture around 20 biomarkers so first notice that a higher intake of fructose again in my data is correlated with lower levels of glucose and that's somewhat surprising but the majority of my fructose intake is not coming from actually exclusively the my fructose intake is exclusively coming from fruits and vegetables it's not coming from sugary drinks or processed foods so uh this could just be a marker of berry intake higher levels of berries being correlated with lower glucose now conversely though a higher fructose intake is correlated with higher levels of uric acid and that's important because as shown here this is the hazard ratio for all cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against uric acid concentration uh on the x-axis and this is a study of more than 425 000 people and what we can see is that relatively higher levels of uric acid are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so this correlation for fructose with uric acid is going in the wrong direction also going in the wrong direction are red blood cells so higher and higher average daily fructose intake being correlated with lower levels of red blood cells which decline during aging so we don't want lower levels of them of them they're going in the wrong direction based on that correlation and also going in the wrong direction is the red blood cell distribution with rdw so higher fructose intake is correlated with a higher rdw which is also going in the wrong direction because rdw increases during aging and relatively higher levels for rdw are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and again i have videos for that uh if you're interested just just do a search on my channel and it'll come up now what fructose isn't significantly correlated with is all of the ns is not significant so homocysteine creatinine is a marker of kidney function none of the liver function markers none of the remaining lipoproteins total cholesterol ldl vldl and lipoprotein a none of the immune cells or immune related cells mcv it's not significantly correlated it's not significantly correlated with high sensitivity c-reactive protein which again goes back to that hypothesis of fructose impacting hdl hdl then potentially impacting crp and fructose my fructose intake is not significantly correlated with the overall biological age score as indicated by levine's phenoage or aging.ai so with this in mind the net correlative effect of dietary fructose my dietary fructose intake and may be different for everybody else on these big big big picture biomarkers is one going in the right direction glucose but four going in the wrong direction including hdl uric acid red blood cells and the rdw so the net effect for uh fructose would be a net of negative three so that suggests that if i limit my fructose intake not only may i see improvements for hdl and potentially reduce crp but improve other biomarkers too so uh with that in mind since the last blood test early in september it's been 24 days and my average daily fructose intake since that test is about 69 grams per day which isn't 60 grams yet but that would if if i blood tested today that would be the lowest amount average amount of fructose that i've eaten in this six year six year span so uh you know progress as a means towards uh getting closer to perfection so for for the next blood test then when considering that i'm on the road for reducing my fructose intake uh will hdl be increa increased and high sensitivity uh crp be decreased all right that's all for now if you're interested in more info about my biohacking approach uh my attempts to biohack aging come join us on patreon and uh thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the video have a great day
