The main ways that we're told to slow the spread of the corona virus infection are to wear a mask wash our hands and socially distance but what about diet it's almost never talked about so today i'm going to talk about a paper that proposed the idea that is hesse pride in a metabolite that's found in peppermint leaves lemon orange including navels and blood oranges is it is that metabolite essential for prophylaxis in other words prevention and treatment of the cova 19 infection so let's have a look at what they proposed so there are three main ways that they propose that hesse bryden may prevent and/or treat the corona virus infection so first when looking at the corona virus itself and its structure current virus spike proteins bind to the ace 2 receptor allowing it to enter cells where it then tricks ourselves to make more of itself leading to immune activation and an excessive pro-inflammatory response now in a virtual screening study it was shown that hesperidin was a very strong inhibitor of this process so essentially preventing the the tsarskoe v 2 virus to enter cells so that would be the first way that it could prevent an or treat corona virus infection now in the second way this is an in vitro study meaning it was done in cells where hesperidin has been shown to up regulate the interferon map kinase pathway which is involved in increasing cell immunity against infection in this case the infection was influenza a virus now studies looking at the ability of hesperidin to up regulate this pathway to improve our immune systems response to the tsarskoe b2 virus have not yet been performed but there is data in in the cova 19 disease that the map kinase pathway is an important pathway for it in people who have survived by the infection so and then third the cytokine storm in other words an immune overreaction to the infection is is widely known and included amongst those pro-inflammatory molecules are interleukin-1 beta and interleukin is two and six interferon gamma and tnf alpha now has bryden in a variety of studies that were not looking at the ability of hesperidin to inhibit these pro-inflammatory molecules in the cova 19 situation but in other studies has bryden has been shown to inhibit each of these inflammatory metabolites which would suggest that it would also work in the cova 19 situation now i should say no randomized control trials no rcts have yet looked at the ability to pass pride and to actually do these things in the cova 19 situation but based on the data that they present in the paper for each of these pathways it may be a good option so where can we get hesse pride and from so as i mentioned it's found in in relatively high concentrations and lemons oranges and peppermint so to look up that data i went to phenol explored you and if you want to look up that day to yourself i took a screenshot so you can see the data and just looking at the pure juice not necessarily from concentrate that i'd want to go with whole foods and not supplements or not you know the concentrate from the food i'd want to eat the whole food to get it from the whole food so when looking at it like that we can see that lemon juice navel oranges otherwise known as blonde oranges and blood oranges have pretty decent amounts of hesse bridon now the highest amounts of hesperidin on this list are found in dried peppermint this is a bit misleading because nobody's gonna go and eat a hundred grams of dried peppermint which is what this value for 181 milligrams per hundred grams of dried peppermint peppermint leaves but one gram of dried peppermint translates into about four grams of fresh peppermint so - you can then divide this 481 by four so you get about a hundred and twenty milligrams of hesperidin per 100 grams of fresh peppermint leaves and i've actually been taking about 70 grams of peppermint putting it in smoothies and blending it with other stuff to try to get more has brought in into my diet so that's all i've got there are lots of ways to find me online all them listed here have a good day
