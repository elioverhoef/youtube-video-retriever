# Quantifying Biological Age: Blood Test #2 in 2021

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

With the goal of evaluating my biological age on wednesday i blood tested for the second time in 2021 so based on that data and using levine's phenotypic age which is also known as biological age calculator we can see that my biological age is 36 which is 12.2 years younger than my chronological age of 48. So which biomarkers are youthful so i've highlighted that albumin the percentage of lymphocytes the average red blood cell volume red blood cell distribution width alkaline phosphatase and white blood cells are all found or are all youthful or are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk and if you're interested in that data i explained it in the video that i you can link to in the right corner alternatively which biomarkers can be improved so i've had lower levels of creatinine and glucose which is going in the right direction and also note that my high sensitivity c reactive protein is 1.01 milligrams per liter so for crp lower is better i just made a video on that last week and on my last blood test it was 0.27 milligrams per liter so this is up almost four-fold so more on that in a minute now levine's test includes age chronological age so the maximal biological age reduction is only about 20 years uh so in contrast aging.ai does not include include age so larger biological age ba reductions are possible so with that in mind what's my age biological age with aging.ai so this is aging.ai 3.0 and that version includes 19 biomarkers that are found on the standard chem panel and complete blood count cbc and if anyone's interested in double checking my numbers you can just plug in these data and verify so based on the data that i presented there my biological age with aging.ai is 27 years so 21 years younger than my chronological age now beyond these tools being biological age metrics having a younger biological age both by levine's test and aging.ai is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk so i'll link to that on the last slide if you're interested in that data now for this blood test going back to c-reactive protein i tried to reduce crp by increasing my hdl and i tried a variety of interventions uh and i that's in my quantifying biological age video number one again you can check that out if you're interested so uh my hdl was 49 previously and because of a correlation with hdl uh with c reactor protein i expected a higher hdl and correspondingly uh lower uh high sensitivity reactive protein but as we can see by the right hour my hdl actually went down a little bit while a c c reactive protein went up again almost four fold so that clearly didn't work so what's going to be the plan for improving uh crp going forward into my next blood test so first are there correlations between my diet with crp so in the first step i investigate macronutrient correlations with crp so this means looking at correlations for total calorie intake total fat uh but then also individual amounts of fat including monounsaturated fats uh omega-3 and omega-6 fat intake as measures of polyunsaturated fats my saturated fat intake fiber intake and protein intake and look for correlations between that with a given biomarker in this case being c-reactive protein now in step two i then investigate correlations for individual foods and micronutrients with crp and or other variables now i'm not going to go through that data in this video because i just got you know the blood test data on thursday so that that actually takes a a significant amount of time that i didn't have over the past three days but uh i that i may put that in in an upcoming video so of the macronutrients that i mentioned the only macronutrient that was significantly correlated with c-reactor protein high sensitivity c-reactive protein was my mufa monounsaturated fatty acid intake and that's what we can see here with a high sensitivity c-reactor protein plotted on the y-axis against my average daily mufa intake in grams per day on the x-axis and what we can see is that a higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids is correlated significantly correlated with a correlation correlation coefficient of negative 0.61 with lower high sensitivity c-reactive protein and this correlation is statistically significant as you can see by the p-value now if i improve c-reactive protein and assuming correlation can impact causation assuming that um will i make one thing better c-reactive protein but make other biomarkers worse thereby negatively impacting my overall biological age score so will increasing move intake negatively affect the other eight biomarkers on levene's test so to assess that we can see we can evaluate the correlation so first you can see the correlation uh with monounsaturated fatty acids with high sensitive c-reactive protein that correlation again being significant and then the correlation for mufa might the average daily move intake with the eight other eight biomarkers on levine's test and what we can see is that for the other eight biomarkers the correlation with monoliths the average daily monounsaturated fatty fatty acid intake there are weak correlations with correlation coefficients of less than 0.3 or greater than negative 0.3 so to answer the question will increasing monounsaturated fatty acid intake negatively negatively affect the other eight biomarkers on the beans test based on this data maybe not so with that in mind my goal for the next blood test is to aim for a monounsaturated fatty acid intake of about 20 grams per day which is the uh the far end of of the linear line and if this is a true uh if this is a correlation that can impact causation we'd expect that by uh increasing my mufa intake based on the plot that i should see correspondingly a reduction in high sensitivity c-reactive protein and two of my main sources that i prefer to get my monounsaturated fats from are almonds and cashews so i'm going to increase my intake of those nuts all right that's all i've got for now uh thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day
