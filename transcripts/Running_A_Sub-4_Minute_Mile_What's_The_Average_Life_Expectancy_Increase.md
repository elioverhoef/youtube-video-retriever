## Transcript

What's the average life expectancy increase for those who have run a 4minute mile to address that let's take a look at this recently published study that looked at longevity of the first 200 people to run a sub 4minute mile but first note that these data are exclusively in men what about the data for women runners to date the fastest mile run by a woman is about 4 minutes and 8 seconds so unfortunately we'll have to wait for that story in a future video but jumping into the data for a men on the y- axis we've got the proportion surviving on the y- axis plotted against years since achieving the sub4 minute mile on the x with up to 70 years after the running the initial sub 4minute mile and then there are two groups the runners in red and the match general population in blue in terms of survival we put up a black line at 0.5 survival this is a time when half the population has died and half is still alive and then when looking at the shaded red region for the runners we can see that that's shifted to the right when compared with the match general population in other words there's there's a significant increase of 4.7 years in for life expectancy relative to the matched general population now these data are in line with a previously published study which we covered on the channel and if you missed it it'll be in the right corner where men with a peak exercise capacity of 10 to 12 mets so this is a v2 max of 35 to 43 which were defined as fit and highly fit lived an average of 4.5 years longer relative to people who were in the lowest 20th percentile for v2 max and for people who were classified as extremely fit so the top two percentile they lived an average of 6 years longer when compared with the lowest 20% for v2 max all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links that you may be interested in including discount links for epigenetic testing ned quantification or microbiome composition atome metabolomics at home blood test testing with sciox health which includes apob and grimage green tea diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
