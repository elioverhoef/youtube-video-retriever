# Blood Test #1 in 2022: Supplements, Fitness, Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video we saw that my biological age when using morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator was 32.6 years which is 16.4 years younger than my chronological age and similarly when using aging.ai my biological age was 26 years which is 23 years younger than my chronological age now these data are important because they are both four years younger than my average phenoed reduction which prior to this test was 12 years younger so 16.4 years younger for the test in january of 2022 and for aging.ai age over 27 blood tests since 2016 my average aging.ai age was 30 years so this is also a four year reduction so what's impacting these data in terms of supplements fitness and diet so first let's have a look at supplements and the first two aren't anything new if you've watched previous videos in this series these shouldn't be a surprise so i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid-20s so i've been taking levothyroxine it was prescribed levothyroxine 135 137 and a half micrograms per day so i take that every day also for this blood test uh i took methyl b12 a thousand micrograms once every three days in an effort to limit my homocysteine but unfortunately it didn't impact my homocysteine at all so i've gotta look into my own data to see if whether i want to increase the methyl b12 amount or uh maybe even remove it again and then a new addition to the supplement stack if you if if this small amount is a stack was for the last 10 days of this period that corresponded to this blood test i included middle of the night melatonin uh 100 to 200 micrograms per day so i don't have problems falling asleep but sometime after i wake up in the middle of the night i have trouble going back to sleep and the more often that i wake up in the middle of the night it's harder to fall asleep so uh middle of the night melatonin has helped with that and there is actually some interesting data uh that may uh show better heart rate variability and resting heart rate uh data since i started taking it but i don't have enough data yet to make that video but uh that there's an interesting story developing so stay tuned for that so that's it in terms of supplements um what about fitness so we're test to test uh cardiovascular metrics including heart rate variability hrv and resting heart rate improved and if they were could that potentially explain this four year additional reduction for these biological ages so first let's take a look at heart rate variability again hrv for test number six in 2021 versus test number one in 2022 so for blood test number six in 2021 note that each of these black dots is for a single day and for the period that corresponded to that blood test it was a 40 to 42 day period similarly a 42 day period was for blood test number one in 2022 so before going there note that my average heart rate variability for test number six was 50.3 milliseconds so for the 42 day period for blood test number one in 2022 my average heart rate variability was 50.9 milliseconds and when using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data are not significantly different so from that we can conclude that there is no difference for heart rate variability when comparing this most recent test in 2022 with the last test in 2021 now before we leave the heart rate variability story aside note that i have a couple of outlier data as indicated there now although i did hit a a low for heart rate variability of 36 on in on another day on the the night that i got vaccine dose number three so the booster we can see that my heart rate variability went from an average of about 51 to 36 so that's about a 30 30 percent reduction so and we can clearly see that immune activation uh negatively affects uh cardiovascular fitness metrics at least heart rate variability so what about resting heart rate was wrestling heart rate potentially improved as a as a means for explaining this further reduction for biological age so here we're looking at resting heart rate for test number six in 2021 versus uh test number one in 2022 so starting with the data for test number six in 2021 again a 42 day period each stock corresponds to one day of data my average resting heart rate was 47.2 beats per minute now for test number one in 2022 my average resting heart it was 46.8 beats per minute and when using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data are not significantly different so from that we can conclude that there was no significant difference for resting heart rate test the test from the last test in 2021 to the first test in 2022 and when considering the heart rate variability data because these cardiovascular fitness metrics weren't different when comparing test number 6 and 21 versus test number 1 and 222 this likely didn't impact or an improvement in cardiovascular fitness didn't likely impact this biological age this further biological age reduction now before leaving the wrestling heart rate story again note that there are two outliers in my data and the biggest outlier with a resting heart rate of 60 was on the first night after vaccine dose number three and then that second arrow at a resting heart rate of 51 was the second night after the the vaccine booster so again we can see that immune activation leads to worse cardiovascular fitness metrics not just for resting heart rate but again for heart rate variability as i showed in the earlier data all right so what about body different a body weight was that different from test test as a potential uh explanation for how this further reduction in biological age and improvement in in the component biomarkers uh for each of these metrics uh so was body weight uh uh reduced from to uh test the test so here's body weight for test number six in 2021 versus test number one in 2022 and i weigh myself every morning after i go number one and number two so and i record that data in an excel spreadsheet so for the 42 day period that corresponds to blood test number six in 2021 my average body weight was exactly 155 pounds and for the 42 day period that corresponded to test number one 2022 it was a 154 pounds and when using a two-sample t-test these two groups are now significantly different so uh there was lower body weight for test number one in 2022 versus test number six in 2021 so body weight is affected by physical activity and calorie intake so were those different between tests so we're test the test levels of physical activity different uh from test number six and 21 versus test number one in 22. Now before going into that data note that uh many studies frequently use questionnaires self-report on questionnaires to indicate uh physical activity where people indicate how much physical activity that they do and step counters are an improvement over that but tracking steps doesn't doesn't account for the intensity of the effort so if i walk a thousand steps on a flat ground versus walking a thousand steps up a hill clearly walking up a hill is going to be a greater intensity and a greater greater physical exertion compared to walking the thousand steps on a flat ground so the in contrast the average daily heart rate is a better metric of daily physical activity when compared with both step counters and self-report on questionnaires so uh my fitness tracker and i should have mentioned that i wear a fitness tracker i'm not going to give them a shout out as i'm not sponsored but for those who don't know just leave a comment and i'll gladly answer which which one that i wear so uh the fitness tracker also provides the average daily heart rate so a full day heart rate and we can compare that data for test number six in 2021 versus test number one in 2022 so for the the last test in 2021 my average daily heart rate was 57.7 beats per minute and for test number one in 2022 it was 57 beats per minute now these two groups of data are not significantly different note that the p-value is approaching uh 0.05 they're less than 0.05 at 0.08 so it's close to being lower physical activity for this most recent blood test where compared with the last test in 2021 so from this we can conclude that physical activity was not different between these two tests now note that the ex the expectation would be higher activity as a means towards weight loss assuming that calorie intake was the same but i was close to less active for this most recent blood test when compared with the last test in 2021 so what about calorie intake was test to test calorie intake different and if you've ever wanted to see a deep dive into my diet get ready because there's going to be a lot of data about my diet as a potential explanation for this further reduction in biological age and these component biomarkers that contribute to the biological age calculation so first average daily calorie intake for test number six in 2021 versus task number one in 2022 and note that i weigh all my food i've documented this thoroughly in other videos but i weigh all my food with a food scale i then log that using an online app that i'm not sponsored by so again i'm not going to give them a shout out if anybody's curious that doesn't already know please leave a comment and i'll gladly address it and then i log all of that data into an excel spreadsheet and for each period dietary periods for this test it was 42 days i have an average dietary intake that i then line up with the blood test data and then with enough of both data i can look at correlations between diet with the blood biomarkers all right so average daily calorie intake for blood test number six in 2021 was calories per day and for test number one in 2022 it was less at 23.22 calories per day and when using a two-sample t-test on these two groups of data they are significantly different so from that we can conclude that there was a i significantly reduced my calorie intake for this most recent test when compared with the last test in 2021 so that then raises the quest question could a reduction for calorie intake explain some of this improvement for biological age for the most recent test versus the last test so to address that i then looked at correlations for calorie intake versus the 24 combined biomarkers on levine's test and aging.ii and note that levine's test includes nine biomarkers whereas aging.ii includes 19 so that total is 28 but there are there's an overlap for four biomarkers so thereby resulting in the 24 biomarkers so of those 24 4 are significantly associated with calorie intake triglycerides platelets rdw and ldl and as we can see by the r the little r the correlation coefficient a relatively higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher triglycerides platelets rdw and ldl note that the n is how many blood tests that have dietary data that corresponds to each of the blood tests so we can see for triglycerides triglycerides for example i have 35 blood tests since 2015 since i started tracking diet now note that a 51 calorie cut test the test may not seem like much but each of these four biomarkers improved from the test last test in 2021 through the first test in 2022 which is what we can see here so triglycerides went down from 61 to 55 platelets 224 to 216 rdw 12.6 to 12.2 and ldl 86 to 75. So a very small calorie cut may have impacted these small improvements for each of these four biomarkers now calorie intake doesn't account for the macronutrient composition of the diet so was test to test macro macronutrient composition different so for that let's start with average daily fat average daily fat intake for test number six in 21 versus test number one in 22 so for the last test in 2021 my average daily fat intake was about 94 grams per day and for the first test in 2022 it was about 80 84 grams per day and these two groups of data are significantly different so uh so from that we can conclude that there was a significantly reduced fat intake for the first test in 2022 versus the last test in 2021. So why did i do that why did i cut my fat intake by an average of 10 grams per day so the main reason for the dietary fat reduction for this test was to try to reduce fasting glucose so why did i think that was going to happen so prior to this test glucose was my blood glucose levels were greater than 90 mil greater than or equal to 90 milligrams per deciliter for 15 consecutive blood tests so here we can see glucose plotted on the y axis against time since 2015. And uh over the past as you can see it but with the red rectangle over the past 15 tests glucose was greater than or equal to 90. And then adding going further we can see that glucose was increasing over that same time time period which is clearly going in the wrong direction as higher glucose increases during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk so to address how to reduce glucose i then looked at correlations for macronutrients with my own glucose data and that's what we can see here this is what the data looked like prior to this blood test and of the these macronutrients carbohydrate fiber fat and protein the strongest correlation with fasting glucose in my data was for fat intake and more specifically a relatively higher fat intake was significantly correlated with higher blood glucose so then the next question is was glucose reduced in conjunction with the lower fat intake for this test so for that i then looked at correlations with a total fat intake with with each of the combined 24 biomarkers on phenoage and aging.ai and of those there were significant correlations for uh red blood cells glucose ldl the percentage of lymphocytes mcv blood urea nitrogen bun and platelets with total fat intake so going straight to the glucose data so now we can see that i have 33 blood test measurements in comparison with the 32 on the right side uh so we can see that and i should also mention that the correlation for total fat intake stayed exactly the same from the last blood test to this blood test but now we can see that my glucose levels for the first time in 16 tests have returned to the 80s so thankfully and cutting cutting fat intake may be one factor that contributed to it especially when considering it's relatively strong correlation with fasting glucose but cutting fat intake by 10 grams per day didn't just improve glucose we can see that my red blood cells improved the ldl also improved in association or in correlation with the reduced fat intake and platelets also improved uh as in correlation with the 10 gram cut for fat intake now note that there is basically no change for uh three biomarkers so percentage of lymphocytes 43 to 42.5 is essentially the same similarly mcv 88 to 87.8 essentially the same and bloody nitrogen 10 to 10 didn't change test over test so in addition to lower glucose reducing fat intake was correlated with improved red blood cells or levels of red blood cells ldl and platelets so um all all dietary fat is not the same we can then subdivide fat into monounsaturated fatty acids mufa polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa and saturated fatty acids sfa so which fats did i cut so here we're looking at fat intake uh from the last test in 2021 blood test number six and the first test in 2022 and then evaluating statistical significance between these two groups of data the 42 day period for blood test number six versus the 42 day period for blood test number one in 2022 so i've already shown you that the fat intake was significantly different from this test when compared to lap to the last test about a 10 gram cut and then most most of that cut comes from monounsaturated fatty acids so 24 grams per day to about 16 grams per day and then if we look just only at polyunsaturated fatty acids there was no significant difference but when we subdivide pufa into its components omega-3 and omega-6 we can see that i ate more omega-3 whereas omega-6 was not different test the test and similarly total saturated fatty acids were not different from test the test so then the big question should be why did i cut monounsaturated fatty acids for the first test in 2022 when compared with the last test in 2021 and the primary reason for that is because relatively higher levels of mono and monounsaturated fatty acids in my data were significantly associated or are still significantly associated with the correlated sorry with higher levels relatively high levels of glucose which is what we can see there so over 33 blood tests since 2015 we can see that that correlation for mufal with glucose is uh increasing so that's going in the wrong direction so that's one the main reason why i cut monounsaturated fatty acids uh for this test and there's a bud so saturated fatty acid intake is also significantly correlated with higher glucose in my data which is what we can see here glucose on the y-axis plotted against saturated fatty acid content in grams per day on the x-axis and we can see that over 33 blood 33 blood tests since 2015 we can see with that correlation coefficient of 0.63 that's a relatively stronger correlation than mufa so saturated fatty acids correlation with glucose is stronger than it is for mufa so why didn't i cut saturated fatty acids for test number 1 and 22. You can see it's not significantly different when compared with test number 6 and 20 20 21. So note that all saturated fatty acids are not the same for their carbon chain length for this test i reduced cheese intake which contains longer chain saturated fatty acids and replaced it with coconut butter which contains medium chain fatty acids so that's why the saturated fat fatty acids looks the same test over test but i changed the amounts of the uh you know less of the long chain saturated fatty acids and more of these medium chain saturated fatty acids than coconut butter so why did i cut cheese intake so full fat dairy in my data is significantly correlated with higher glucose and when i say full fat dairy that includes cheese and full fat yogurt and when when we look at both of these foods in a regression model against glucose that model is statistically significant the correlation for those two with glucose is statistically significant and individually within that model we can see that both cheese and full fat yogurt are significantly correlated with higher glucose so i may have some issue with dairy saturated fatty acids that impacts my glucose levels so uh for this test i reduced my cheese intake and it's been a few tests that i took out the full fat yogurt and replaced it with low-fat yogurt so also why did i increase omega-3 intake so a relatively higher omega-3 intake is significantly correlated with lower creatinine in my data which is what we can see here creatinine on the y-axis plotted against average daily omega-3 intake in grams per day on the x-axis and as you can see by that downward trend uh there's a significant uh so higher levels of omega-3 are correlated with lower creatinine and again that's over 35 blood tests since 2015. So to test causation i increased omega-3 for this test with uh increasing omega-3 with more flaxseeds and sardines and note that for this test creatinine was reduced from 1.02 on the last test in 2021 to 0.94 milligrams per deciliter to this test in 2022 now whether that's causation it's still unknown i mean this is still correlation but at least creatinine went in the right direction with this increase in omega-3 for this test so what about differences for other macronutrients vitamins minerals and overall diet composition so in terms of mac other macronutrients that's we've we've got here so with data for blood test number six in 2021 versus the data for blood test number one in 2022 on the right and then p-value to evaluate statistical significance so first in terms of total protein intake i reduced my protein intake by a small amount 5.5 grams per day and that was a statistically significant reduction test over test so note that i did that on purpose because a relatively higher protein intake in my data is significantly correlated with higher glucose so it may not just be the total fat reduction it may also be a relatively lower protein intake a small cut that contributed to the lower glucose for this test now fiber test over test was not significantly different 86 grams in both dietary periods i have starch indicated here but i don't track that in my excel file so i didn't use a two-sample t-test to evaluate statistical significance between tests but then i do track sugar intake and more specifically total fructose intake which includes fructose obviously but also sucrose divided by two as sucrose equals fructose bound to glucose so my total fructose intake was uh i made a small reduction of three 3.4 grams per day for this most recent test when compared with the last test in 2021 and i did that in part because a relatively higher fructose intake in my data is correlated with lower hdl which is going in the wrong direction now for this test that 65 grams per day of total fructose may seem like a lot to many people but for me that's actually my lowest intake since 2015 and i love eating fruit uh so this is you know i'm going to continue to try to make small cuts over time to see how low i can reduce it and to see if i can correspondingly increase my hdl and then in terms of net carbs it was right on the border or pretty close to the border for statistical significance for a higher carb intake of about 10 grams for this test when compared with the last test in 2021 and that's important because a relatively higher carb intake in my data is significantly correlated with lower glucose and again that may that might seem paradoxical to many because when they think of carbs they think of sugars cookies and cakes and this is a very minor component of my diet when i mentioned carbs this is from you know whole foods whole grains fruits and vegetables all right so what about differences for vitamins test over test so we've got all of the vitamins listed here and i'm only going to highlight the ones that were significantly different when comparing blood test number six in 2021 versus test number one in 2022 so first thiamin intake b1 was a little bit higher for this test when compared to the last test in 2021 most likely because of the increased barley and flax seeds but i wasn't purposely trying to increase my b1 intake what i did purposely try to affect was vitamin a and more specifically beta-carotene which is what we can see were both significantly different and a little bit lower for this test when compared with the last test in 2021 so vitamin a was about 5 000 i used lower and beta carotene was about 2 000 micrograms lower for this test when compared with the last test in 2021. So why did i cut beta-carotene intake so a relatively higher beta-carotene intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose in my data and that's over 33 tests since 2015. So again just to reinforce this issue it may not just have been the total fat intake a small cut in protein a little bit higher total carb intake and a little bit a small cut for beta carotene all of which are significantly correlated with my glucose levels may have contributed to getting glucose back in the 80s for the first time in 16 tests so also different for this test when compared with the last test was a little bit higher of a vitamin c intake i didn't purposely go after vitamin c for this test though so that's just a note a little bit higher of a vitamin d intake and that's probably because of the small increase for sardines but other than that the rest of these vitamins were not different test over test so what about differences for minerals so that's we've got here all the major minerals listed on the left and then we've got data for test number six in 2021 on the left next to the minerals and then data for test number one in 2022 on the right and then the p-value for whether these two groups of data are significantly different using a two-sample t-test so first note that calcium was uh significantly lower for this test and i purposely went after a lower calcium intake for this test more specifically by reducing the cheese intake so it shouldn't be a surprise that calcium was reduced because i reduced cheese intake and the reason i wanted to also reduce calcium and calcium intake is because a relatively higher calcium intake is also significantly correlated with a higher glucose in my data in it and again that's over 33 tests since 2015. So just to reinforce that that point so now we've got total fat a little bit a lower protein intake a little bit lower beta-carotene intake a little bit higher higher carb intake oh and now also a little bit lower calcium intake each of each with our are significantly correlated with glucose in my data uh so reducing all of those uh with the exception of uh carbohydrate intake may have led to that reduction in glucose and then other differences that i didn't intend to affect for this blood test were potassium which was reduced by significantly reduced by 400 milligrams per day a small increase for selenium of about 13 micrograms per day and that's likely because uh the barley and sardines also contain selenium so that's probably why it was a little bit higher i did reduce my brazil nut intake from about five grams to four grams to account for that so it would have been even higher if i hadn't uh you know made a small adjustment to my brazil brazil nut intake and then also zinc was two milligrams lower but again i didn't purposely go ask to go after zinc for this blood test and then the rest of the minerals no significant difference test over test all right what about differences for overall food intake so complete food composition so here we've got dietary composition for the top 26 foods ranked in terms of grams per day for this dietary period that led to for blood test number one in 2022 when compared with the last period for test number 6 in 2021 so atop the list for this period for the most recent test are strawberries and again this wasn't intentional i usually get a three-berry mix from costco that includes frozen strawberries blueberries and blackberries and they were out of that so i couldn't buy it but they did have strawberries so to get my daily dose of berries i loaded up on strawberries every day uh whereas in the past it was a mix of the blackberries blueberries and strawberries so correspondingly whereas strawberries are higher for this dietary period and blackberries and blueberries are lower as indicated by the red arrows we can see that they're lower compared to the last dietary period the last test in 2021 where blackberries and blueberries were higher so i'm probably going to stick with the strawberries going forward just because they're a component of this uh essentially quote-unquote great data that you know for biological agent each of the component biomarkers uh so i'm trying to keep the data the same to see if i can replicate it for the next test or keep the diet the same so i can see if i can replicate the bio biomarker data for the next test all right other major differences were carrots as i mentioned to get that very small cut for beta-carotene so i reduce carrot intake by about 20 grams per day and then other differences were corn as we can see i increased it there by about 30 grams per day which was some of that increased carbohydrate intake so green green arrow would compare with the black hour on the right and then uh barley too i increased my barley intake to also get a little bit higher of a carb intake so to try to keep my calorie intake you know uh somewhere without making too large of a cut so i cut my fat intake i cut my protein intake by small amounts so i didn't want to cut my calorie intake by too much so i increased uh intake of corn and barley to make up some of that caloric deficit and then also notice the increase in sardines to get more omega-3 so there was about a 20 gram plus 20 gram plus increase for sardines for this blood test relative to the last blood test and then coconut butter uh which at 22 grams per day on the left you can see it didn't make the top 25 26 foods for the last blood test in 2021 and then note that uh conversely avocado and cheese at more than 50 grams per day for the last test in 2021 didn't make the top 26 foods for the blood test uh that i just had in january so finishing out the diet so blood test number one to 20 22 on the left versus blood test number six in 2021 on the right uh note that uh coconut butter whereas it was 22 grams per day for this test for the last test it was only four and a half grams per day so i increased it by about 100 calories per day or about 15 grams for this test compared with the last test now also note the avocado and cheese which in for blood test number six in 2021 were more than 50 grams per day to get the reduction in monounsaturated fatty acids i mostly cut avocado and then to reduce as i mentioned cheese intake you can see i reduce it from more than 50 grams per day to only about three grams per day and then in terms of junk i i usually try to eat junk uh for each um dietary period on the day after me immediately after the blood test is kind of a celebration you know i just had the blood test this time eat a little bit of junk and the day after and after that i shut it down so if i don't test again for six weeks or two months i usually shut it down in terms of no more junk uh until the next blood test but for this dietary period you know i went to go see my parents who live in new york so when traveling from boston to new york we stopped in connecticut which in new haven connecticut they have uh supposedly some of the best pizza in the united states so i had a couple slices of that so that's that's you know that's an outlier i usually don't have junk more often than once or twice after the blood test so this is an outlier where i had a couple slices of pizza for the dietary period that corresponded to this blood test now also in terms of junk as i mentioned immediately after the blood test and the day after uh the junk that i've had for a few blood tests in around it has been nutella mixed with peanut butter uh you know making homemade reese's peanut butter cups and although i mistakenly uh i forgot i didn't add it for some reason for the blood test number six in 2021 so we can see i added it there so test over test my nutella intake was the same with an average of four grams per day so actually we can calculate that i ate about 170 grams of nutella for the first two days after the blood test for each of these blood tests so test number six in 2021 i had 160 grams then shut it down until the next test and then on the the day of the blood test for test number one in 2022 and the day after i had again 160 grams of nutella and then didn't have anything else for the 40 day period and well yeah i didn't have anything after that all right so then also note flax seeds as i mentioned increased omega-3 intake we can see 14 grams for this test versus only 33 grams for test number six in 2021 and then last but not least on this list that i'd like to highlight is turmeric so 1.8 grams for this test versus 0.7 grams per day for test number 6 in 2021 so more than two and a half fold increase for turmeric so why did i increase turmeric intake for this test uh when compared with test number six in 2021 so a higher turmeric intake is significantly correlated with lower high sensitivity c-reactive protein in my data which is shown here so high sensitivity c reactive protein on the y axis plotted against turmeric intake or average turmeric intake in grams per day on the x-axis and we can see that significant correlation there with a correlation coefficient of negative 0.55 so over 18 tests we can see that a relatively higher turmeric intake again is significantly correlated with lower crp now it's important to mention that no macro or micronutrients in my data for those 18 blood tests are significantly correlated with crp and in terms of foods only three are significantly correlated total nuts and seeds which i couldn't increase for this test because i was trying to limit total fat intake and then turmeric and black pepper which also uh i should mention that black pepper intake at 0.5 grams per day was also increased when compared with the last test in 2021 so uh for that's that could be one reason why my crc reacted protein for this test was at uh less than 0.3 milligrams per liter which is pretty low and it's lower than my average value over those 18 tests of somewhere around 0.5 and last but last but not least rounding out the diet so food number 53 for this test was closed at 0.2 grams per day all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check
