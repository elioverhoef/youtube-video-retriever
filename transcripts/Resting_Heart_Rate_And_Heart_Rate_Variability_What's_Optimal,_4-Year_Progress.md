## Transcript

In an earlier video we saw that there may be blind spots for blood-based biological age calculators for example the cardiovascular fitness metrics resting heart rate rhr and heart rate variability hrv are not included so with that in mind what's optimal for resting heart rate and heart rate variability and how's my four year progress so first how does the resting heart rate change during aging so this is data for whoop this is the fitness tracker that i wear i'm not currently sponsored by them but that's what i've been using since august of 2018 and we can see that the resting heart rate for both women in red and men in blue increases during aging at least from the 20 to 50 year age range so what about at older ages so this is data for fitbit users and up to 50 years we can see the same trend that resting heart rate increases for both men and women but then after around 50 years we can then see that the resting heart rate declines up to the 85 year age range so with that in mind note that relatively low resting heart rates are found in both young and in the aged so is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging so the heart rate variability hrv again provides more context so what is the heart rate variability hrv so the simple definition is that it's the variability for the time in between heartbeats so with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute the assumption is that it beats exactly once every second but that's not necessarily true so the variability for the time in between beats is the hrv so how does heart rate variability change during aging so this is data from a study of more than 8.2 million subjects and we're looking at the rmssd which is the version of heart rate variability that whoop measures over the 20 to 60 year age range and we can see that heart rate variability clearly declines during during aging at least for this age range from values approaching 80 in youth in 20 year olds to values less than 40 in 60 year olds now note that that data is early in the morning at six in the morning so if the heart rate variability is recorded later at night at six at night you can see that it's lower as indicated by the dash red and blue lines so to address the question is a relatively low resting heart rate indicative of youth or aging let's bring back our plot for resting heart rate as shown there so note that in youth and more specifically 20 year olds that's characterized by relatively low resting heart rate and a high heart rate variability in contrast in older ages in this case 60 years old which is uh which overlaps for both plots we can see that 60 year olds would have a relatively higher resting heart rate and a lower heart rate variability now note that i've tracked resting heart rate and heart rate variability since august of 2018 so i have 1 360 days of data so have i been able to resist these age-related changes for both cv metrics so starting with data for the resting heart rate and again this is from august of 2018 through april the end of april 2022 so the end of q1 2022 so that data is here and i've got it broken down by year and each dot corresponds to a single day for the resting heart rate from over that time span so each dot corresponds to a single day of data so in 2018 when i first started tracking these metrics my average uh daily resting heart rate was around 51 beats per minute now note that at no point uh was i sedentary i've it my whole life i've been active it's a very small periods of my life have i ever been uh sedentary so this value 50.1 50.9 i was physically active so what happened to 2019 so in 2019 my average resting heart rate for the full year was 48.9 and we can compare if these two groups of data are statistically different by using a two-sample t-test and when i did that we can see that 2019's data is significantly lower than 2018 so i was able to reduce my resting heart rate year over year 2019 versus 2018. Similarly in 2020 resting heart rate continued to decline 48.1 and using the two-sample t-test we can see that 2020 data was significantly lower than 2018 and also 2020 resting heart rate data was lower than 2019 all right in 2021 further reduction for the resting heart rate down to 47.4 beats per minute and that value was significantly lower than 2018 using the two-sample t-test and also lower than 2020 data again using a two-sample t-test so what about in 2022 at least through the end of april q1 2022 so so far this year my average resting heart rate is 45.7 beats per minute which is significantly lower than from where i started uh in 2018 and also significantly lower than 2021. So from this we can see that i've consistently reduced my resting heart rate over that almost 1400 day span all right so in terms of aging is this resting heart rate reduction going in the right or wrong direction so for that we go back to our plot as shown there and first note that from over the 20 to 50 year age range the resting heart rate increases during aging so thus far i've been able to resist that age-related increase for resting heart rate one should expect that my resting heart rate would have increased at least up to 50 years since my chronological age is currently 49 i'll be 50 next year all right now also note that a relatively low resting heart rate uh could be found in youth there's a there's a typo there shouldn't be the of shouldn't be there sorry about that could be found in youth but also in advanced age as shown there so for more context whether this is uh good or bad it whether it's indicative of youth or aged let's have a look at heart rate variability since 2018 and that's what's shown here again each stock corresponds to a single day of data and that's almost 1400 days of data since august of 2018. So when i first started tracking these metrics my average daily heart rate variability was for around 47.3 or it was 47.3 milliseconds so around 47 and then i was able to increase that in 2019 and using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data were significantly different so a significantly higher heart rate variability in 2019 versus 2018. Similarly in 2020 it further increased to 57.8 was that significantly different compared to 2018 it was as shown there but was 2020 data a significant increase over 2019 and as shown by the t-test it's close to significance but it's not statistically significant a p-value less than 0.05 would be significant in this case it's a little bit outside that so 2019 versus 2020 similar heart rate variability data it's not a significant increase that small bump from 56 to around 58. All right and then 20 in 2021 i had a regression for heart rate variability the average for the year was around 52 milliseconds more more specifically 51.9 and the 51.9 fortunately is higher than when i started in 2018 but uh significantly lower than 2020 data so 2021 was a bad year for heart rate variability now i don't like for any part of my approach to get worse especially heart rate variability or wrestling heart rate so in 2022 an obvious goal would be to restore or improve heart rate variability uh and resting heart rate and all the other metrics to reverse this 2021 decline so what about 2022 data so thus far in this year over the first four months my heart rate variability is average is 54.3 milliseconds and that is significantly higher than where i started in 2018 and it's also significantly higher when compared with 2021 data so off to a good start in reversing that uh regression in 2021 for heart rate variability so uh the net effect though is that since 2018 i've been able to increase my heart rate variability over this uh almost four year span so how do these data compare with age related changes for heart rate variability so let's bring back this plot so the expected median heart rate heart rate variability based on my chronological age ca is about 35 milliseconds so when considering that my heart rate variability my average daily heart rate variability for 2022 is 54 right now that will put me at worst at the high end of the heart rate variability range for my chronological age at best it could be a a heart rate variability of 54 milliseconds is the median heart rate variability for someone 17 years younger so it could be better than just being above average for my age group now note that a relatively high heart rate variability and a low resting heart rate in my case suggest cardiovascular youth in contrast a lower heart rate variability plus a higher resting heart rate would be expected based on my chronological age so what's contributing to these improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability so let's start off by looking at body weight changes over this almost four year span and its potential impact on these cv metrics so here we're looking at my average monthly body weight so each dot corresponds to the average for an individual month over that same time span that we that i use to look at both heart rate variability and wrestling heart rate now note that i record my body weight every morning after number one or two and fasted so that i minimize some of the variability inherent in whether or not i went one or two or if i was fasted or not so i started this journey about four years ago with a higher body weight almost 160 and i'm currently now have an average daily body weight somewhere around 152. So what's the relationship for body weight with resting heart rate and we can see that data here this is the average monthly resting heart rate over the same approximate four year time span now note that the two curves seem somewhat overlapping or at least the trends seem very similar so when body weight declines so does resting heart rate and when body weight increases so does resting heart rate so we can look at that correlation more specifically by looking at the individual data points not looking at monthly data but the individual data points for resting heart rate versus body weight over that almost 1400 day span and that's what we can see here and more specifically we can see that as as body weight increases wrestling heart rate significantly increases as shown there by the correlation and statistically significant p-value now conversely as body weight approaches 150 pounds my resting heart rate approaches 45 beats per minute now obviously as we can see by the plot i don't have data yet below 150 so i'm working on uh getting there slowly um so stay tuned for that in the upcoming in upcoming videos all right so what about heart rate variability what's the relationship for body weight with that and that's what we can see here so it doesn't look like the plot for resting heart rate at all and there's more variability in this measurement no pun intended when compared with the resting heart rate so declines in body weight are not always matched by improvements for rest for heart rate variability so looking at it more specifically each individual data point for heart rate variability versus uh each day for body weight over that same about four year span we can see that as body weight increases that's correlated significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability as shown by the red arrow and conversely as my body weight approaches 150 pounds heart rate variability approaches youthful levels or relatively really relatively youthful levels of 60 milliseconds so to answer this question what's the relationship for body weight with these cv metrics we can see that my wrestling heart rate and heart rate variability approach youthful values as my body weight decreases so what about physical activity that should be the other obvious choice to look at for its potential impact on these cv metrics so to address that i'm going to look at data for the average daily heart rate and that's an index of daily physical activity so a higher average and i should mention that woo provides this data so i record it just manually into an excel file so a higher average daily heart rate equals more physical activity and also more overall stress as you know stress can affect your heart rate so if you have more overall stress even without exercise that can impact your overall average heart rate for that day now conversely a lower average daily heart rate equals less physical activity plus less overall stress on that day so with that in mind what's the correlation for the average daily heart rate with next day resting heart rate and we can see that here and note that this is 760 days of data uh two full years of data from april 2020 to the end of april 2022. I didn't have unfortunately i didn't have the idea to start tracking this metric and i can't retroactively go back past april of 2020 because just whoop doesn't provide that data so what we can see is that the higher the more active that i am the worse than that or the you know our the uh morning the next morning sorry the next morning resting heart rate increases as shown by the significant correlation between those two those two outcomes so from this we can conclude that too much daily activity and too often may be bad for resting heart rate at least in my case so what about the correlation for the average daily heart rate with next day heart rate variability and we can see that here and the data is now a negative correlation a significant negative correlation so in other words as daily activity increases my next morning heart rate variability significantly decreases so once again this suggests that too much daily activity and too often not incorporating enough rest days may be bad for my next day heart rate variability so finding the balance between how often to be active and how often to have rest days is is important for optimizing these two metrics now for me i'm currently on a three-day cycle where i incorporate a high activity day as indicated by the average daily heart rate a medium so a lower value and then a relatively lower average daily heart rate and then i repeat the cycle on day four and that seems to be working pretty well for me for being able to uh you know somewhat optimize these cv metrics now uh last but not least what percentage of the variability in these two cardiovascular metrics can be explained by the combination of uh average daily heart rate so physical activity and body weight so to do that i i constructed multivariate models in this case we're looking at wrestling heart rate and its association or correlation overall correlation with the average daily heart rate and body weight so the combination of these two these two metrics so average daily physical activity and body weight is significantly associated with the resting heart rate as shown there by the significance f and more specifically we can see that the average daily heart rate and body weight explain 26 percent of the variability in resting heart rate which is a pretty pretty large amount as we'll see in a minute compared to how much of this is explained for heart rate variability now the question then is what this the other 74 what is what is uh explaining that wrestling hari what what things can contribute to 74 of the variability and resting heart rate so uh i look at diet as i've done before in in in an upcoming video not sooner but probably later to see how much of that can explain the variability in resting heart rate all right so what about the heart rate variability so once again looking at average daily physical activity and body weight for their collective association with heart rate variability we can see that this is a significant model so the average daily physical activity and body weight are significantly associated with heart rate variability but in contrast to the resting heart rate data we can see that average daily physical activity and body weight only explain five percent of the variability in heart rate variability which means that 95 percent of other stuff is contributing to variability and heart rate variability so discovering that may be one means for further optimizing it so i'm constantly on the hunt to try to figure out what's what's influencing what so stay tuned for that uh that analysis in future videos all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
