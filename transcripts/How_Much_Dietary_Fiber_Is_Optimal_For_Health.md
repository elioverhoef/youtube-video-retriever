How much dietary fiber is optimal for health to address that let's take a look at a meta analysis of 14 studies that included more than 1.3 million people on the x- axis we've got total fiber intake in grams per day and on the y- axis we've got the hazard ratio for all cause mortality or all cause mortality risk and here in this dose response meta analysis we can see that as fiber increased up to 40 gram per day that was significantly associated with a 45% reduced risk for all cause mortality but is this just healthy user bias in other words do people who eat relatively high fiber diets are they just generally healthier overall thereby accounting for this effect so to address that these studies were adjusted for factors that can impact the association for fiber with all cause mortality risk as shown here which included bmi smoking age alcohol drinking physical activity energy or calorie intake and sex so we can see that at a minimum eight of the four 14 studies in the meta analysis included adjustment for sex and at most bmi was adjusted in all 14 of the studies so a lot of the factors that can impact this these this association were accounted for in this study but notably absent are sugar sweetened beverages which as we saw in the last video are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk so do people who eat high fiber diets just eat less junk as a potential explanation for this association and we can see that only one of the 14 studies adjusted for sugar sweetened beverage intake along those lines none of the 14 studies adjusted their models for ultr processed food intake which is also associated with poor health so hopefully future iterations of studies like this will incl include adjustment for factors like sugar sweetened beverages and ultra processed food intake to see if it's a healthy user bias or this is a real effect all right so these data don't tell us fiber from what and this study went into further detail by looking at fiber from legumes vegetables fruit and whole grains so let's take a look at that data starting with the data for legumes as they have the most hype around them as a quote unquote pro- longevity food so let's see what the data has to say on the x-axis we've got legum fiber in grams per day intake in grams per day once again plotted against the hazard ratio for all cause mortality or all cause mortality risk and here this is a metaanalysis of four studies that included more than 221,000 people so as legum fiber intakes increased up to 4 gram per day that wasn't significantly associated with all cause mortality risk as we can see that their 95% confidence interval that's the data in the dashed black lines completely overlaps with the red line which is a hazard ratio of one so it's not a significant association up to four gram of lagum fiber per day but at 5 gram of legum fiber per day we can see that that is a significant association as its two dash black lines are completely below that hazard ratio of one so in other words fiber intake from legumes 5 g per day is associated with a 12% reduced risk for all cause mortality now as an example of how we can get 5 grams of legum fiber into our diets just using one example there are many different ways chickpeas in their dry weight 40 41 gram of chickpeas per day yields 5 grams of fiber at a cost of a 155 calories all right next up is vegetable fiber which is what we can see on the x axis in grams per day once again plotted against all cause mortality risk on the y axis and this is a meta analysis of five studies that included more than 674 th000 people so here there was significant reduced all cause mortality risk starting at 7.5 gram of vegetable fiber per day but maximally reduced all cause mortality risk was at 15 gram of vegetable fiber per day and that's because what we can see that it's 95% confidence interval again the two dash black lines are completely below that hazard ratio of one the red line such that 15 gr of vegetable fiber per day was associated with a 35% reduced all cause mortality risk so just as one example for how we can get 15 grams of vegetable fiber per day just using broccoli as one example but it can be a mix of many different vegetables about a pound of broccoli per day yields 15 grams of fiber at a cost of 158 calories all right next up is serial fiber which is what we've got on the x-axis all cause mortality risk again on the y- ais and this is a meta analysis of seven studies that included up to 1.1 million people so here we can see that there was a significantly reduced all cause mortality risk starting at 3.5 gram of serial fiber per day as we can see that's where its two dash black lines the 95% confidence interval is below the hazard ratio of one but we can see that a maximally reduced alla mortality risk was associated with whole grain or serial fiber intakes of seven grams of fiber per day as shown there so from this we can see that seven grams of whole grain fiber per day was associated with a 22% reduced risk for all cause mortality what about at higher whole grain fiber intakes and we can see that up to 10 gram per day the upper bound for its 95% confidence interval is significantly associated with reduced all cause mortality risk as it's below that red line the hazard ratio of one but note that the risked uction is similar to 7 g per day in other words the association for all cause mortality risk at 7 g of whole grain fiber per day is similar to to the 10 gram intake of whole grain fiber per day all right so in terms of how we can get whole grain seven grams at least seven grams per day of whole grain fiber into our diets just using again one example steel cut oats in dry weight 70 gram yields 7 gram of fiber at a cost of 265 calories all right next up is fruit fiber which is on the x-axis all cos mortality again or risk on the y ais and this is a met meta analysis of five studies that included more than 674 th000 people so here we can see that maximally reduced all cause mortality risk was present at four grams of fruit fiber per day as shown there you can see again that the dash black lines are completely below that hazard ratio of one at four grams per day so that was associated with a 21% reduced all cause mortality risk so what about at higher fruit fiber intakes so at 8 g of fruit fiber per day we can see that the dash black line the upper bound for the dash black line the 95% confidence interval overlaps with the hazard ratio of one the red line so that's not a significant association and we can see that that's true for all fruit fiber intakes above 8 grams per day actually probably about seven grams per day so just as one example for how we can get at least four grams of fruit fiber per day 200 gram of strawberries yield four grams of fiber at a cost of s 7 70 calories all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and
