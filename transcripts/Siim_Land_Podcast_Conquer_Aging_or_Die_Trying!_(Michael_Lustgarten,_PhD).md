## Transcript

Dr michael welcome to the show thanks seem how you doing i'm doing great yeah and i'm really excited to talk with you because you know you have like an amazing youtube channel where you've uh documented all these different like experiments you've done on yourself and all the studies as well correlating with you know biological age and actual chronological age and mortality risk and all those things so it's yeah like a really good database and uh resource for just people to check out okay like what is the things that actually matter in terms of mortality risk when we're talking about you know different biomarkers or dietary practices and all those things and like you know there's very few people who have you know like you say in a lot of the video videos that you've tracked all your food for the last you know six years or so or more and all the power biomarkers as well for like 15 years so it's yeah like really glad to talk with you and share some insight to people yeah thanks team so just real quick uh when i was growing up i started off with the bodybuilder magazines and i'm still obviously into fitness uh you know but that's another story that's a tangent but back then jacqueline was a big iconic fitness figure and he would always say things like eat real food and exercise so for the longest time that was the motto right but then i thought there's got to be a higher level what is the higher level to this and that involves you know objective biomarkers right like blood markers things like blood pressure um as many objective objectively measured biomarkers as possible so if we track that over time with the goal of slowing down age-related changes and and uh you know what does that recipe look like in terms of how much exercise what's an optimal body weight uh what macros and micros so yeah that's that's been the journey yeah exactly and you know i'm glad to see a lot more focus on that when we're talking about you know longevity and aging because you know when i grew up you know which is like you know 10 years ago or 15 years ago that when i was you know first exposed to content online about fitness or health and stuff then you know there wasn't back then there wasn't like a lot of scientific or people didn't back up their claims a lot with science and data and stuff like that and at the end of the day that's what matters the most like you know you can have you know let's say for example even like the most studies or something you have some results in a mouse study but in humans it might be completely different uh or like some people say that hey this that is the best but actually their blood work is worse than what we know is optimal then uh you know that that means a lot the actual like data and actual you know outcome and i think unfortunately so many people are using animal studies and even rcts done in other people you know uh and then saying oh it worked in those studies i'm going to take it for myself but then that you know that's great that's better than doing nothing but then like you said objective biomarkers does it even work for you is it even improving your net sum of biomarkers and i think too a limitation there is a lot of people are focused on metabolic health so glucose lipids and then they forget about everything else and i don't want to put any you know uh anybody on blast but i see that a lot and the fact is they forget it forget about kidney health liver health and you know immune cells maybe they focus on inflammation but the fact is maybe you won't die from adverse metabolic health granted that's an important thing to focus on but every organ system is going to decline during aging and neglecting one or many i think is a you know fallacious approach so i try to cover them all uh granted that said i have deficiencies in that approach i haven't tried to regrow hair and slow that down but that's not going to kill me uh and you know maybe my skin health i could spend more time on that but you know it's it's it becomes it can become a full-time job uh which i just don't yet have that time for you know so yeah but right yeah that's that's true there's a lot of things that go wrong but you know the biggest thing is just staying alive like i said before without a recording but uh yeah so how did you like what when did it begin and what was like what's the journey like what was the first thing you started with and you know you can maybe how to where are we not right now where are you right now with your journey and your progress and what your results so far yeah so uh in terms of tracking blood biomarkers that's been going on for 2008 2007 once a year just general checkup i'd record all of my data in an excel file and you know i've heard you say ah i test once a year but to be totally honest it's not enough right because is it well is it enough if it is enough if that one test per year is representative of the whole year and from my experience that's not generally true because for example in the summer i suffer from seasonal allergies and it hits me so hard i get an immune activation which is quantifiable with fitness metrics that look like i'm infected with covet which is ridiculous it's just grass and pollen so if i only measured all of the other times of the year and never saw that data in the in the summer months i would think that my health is fantastic you know or vice versa if i only measured in the june months or june july and never measured anywhere else i would i would i wouldn't know right so i think having regular repeated measurements uh i've test tested seven times per year last year i'm on pace for the same amount this year i work with people who do it 12 times a year which i'm not ready for that yet but all right so that said i started off doing once a year and then 2008 till about 2015 that's what i was doing even sometimes i skipped a year which wasn't great but then 2015 for whatever reason i had the idea i need to kick this up i need to really get this into hyperdrive this isn't enough i'm not being scientific about it so i started tracking my diet every day weighing literally everything and um i don't generally eat out much so it was pretty easy to do that back then and i still don't generally eat out much so still easy to do that now but i started recording everything in terms of diet and so if i blood test on day one and i blood test on day 60 now i have an average dietary intake over those 59 days so i take the average dietary intake for that period which now lines up with that blood test so each blood test now has an average dietary intake so with each subsequent blood test i have data that can be correlated so once i got past four five six blood tests i started looking at correlations in my diet now i mean everything um actually i started off with just macros and micros and then sometime in 2018 i thought this isn't representative either i need to start tracking food intake because i'm assuming that everything in food can be reduced down to you know macros and microbes which may not be true so uh eventually i started tracking all of that and looking at correlations and um in trying different things in that approach you know going to a higher fat you know 115 grams per day which is high for me going to a lower fat 65 grams higher protein 150 grams lower protein 60 grams having a range of that data since 2015 and following the correlations and not just following one correlation it's you know i've got or um biomarkers of kidney and liver and immune cells as many as the standard um you know biomarkers on a chem impact panel here in the us as possible it's about 25 biomarkers nothing crazy yet back then or nothing too extreme so um for example if i have a protein intake how does that correlate with all 25 biomarkers so if i've got then the next step in that is knowing how the biomarkers change during aging can all cause mortality risk because the reference range is not intended for longevity it's just a population-based average are you inside that 95 phase confidence interval are you too low or are you too high then they get you know medicine gets involved so knowing how each biomarker changes during aging do i want it to be high do i want it to be low uh i can push not push or i can follow the correlations for example high proteins associated with high glucose going in the wrong direction high proteins associated with lower homocysteine going in the right direction so when i and and using a statistical significance threshold just a standard p equals p less than 0.05 which is pretty standard in in academic studies how many are less than that threshold in terms of going in the right direction versus wrong and then having a net score so for example for each macro micro and foods i have a net score now and i try to literally follow all the correlations for the next test and then if the next test with the next test it's like a you know it's like a neural net where i'm recalculating after every test and after doing that for a long time i've been able to further reduce my quote-unquote biological age using uh levine's test which was pretty good for a while it was about 12 years younger than my chronological and then sometime about last year i figured out the recipe basically and in my data and was able to push that even further down to 16 17 years and consistently 16 to 17 years you know on a full seven year test average so it isn't following one correlation with diet and the biomarkers it's you know if i have 40 correlations you know am i following 38 of them 37 of them because it's very difficult to follow them all but i try to you know uh push my diet to follow the biomarkers now in working with people uh who are also trying to do this does he does this approach work in other people for the people that do the same thing that follow as many of their own correlations that are doing you know tracking their diet and tracking the blood test variables they also have been able to reduce their levine test age uh but for others that are about 50 50 you know maybe they follow half the correlations and the other half they're just not as diligent you know more stable not making further reductions so um that's where i am there and then uh in the last couple years i decided to expand from levine's test and even using aging.ai which are pretty easy to use free uh blood-based biomarker test going into the epigenetics uh dunedin pace horvath and then i've even expanded it there into telomere length metabolomics um or microbiome health all these things can be tracked and optimized so that we can you know minimize disease risk and potentially maximize longevity yeah like you know longevity is or you know we never know when we're gonna die like there's some genetic factors that determine that and um you know on unpredictable events or whatever as well but uh at least like you know the best thing you can do is to try to you know optimize your blood work because that is a reflection of your biological age like all the different markers reflect your biological age and um you know there's probably another single one maybe that some of them are better than others obviously but you have to like try to optimize all the biomarkers to give yourself the highest chance of living the longest if that makes sense 100 i was the first thought that came to my mind was brother from another mother because i i agree 100 100 now in terms of no one knows when we'll die you know the fact is something's going to kill us right potentially or we live long enough to live forever whether that's true or not but uh you know if you've optimized like you said everything we minimize that risk and then you know you improve your chances like if i get a bad infection if i've been working on optimizing lymphocytes and keeping inflammation generally low i should be able to respond relatively quickly versus someone who maybe they don't track their lymphocytes they're already starting off if they get a bad infection uh you know with low lymphocytes and infection drives it even further down further increasing the risk of death so for me i can't think of a better strategy to you know minimize disease risk minimize uh even the duration of a potential uh disease you know um well maybe infection wise uh and but then the drawback is i hear from people they'll say well where's the proof that this works there is no proof how would you prove it so um the proof is we'll have to see you know with people who are using this approach how long do we live right uh and then take the average of that relative to the average population so it's you know it's a and of one rct uh non-academic without having to you know rely on academia to take 50 years to figure it out or not so yeah but i mean you know the the there's no really other way to go about it so let's say as medicine becomes more advanced let's say mainstream medicine and doctors and uh what they will try to do as well is to just follow the similar pattern of like future medicine is going to be about optimizing all the biomarkers with different methods like diets exercise supplements different therapeutics and interventions like like that's going to be just the future we're just you know doing it in equals one right now and in the future like there's no other way to really extend human lifespan or at least like hellspan other than trying to optimize all the biomarkers one at a time and with different methodologies to do that so i agree i agree 100 there the only question is when in the future will it be 20 years will it be 40 years and just just a quick story on that so before before i went to grad school which sounds horribly you know pretentious but i'm not not trying to be nutrigenomics the quote-unquote neutrogenomics was a hot field 20 years ago uh so i thought yeah that sounds great i want to know what's the best diet to influence gene expression well here we are at 20 plus years later and get what's a diet based on your genes you know and i don't mean like four genes i mean the full human genome sequencing and based on your individual genome what's the bet nobody knows right so it's 20 years later and even in terms of quote-unquote precision precision nutrition that's even a slowly evolving field you know it started with like uh cgms and some research labs for example have done the white bread challenge where some people will have a glucose spike in response to eating white bread and others won't so then you can personalize who may be you know glucose responders or non-responders of certain foods but still that's one biomarker right what's the net effect systemically there is no net effect systemically approach it's still only optimizing glucose or only up so that gets to the question of when will it happen will it take 20 years 40 years it will be in the future for sure but i don't want to wait around you know for uh yeah yeah it's you know it's too late by that time if you just wait and you know with aging it is like you you're always you know the trend with aging is that everything goes down the decline the muscle mass muscle strength year to max uh sex hormones and all these things they decrease with age and if you're just doing nothing then you're kind of slippering down some people naturally will age slower because of genetics or their environment whereas others you know will have to put in more effort to do to achieve a slower speed of aging or to slow down the decline but you know if you're doing nothing then you're always going to be aging faster compared to actually doing all the kind fundamentals at least that we know are beneficial for slowing down kind of the decline yeah and i don't have longevity longevity genetics either i mean i saw your story and your family history you know the longest person in my family too is currently my dad at 80 but before him the longest lived man was 67 and that was kind of the upper limit anyone who got the 67 was dead uh so um yeah i mean i i've said this before but i don't know if you've seen the movie uh the martian with matt damon where you basically stuck on mars and he says he's got a science out of it to survive i kind of feel like that in terms of longevity you know uh i've got a science as much of this as i can using science as a verb uh it's you know i i don't want to sound like a immortal immortalist uh you know because that starts to venture off into fringe but i don't like the idea of death i don't want to ever want to die i legitimately want to live long enough to live forever and if i can't well uh you know i've said it before but i'll die trying right so um there's too much cool stuff to do you know there's too much cool stuff to do and i don't want to be dead so i can't do it so yeah and i mean like the quality of life itself will be higher anyway like if uh the average person starts to like take different medications and uh not to be able to be or not to be able to do things independently really to like you know host chores or even walking or eating then uh you know what kind of life is that so you know if you can extend the hill span which means that you stay you know more active and more freed you have more freedom to do what you want for longer even if you don't live longer it's kind of worth it to the quality of life that uh you experience 100 100 agree and that gets me into thinking about specific mechanisms that are you know deficient or down regulated during aging that can be targeted you know whether diet or supplements uh that yeah which gets back to the what's the best thing to target what's your actual data what's your actual deficiency or sub-optimal status and can you target that directly through diet supplements exercise you know all that so maybe we can cover some of like most fundamentals but uh with a like what's your research what what have you found with your research so like you know exercise diet and yeah like exercise and diet i probably like that you two biggest ones that people know argued for health and enjoyment so like what is what what have you found that is the biggest you know things that uh improve the speed of aging um and what what are like the most associated with reduced mortality yeah so there's a few answers in there because underlying diet and fitness is sleep because if my sleep is even within one hour of my average less uh cognitively and physically i i'm not at my best and i can be easily over trained if i'm even in a mild sleep debt so the essential is sleep optimizing that at least for me uh but then probably calorie restriction i mean i've heard you say it uh that plenty of you know gold standard research on that um in my data too um you know because i have i have calorie data lined up with the blood test biomarkers and um it's the lower my calorie intake the lower my average calorie intake for each blood test that's associated with the best benefit and actually i've reduced my dunedin pace from a high of 0.89 to 0.76 on the test in in may i have them waiting on july test results the only thing that's different over that time is that i've been slowly reducing my body fat levels um and the diet has been mostly the same so probably calorie restriction now for most people that's very difficult for me it is too in the past i've lost 20 pounds in six weeks and then binged it back on so over the past uh two to three years i've been just making very small cuts you know maybe 30 calories per day on average so you know for blood test one 2200 blood test 2 2170 average per day over a very long period of time and i found that that's uh you know i'm probably about 20 cr based on that when compared with where i was uh three years ago so um but that's what works for me if some people want to cut calories fast and that's what works for them have at it but i'm interested in very long-term changes i've changed my my exercise routine let me i want to ask a question about the color restrictions so like you know yeah like people usually say that so how do you like it like quantify or define it uh people find it difficult to like either know how many calories they need to eat or like because you know if you go by the premise that color restriction will slow down aging then you know eventually you'll eat nothing or zero color is like but where do you draw the line of okay this is the amount of calories that i'm going to eat and this is the amount of weight i'm going to lose so yeah like what's the like sweet spot for the weight loss how much weight do you need to lose and how many calories do like people need to eat for both kind of genders if you know yeah so i see two or three things going on there one is um for me my highest average calorie intake that corresponded to any blood test was about 2 800. So for now my average calorie intake is somewhere around 2100 so just doing that math it's somewhere around 20 to 25 cr now at 2800 calories per day i was more active purposely more active so i don't if even if you don't use that as my set point quote unquote 2800 2500 or so versus 20 100 that's uh you know it's still a cr now out you know just blatant cr for the point of doing cr there is some animal data that it may not work for all uh genetic backgrounds so with that in mind also following the blood biomarkers and other objective uh biomarkers of health and systemic function right so um you know as i mentioned for me when tracking calorie intake versus about 25 different biomarkers a lower calorie intake is associated with an overall more quote-unquote beneficial biomarker profile so um so that's two and then um three is okay if you keep eating lower and lower and lower eventually get to zero and then you're just you know frail and decrepit but that's exactly the thing you know there's going to be a lower level where you're at your leanest if you go lower you're losing muscle mass you're losing muscle strength fitness function mobility all of that stuff you don't want to be clearly below that but uh is that six percent body fat for meant for men for example i mean i can't say what it would be for women uh because now you've got you know uh you know not pregnancy but uh period you know you you lose your period if you go below uh certain you you know you stop stop ovulating right so i you don't want to clearly go go below that if you're a woman but um or maybe they do if they're not just interested in ovulating but um you know so there's i can't say what the optimal body fat would be just broadly it would probably vary between people but uh i'd say most people have room for improvement in terms of reducing their body fat down you get to you know um and i've been you know and i may there may become a point where i just literally get too lean and the biomarkers start to look worse but because i've been tracking the biomarkers for so long and they're generally very stable uh you know i i when i test it's very reproducible because i know the diet i standardize you know when the last workout is before each blood test i standardize the fasting period before each blood test what time the blood test is how much water i'm taking it's all many variables that can impact the blood test results if the blood tests are different it's more likely that that it's stuff that i've done in my approach rather than other external variables so my data is pretty consistent so if i see some wild change or even a slow moving change over a few tests i can track it back all right is it my calorie intake is too low or uh is it my i'm just too lean i'm losing a little bit of massive strength so um yeah objective markers to find that sweet spot so it's more like a j shaped curve that if you're too low body fat and eating too little calories then that may might increase your mortality because of like under nutrition and um like losing muscle mass and muscle strength and if you're kind of reducing your calories then to some sort of sweet spot then that's the lowest mortality but if you overeat calories and you gain weight then that also increases mortality because of the you know issues with obesity and weight gain so it's yeah like everyone kind of has to find obviously they're kind of sweet spot but but yeah i agree that many people you know you know the average person isn't really that lean or or if they do think that they're lean then they probably have at least a few pounds extra that they could lose uh to for like optimal health like whether or not it's worthwhile the effort for them obviously is everyone else to decide you know so it's you know it does require effort to eat less and then to be like slightly hungry and like you know i've been i've been doing different kinds of you know i've been doing like bodybuilding as well when i was young and and i always like try to maintain a lean body composition and yeah it does require like some deliberate effort to stay lean all the time and of course there are some methods to make it easier like timesheet eating or or you know even like different kinds of dietary practices that you can use to improve satiety for example but yeah like it's it's you know it's not easy to always stay lean but of course you know it's some methods are easier than others yeah i've had the same experience uh but for me a high volume diet so an abundance of uh you know vegetables and fruit uh my average fiber intake is 80 about 85 grams per day on you know 2100 calories so that's a very uh you know high volume so when i was eating lower volume very difficult to be uh satisfied and satiated um for the first time i can say or you know for at least the last few years uh eating a high volume approach works for me in terms of or helps me be more satiated where i'm not overeating that's probably the most toxic thing um that and it well in terms of health is just overeating and even just a few hundred calories above your maintenance you know doing that for a few weeks will start to mess up all kinds of biomarkers including uh heart rate variability wrestling heart rate um so but going back to that too i've um i changed my exercise routine completely too so i used to be just three hour workouts throwing heavy weights around i'm you know i've said this before but i'm like a gorilla mindset i just love lifting heavy stuff for a long time it makes me feel good but once i started tracking the fitness metrics um they were terrible they were weren't what you'd expect to see from someone you know walking 15 to 20 miles a week and doing two two workouts a week six hours of weight lifting i was over trained chronically over trained tired all the time um sleep quality was terrible so once i started tracking heart rate variability resting heart rate i started to figure out all right what's my optimal training amount in terms of uh you know duration of the workouts and i i it was an ego ego hit i had to cut down the amount of sets and reps and volume of training um and i you know i people push back at me and say well what's your vo2 max and i'll say that's a that's a fallacious argument because it's like saying you know i need to have a vo2 max of 70 or 65 an elite endurance athlete to live as long as possible but there's no evidence that that's true the vo2 max studies in terms of reduced all-cause mortality risk it's in the low 50s so even just a general fitness routine you'll be in at least the low 40s and i know that because i tested my vo to max three times from 2010 to 2015 and there was no i wasn't doing any hardcore cardio hit or like that so now is low 40s as good as low 50s it's still a reduced all-cause mortality or as compared to someone in the 20s or 30s that's sedentary now what if i'm maintaining the 40s for indefinitely versus someone who's probably gonna have a harder time maybe maintaining that elite 50 plus vo2 max you know so uh and i was saying it's a fallacious argument because do i need to have a squat one rm of 300 pounds or a 300 250 pound bench press to live as physically as long as i can i don't think so i think you know there's there's the risk of diminishing returns where the amount of training involved into getting there and i say this is you know in the past my 1rm for the bench was 255 at 155 pounds body weight but i can't physically train like that anymore it's just i'm over training so is the longevity benefit of being at the elite of physical fitness um is that is there a long is there an additive longevity benefit i don't think so where are the you know the elite endurance athletes or you know uh strength focused athletes that are 115 years old they don't exist so there's got to be some which is crazy there's got to be some uh you know exercise is clearly good for health span and increasing average survival increasing average lifespan but there's almost some something simultaneously bad about it where you don't get to the maximal or beyond you know when i started i mean a long-winded rant but when i started on this journey journey and i saw all the bodybuilders as a teenager and reading the magazines which nobody reads magazines anymore but back when i was a kid they're magazines i was like yeah i want to be fit and ripped and lean like that too and i thought how can they die they look fantastic they're they're functional and fit and strong and then i realize that's just you know i've seen your your videos on it too where uh more muscle mass is not better right so but then it begs the question of why we would that be true right so i i think most people are chronically over trained even most fitness-minded people are chronically over trained in the short term and when i say short term i mean in terms of average longevity that's okay but that chronic over training is clearly not good for the maximum and titrating the exercise dose even in terms of how much muscle mass to carry i think that's an important part of the maximum longevity uh equation whether that's true we'll see so yeah yeah it's like you know the amount like i said the amount of time it requires to reach this elite especially vo2 max it's i don't know specific numbers but especially the older you get then it's going to be very hard to maintain the 70 vo2 max and even even then like the 70 may not may not be better because the the lowest reduction is already in the 50s but like you said that uh yeah like you know the elite that is they obviously have to sacrifice part of their health and over train too much to reach the elite level uh like i think there's very few cases maybe like very individual cases where like some genetically very blessed people who are able to get to the elite level with much less training um then they might might get away with it but the average person probably you know for them to get to the elite level they have to sacrifice their health in in in some amounts and again like the kind of moderate amounts of exercises still the best you you obviously still want to strive for getting like above average with uh the uh be automatics and muscle strength and muscle mass perhaps but like you know elite levels are probably like too much yeah 100 agree but then it just raises the question of how much uh individualized exercise is optimal right uh and that's very debatable you'd have to study it study yourself too just like the biomarkers in the diet over a long period of time using objective metrics uh so for me for example i you know i'm on basically like a four day cycle at the most day one workout day four workout light very light stuff in between if if i go beyond that if i start to work out the next workout on the fifth day or beyond it's harder to maintain strength over time and i don't want to see any strength decrement well that's just one aspect of the approach clearly but just using that as an example so if i start to have once every five days strength starts to go down um so it you know but other people may be able to do you know every day and not like you said have a genetic background where they can tolerate tolerate it physiologically and make strength gains and keep strength gains over i can't physically do that so um i wish that were true i have a guerrilla mindset to do that but unfortunately my body doesn't agree and whether that was true in the past i don't know i didn't track these things you know at your in the 20s like you wish i did uh so what what do we what do you look out for then like if uh you're pushing it too much like what metrics or so so i track heart rate variability and resting heart rate and uh when i'm quote unquote over trained the resting heart rate goes up the heart rate variability goes down when it's fully recovered heart rate variability is high resting heart rate is low so i basically give myself enough time before the next workout for them to more fully recover so for example before the last workout just throwing out numbers heart rate variability resting heart rate it was like 70 42. So for the next three days my heart rate variability was lower 62 heart resting heart rate was higher 42 43.44 which suggested that i'm not ready for the next workout but then when i woke up yesterday that was actually up to 77.42 so now the data now the data suggests that at least my cardiovascular system but those cardiovascular system metrics are have inputs from the sympathetic and sympathetic nervous system and also adrenal function so it's like the integration of three different systems but since my data was quote unquote back to its peak that suggests i'm ready for a workout so i you know quote unquote hit it hard or i did my usual workout yesterday now sometimes i'm more fully recovered on day three so it's a three day cycle sometimes work stress gets in the way you know uh or other life stress gets in the way i've got to push it to a five-day cycle or when i was battling covid my daughter had coveted in may just to take it easy and not over stress uh my system to give myself the best ability to recover as quick as possible i actually pushed that into seven days just not trying to over tax the system so knowing what overtrain looks like using heart rate variability and resting heart rate as objective metrics and then following that to a t that's what's worked for me i've done that for five years now and those data are supposed to get worse with age heart rate variability goes down with age uh resting heart rate peaks at about 50 and then goes down but uh i've actually you know in some ways like brian johnson and actually better because he and i have corresponded and actually recommend it to him that you're over training because i shouldn't have better data than him he's younger than me i've actually you know not to boast but but uh i've pushed my heart rate variability back towards more youthful levels and uh heart rate uh push resting heart rate down lower which is the way it should be high heart rate variability low resting heart rate so yeah hiv is also very very useful and like you know you can even use things like even just you know how you feel in terms of balance like if you have you know struggling maintaining balance with your one leg then that can be a sign of like nervous system being over fried or if you're like grip strength is weak like if you just have less strength and then you usually do and you're trying to like push through it then you know yeah like you're gonna get the workout in but you might not you know adapt to a higher level so like if you're still weaker than the last time then you probably are still under recovering or you have like some other you know hole in your boat so to say that is kind of sinking it so you can just in tune into it like everyone will develop some intuition about you know whether or not they are recovered or if they're over training but uh yeah like if you get sick for example then that can be a sign that's that you're like doing too much for me the intuitive is tricky though because the the mindset involved in regular training you know and especially if you're doing uh strength training uh you know you can't be and i you can't be weak mentally to strength train because you're challenging yourself mentally right right so for me the intuitive stuff is a very uh tricky slippery slope because there may be days i wake up and i say i don't want to do it and then am i am i doing that because i'm legitimately not fully recovered yet am i doing that because i'm being lazy when i have the objective for me for other people may be different but for me when i have the objective metrics there's no excuse if i see my most fully recovered uh heart rate variability resting heart rate uh and that's helped tremendously too in terms of uh you know the intuition right so i don't have to think about it now i see the data it's let's go the data doesn't look great it's like all right i can push it another day this is clearly not fully recovered uh you know but then even on a day when the the cv metrics or cardiovascular metrics aren't as at my best are there days when i have to push through it in order to stick to a certain you know work schedule for example i do that it's not ideal but um yeah i hear you about the intuition i prefer the more you know quantifiable way but i can i can see it may work for some yeah so what kind of like workouts do you do like what is what do you think is the most important kind of exercise to do for the london yeah well comp so there's a few things compound move i stick to the compound movements uh you know uh multi uh joint movements so pull-ups push-ups i don't have i do it in my apartment you know i it's time efficient and eventually i'll have a bigger place i'll have more equipment but uh pull-ups push-ups deadlifts overhead press um uh rows uh lunges i stay away from squats because i've i've had herniated discs in the past from uh eagle lifting and two heavy squats so i've got to be very careful with uh how much i'm doing in terms of loading my spine and then a whole bunch of mobility callus calisthenics flexibility i do some like uh it's not all in the uh i guess the sagittal plane where it's all just you know uh rigid i do you know kind of some taekwondo taekwondo-ish kicks spin kicks and you know which is great for core for the core and uh but it's it's a mix of strength training it's like a long cardio circuit of 80 minutes continuously moving um covering all the bases mobility balance flexibility and then much like my diet it's it's quantified so you know i hear i hear in the fitness space a lot like you know change it up or if it gets stale change it up that doesn't work for me like i'm a quantified type person where i do an exact amount of sets and reps now granted i'm trying to improve those sets and reps over time but i have benchmarks for each set that i do for example overhead press my first set is 70 pounds 12 reps which may not seem like much but i'm 145 pounds 66 kilos that's not bad for my uh second set i'm looking at 90 pounds four reps so that's the benchmark if it's below that and especially over time i'm losing strength i don't want to do that so uh i i'm trying to hit at least those benchmarks just using that as an example for pull-ups i've been posting pull-up videos on my youtube channel uh for four years i was you know 12 pull-ups full extension full flexion not this half you know you come you come halfway none of that it's full extension full collection so i know the 12 is my benchmark i don't want to go below that uh so the goal is to at least hit the benchmarks each workout and then with the goal clearly of making small but incremental gains over time at best at worst maintaining that and so far so good even with the leanness you know going from about 12 body fat downtown somewhere probably in the nine or eight percent range i measured it by dexa last december it was about 12 i'm seven or six or seven pounds leaner since then i haven't lost any strength which makes me think probably most of it is muscle mass maybe i've lost some lean mass who knows it's something hydrated in my body that i probably lost no loss of strength at all for those major compound movements so um yeah i try to hit the benchmarks with the goal of longevity though is obviously keeping that as you know uh keep minimizing any decline that i can for as long as possible that's the goal yeah and it seems like you're focusing mostly on like strength rather than mess which we uh covered as well that you know muscle mass ease associated with reduced mortality but when you look at it then strength is significantly more compared to the muscle mass and muscle mass is also the issue like yeah if you are becoming too bulky for example or if you if you just have a lot of muscle mass but you also have very high body fat percentage and then you know that that actually speeds up the aging because you're just you know eating too many calories and the excess body fat is also not good so yeah like you want to maintain this leaner physique that is strong uh relative to its body weight so you're like you know you have muscle but you're not too high body fat percentage and you're also strong at the same time so that's kind of the main goal when it comes to like resistance training yep 100 agree yeah for me whatever mass results as a result of the strength uh training portion of the workout whatever mass results as a part of that that's the goal now maybe that's not the best approach because i was about 30 pounds heavier at one point and i was exactly the type you're talking about more muscle but also the most more fat still relatively lean probably at most 15 percent but the consequence there and i you know it so long story short is get lean stay lean don't not get lean get big lean and then get small lead because the consequence there is so i've got skin here you know and i've got skin on my bicep that now looks like uh it like an 80 year old and it's it basically it's basically like a like a like a like a skin mask you know it's just floppy because i used to be bigger right and now it's stretched out so uh yeah the goal is still to have as much muscle as i can within the smaller frame uh as possible but the drawback is you know i've got a little bit of loose skin in in if i could go back if i knew better i would i would have uh get lean staley and not get big then get you know smaller lean so yeah how would you like if you are let's say in your 50s or something and you're just starting to take care of your health and uh you are like let's say this kind of standard skinny fat or this with a dead body or something that you don't have that much muscle you're not that strong but you have body fat so what would you say like how would that kind of a person start like what should be their main focus should they like try to first lose the body fat try to first get strong try to first build muscle or what's their kind of operation yeah i think the first approach is uh stick find something that you can stick to for a long time if your goal is longevity so whatever that looks like in terms of fitness even if it's just regular walking if they don't want to strength train but whatever that regular physical activity is something that they could stick to for a long time the same with the diet you know it doesn't have to be the extreme of what i'm doing you know uh basically one percent cheat in terms of calories uh is junk you know it doesn't have to be where where that is for me but wherever wherever their current approach is where can they make improvements that they can maintain for a long period of time i think for the regular average person i think that's the first place to start and then if they you know just even after doing that from some amount of time if they want to get deeper and get more specialized and get more focused then you start to take the next step all right does that mean more of this exercise or more vegetables or less of something you know so i think taking it very slow with habits you can maintain for a long time i think that's uh the focus um yeah and you know chances are if they've if you don't have a lot of background in training then just doing something will will already put them on the right track so if you're like skinny fat you don't have a long training history then just doing yeah like regular calisthenics or doing some push-ups and pull-ups will already make you lose fat build muscle and strength at the same time so it's like you know yeah but it's got to be as you know consistent right it's uh the mindset of consistency where it can't be out once every two weeks you know hey i did a workout now it's two weeks later like what do you really you know are you making any gains based off that or are you really impacting anything so uh trying to figure out what's a consistent approach you know is it one workout two workouts four workouts per week um yeah yeah and you know the consistency here like is the best most important thing for london because if you are even if you're like elite athlete or uh you're in high school you're a super fit or something but now you don't do anything then it's like it doesn't matter that you wear super fit like what matters is what you're doing it continuously yeah that's probably the hardest part whether it's diet even sleep you know like uh i make sure try to make sure i go to sleep at the same time every night uh without fail i mean sometimes it's just not that easy you know and that can throw the whole system off for a couple of days or if i'm gonna travel to europe you know now i've got for four or five days i've got the time change you know so uh and that's the you know or travel anywhere not just europe but uh yeah it's not always easier said than done but yeah consistency is definitely another skill to add to the diet exercise sleep approach consistency right is another layer so yeah absolutely so what what about the diet or or maybe like we can also briefly cover the cardio like so we talked about vo2 max so like how do you do trained cardio for realtymax or so i don't specifically target vo2 max yet but uh like i said it's been in the low 40s the three times that i did measure i haven't changed my system much since then so i'm probably in that same range uh maybe even a little better because you know how many liters of oxygen that you could consume is proportional to lean mess or even body weight vo2 divided by body weight so since my body weight is 15 pounds lighter than where i was when i had my vo2 max measure technically my vo2 max may go up even though my absolute amount of oxygen consumption or maximum oxygen consumption hasn't changed um so uh ah so vo2 max right so basically i do low intensity walking in between the workouts now because my workouts are you know 80 minutes and it's uh i'm not sitting around like i don't do a set and then sit five minutes and then do another set there's none of that it's continuous moving and even with that approach the circuit-based approach even though my focus is optimizing strength maximizing strength uh by doing a circuit type workout i may be limiting my maximal strength gains but i'm getting the cardiovascular stimulus of continuously moving so um but that's set now another reason i don't go specifically into training cardio aside from the low intensity stuff after that 80 minute workout is uh it can impair the uh performance of my 80 minute workouts which to me are like the core of what i do everything revolves around now i don't want to mess that up at all uh so if so in in during weeks where i'm on quote-unquote vacation where i don't have to follow an in-person work schedule i can either work from home or just you know choose my day as i want to so i'm not exerting energy on things that don't do anything to improve my health like just going to the office and interacting all day it's a stressor like a moderately intense workout like imagine if i didn't have that and then i could apply that energy to to a few minutes of hit on that day and i'd get the the physically you know the physical function improvement without you know you know with the natural exercise stimulus whereas the work stress there's no functional improvement it's just stress right so for now that's one reason i'm not able to add more into the approach but eventually with more freedom i'll be able to add a little bit more hit into the workout but even that's a little tricky too because the amount of hit that i'll do after that 80 minute workout knowing that i'm already a little bit over trained on the day after the workout if i go above a certain amount of hit in terms of duration that'll delay recovery and now i'm not on a three or four day 80 minute workout cycle now i'm on the five day now i'm so even though the hit may be improving my vo2 max now i'm affecting my strength and performance so there is a fine line between how much of it i can i can include above just the basic walking in between but the good news is when considering my cardiovascular fitness metrics being relatively youthful it shows that you don't have to kill yourself with extra cardio outside of these 80 minute workouts um so which is good news for people who don't want to exercise themselves to death right so um you can get maximal benefit for i guess minimal you know even though still two 80 minute workouts a week is still a pretty decent amount of vigorous exercise so yeah you need you at least for you you know where you're at and you know whether or not you need to do more or less and uh yeah like we said like the 4 40 to 50 is kind of the the one that is low associated with the lowest mortality risk but there are but there are you know i i would like to do a little bit of isolation work you know so i can fill out the meat sacks that have developed on my uh you know around my elbows right i just i can't i physically can't yet uh just in terms of time commitment but uh yeah yeah of course what about the diet then like you know there's a lot of debate about like what's the best diet for longevity let's talk about what what's worked for you right now and yeah what do you think about what are some of the like main principles that is most important when it comes to diet yeah so i'm not a dietary absolutist i'm not a vegan i'm not a carnivore i'm not even a you know flexitarian or whatever you would call it i'm a data driven guy let's see what the biomarkers look like and then let the dot i'm diagnostic i want the diet to give me the best biomarker profile covering as many of the organ systems as possible so with vigorous experimentation since 2015 what that looks like for me is about 18 protein uh about 40 net carbs and about 40ish 42 percent fat total fat now included in that total fat is fiber because fiber is converted by cut bacteria into short chain fatty acids so technically the fiber fermentation products you can add uh to uh fat so it's it's a basically a 40 40 20. Now i haven't settled on those just arbitrarily i'm not trying to follow a zone diet or whatever that diet closely approximates that's what the data has driven me towards um it's uh i eat fish every day i eat dairy every day in terms of a small amount of low-fat yogurt not full fat because for whatever reason in my data full fat yogurt sends more biomarkers in the wrong direction than right and while full fat yogurt tastes delicious is it's like ice cream every day it just doesn't work for my biomarkers so i rarely eat beef and eggs and chicken i'm not adverse to eating them i would they just don't give me the uh they're not correlated with the again best biomarker results relative to something like sardines which i eat every day and i'm probably going to increase them to test the specific hypothesis um i eat sardines every day uh one or two tins depending on the day because that's got a net positive correlative score with the multitude of blood biomarkers so um in terms of diet absolutism i've seen pretty good and what i mean by pretty good is relatively youthful biomarker data for people who are close to uh carnivore-ish paul saladino doesn't have terrible biomarkers for many of them some of them can be improved and they look aged dha sulfate for example uh which he rationalizes is within the reference range but it's not youthful and mine is in that same boat right now so that's what i'm trying to actively work on uh but on the other side i've seen vegans with um relatively youthful biomarker data and again using the metric of not just the reference range but where should they be for aging or or where should they be for youth and reduced all-cause mortality risk so it's it depends on the person and um you know figuring that out for each person whether it's high fat or lower fat uh that too depends on the person and for people that i work with i don't i don't go into it with a specific art this is where we need to go it's all right let's see what your data shows after a few tests and follow that you know so yeah yeah like you know of course there's it comes down to like what the person believes is optimal and whether or not they believe cholesterol for example is harmful or not or or that i would increase the risk and of course it might not increase the risk for some people uh and it does for the other people so you know genetics plays a huge role and you know you're just you know again like you need to kind of follow the data in a lot of ways and tried to uh get to the you know the ref the results with your blood work that would fit as closely as possible with the lowest mortality risk that's what that's what i think like you don't know what your genetics really are and you don't know whether or not the uh or you know you can do the genetic test etc but you don't really know how it's going to express in the end result like if you do have like some bad genes for let's say saturated fat or or sugar for example then you don't really know like how it's going to express in the end so what you can only do is to try to still achieve the most optimal biomarkers based on the reference ranges and based on the like yeah the the studies that show that what what biomarkers and what numbers are found to be with the lowest mortality risk 100 agree and that i i couldn't agree more in terms of uh genetic risk is what can happen but the objective biomarkers are actually telling you what's happening or what has happened so that's actually one reason why and again i'm not trying to sound pretentious but one reason why i went uh into studying basically metabolomics rather than genetics as a postdoc because metabolomics is basically telling you this is the cellular readout of everything that actually happened or has happened versus the script this is your genome this is what can happen uh now if there may be stuff that you look at the biomarkers the circulating biomarkers and there may be stuff that's resistant to change and then okay you can go back for curiosity even uh and and you know is this because i have a folate snip that affects methylation status okay all right so but even without that information um you'd still have to optimize you know homocysteine or whatever methylation status uh biomarker use epigenetics um you'd still have to make some changes based on diet supplements exercise whatever it may be it's almost like the genetics is a curiosity all right i may have this but yeah you need the end result in addition to the gen you can't just do genetics you have to have those circulating biomarkers uh but yeah unfortunately most people aren't thinking about that yet or you know so yeah you know it's kind of like i wish like everyone would just do some of the main biomarkers on whatever diet they're following and to see if it's something that is actually or if they are healthy and if they have the you know good biomarkers because you know other if you don't if you haven't done the blood work and you're just following a particular diet thinking that it's the best diet you know whether that be a vegan or a carnivor diet but your blood work is really bad based on what we know is good or bad then uh it's like you're just taking a gamble it's like just a very risky gamble and uh you're kind of like deceiving yourself in some ways and uh you know especially you're just following someone else's like narrative if you're following some person's diet if that makes sense yep 100 agree and the same idea can be applied to supplements right so just using rapamycin as an example i i know of a lot of people who are taking it and when i push them and say do you actually have blood biomarker data uh you know sometimes people actually come to me too and they'll say i wonder what your blood test would look like if you added x y or z and the first thing i say is which of my biomarkers do you expect to improve as a result of that and so i think people uh should be thinking in that mindset like if you're taking rapamycin or some other you know purported uh zero protector or cenolytic do you see a net improvement in your biomarkers have you even looked at it right but that can be cost prohibit prohibitive for many people whereas just taking rapamycin and a few dollars a month based on hope but again like you said you want it to be a net positive and the only way to know is to test right so um you know it's kind of like the uh cell phone right uh or you know 100 years ago nobody had a phone even just you know with the wire and then it took 100 years with demand and technology and then everybody's got a phone in their pocket right so eventually the blood testing stuff will become so easily available whether it's at home or just even going to the clinic or they send a phlebotomist to your house then prices will come down it'll become more affordable more people will want to do it uh and then you know people can see or not if a given intervention is working so um i try my best to use a targeted approach you know i have a specific deficiency and where my diet currently is now is there isn't much wiggle room because it optimizes the net effect of biomarkers so i i don't want to blow up the system just to improve one or two things um you know i want to make small tweaks and if the small tweaks don't work then you know uh go to supplements so that's i i evolved with no supplements into just a few and with targeted specific hypotheses has it worked in a published study that's a good start uh do i have a mechanistic hypothesis on my own uh that it could impact it which maybe nobody's published i do stuff like that too like uh searing plus vitamin b6 which nobody was talking about and i'm still doing that experiment on homocysteine so for me it's a more targeted approach whereas i know people like brian are taking 100 supplements and uh you know it's just insanity like what what happens when you actually may need those supplements at a later date and you've already built up that endogenous tolerance and now what are you gonna do right how are you going to fix a problem if you can't use what's already been what literally what are you going to do right so i prefer to use it at the last when you actually need it and have a demonstrated need rather than just build on everything and who knows right yeah like yeah that could be dude like we didn't know that if you build some tolerance to supplements uh maybe like what you need to wash out maybe like for a few months or something but yeah yeah i don't think anyone has tested that idea yeah but uh do you think like there are there like any main like key principles for the diet so like you know are there certain foods that there are absolute no-no or uh yeah like how do you do that so i think the biggest thing is calorie intake now that said uh the components of it in terms of macros and micros also very important but if even if my calories are above the you know where i'm getting a little bit leaner i i find that that's the most you know potentially toxic for the biomarkers for heart rate variability resting heart rate so but even within that context you know knowing that if my protein is protein intake is too high the biomarkers going the wrong direction if my total fat intake is too high biomarkers go in the wrong direction but even a fat isn't a you know a monolith it's it's you know omega-3 omega-6 mono and polyunsaturated saturated right so what's interesting for me is saturated and monounsaturated more biomarkers in the wrong direction than right whereas omega-3 and omega-6 uh both of those have positive correlative scores with the biomarkers so um and that took me a while to figure out so i can't say that there's one big thing outside of total calorie intake but i do see additional uh value to more specific details for example two niacin uh you know many things have an rda which the basics would be to follow the rda you you know the minimum to prevent disease but what's the maximum to also impact health and longevity there's no there are no published studies on that so um many things micronutrient wise i'm way above the rda niacin two and a half times vitamin k which the rda is 100 micrograms i'm currently around 2200 but not not by some predetermined you know i'm going to go higher it's you know what are the blood biomarker correlations show if they have overall net correlations i push lower uh versus my average the correlations have a positive score i go higher than my average and sometimes i'll continually try to push the ones that are positive higher and even higher to see how high can i go uh and conversely you know the one ones that are negatives i go even lower to see how low can i go so i prefer greater specificity you know um uh so i for if it was one thing total calorie intake but you know macros micros even foods how many cheat meals can negatively impact the whole system right for me it's like one or two days of it and if i go more than that now i'm i'm obsessing about food uh i'll increase the risk of an overeat or a binge and that can wreck the system for you know until the next blood test so even discovering how often can i eat quote unquote junk which if i don't eat junk at all that too knowing that sets me up for a potential overeating or a binge so um yeah calories but there are many layers to it at least for me yeah yeah absolutely like you know there's different diets that you know and you know like the calories matter for the body composition and the biomarkers a lot like like i think like them a lot of them most of the biomarkers will improve if you just restrict some calories and lose some weight like with the exception of like maybe like lipids and cholesterol i think are the ones that are mostly regulated by the fat intake even if you're on a low calorie diet and you're losing weight your cholesterol could be still like high or um you know not in the range if you're eating like like either too much saturated fats or trans fats or whatever it is but yeah like even but but the other ones like your crp and blood sugar and a lot of things those things are generally moved in a better direction with some color restriction and losing some weight yeah the the question too is if your crp is one you know so the reference range says less than one and most people will be comfortable with point eight oh less than the reference range but uh just knowing like i've been saying knowing that less as low as possible for crp there's meta-analysis data lowest risk is basically as close to zero as you can get and i have videos on my channel about that so um you know it i just prefer the greater specificity and you know what's how can i get to that optimum level for as many biomarkers as possible just just a note too not just fat for cholesterol levels uh probably the most underrated nutrient for keeping your cholesterol levels relatively low is fiber including soluble fiber uh there are rcts using uh not many one of them in particular uh used up to 150 grams per day for two weeks and reduced total cholesterol by 30 in just two weeks so and most people are probably fiber deficient there at most if they're lucky eating 20 grams per day and a quote unquote high fiber diet would be 30 grams per day but this is probably still low right so um cholesterol is an easy one uh mike but cholesterol is an easy one but you know it's probably the most debated you know and argumentative uh one because you know the all-cause mortality data shows 2 220 to 229 is lowest risk for all cause mortality and very large epidemiological studies the one i have in mind is like 12 million people but and then if you go below 170 at almost every age group i think outside of like 35 year olds increased all-cause mortality risk so what's interesting about that is uh so then you've got the 80 year olds who also relatively higher cholesterol associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk relative to older people who have lower cholesterol right so that would make the argument that lower than about 170 is even at relatively young ages and old ages is bad for health right so um but my total cholesterol levels have been less than 160 for probably 15 20 years so am i putting myself at an increased risk so uh anyway just what's interesting about that is most people don't know that ldl and total cholesterol levels follow an inverted you during aging so it's low in youth it peaks at midlife and then declines during aging so at advanced stages it makes sense that the 50 year olds who have higher cholesterol levels probably have better health than an 80 year old with low cholesterol levels right so there's some sort of age like the body or the age rated decline that that causes the cholesterol levels to drop lower which is which is caused by aging simply a kind of yeah caused by aging or poor health uh yeah that for sure but then how would you know if you're relatively young and you also have relatively low cholesterol levels are you putting yourself at an increased risk based on the all-cause mortality data so um so there you know if knowing that ldl and total cholesterol is a part of the youthful phenotype in 20 year olds it's 170 milligrams per deciliter but that's in the context of high albumin low glucose high lymphocytes high hdl low inflammation so if your total cholesterol is also within that context at any age i'd say you're probably okay but there's no published data that has looked at it like that the the total cholesterol all-cause mortality studies will adjust for like you know glucose or triglycerides but they won't adjust for many other biomarkers that are found in youth so you don't get that story so that's almost an extrapolation where i'm kind of hoping that that's the case but i can't see how i'd be wrong where you know how someone who's 20 years old with a total cholesterol of 170 how are they going to have an increased mortality risk yeah if they're generally healthy and don't have a pre-existing disease right i find that hard to believe right there's got to be other factors involved yeah i mean i mean like the risk of heart disease is the lowest in your 20s as well um you know maybe not then maybe if you're in your teens maybe it's nowhere but you know you're low you're you're already at the lowest risk of heart disease in your 20s compared to like 80s and you know there's probably something else to the story so i don't think that the low cholesterol itself is harmful or something that is just there like with aging the reason why the people who die and they have a lower cholesterol level than it has their cholesterol levels are low because their body is unhealthy and they're already like kind of close to death if that makes sense yeah but it's just that disparity of you've got someone that's 50 years old their total cholesterol is 220 to 2 29 or 222 30 optimal based on all cause mortality do you want them to be at 170 or do you want to follow the data right so right could you get them to 170 and then make sure everything else looks youthful within that context i'm okay with it but if now you've reduced it to 170 and you know generally through exogenous means whether statins or other lipid lowering drugs so now it's at 170 but other biomarkers are aged that probably isn't going to be a good mix right so there there's also nuance to it in that in that area um yeah i guess yeah like all the biomarkers work in conjunction with each other as well in some ways that you know as when you're young then you're cholesterol levels might be somewhat lower than in your 50s but all the other markers are also much more optimal like the higher albumin or lower glucose or lower hemoglobin agency and so yeah like you need to just look at all the things and try to get all your biomarkers lower than your chronological age is is kind of the main message i guess 100 agree for some things though easier said than done you know yeah of course i don't know if you're tracking i don't know if you're tracking dhea sulfate just uh at most people track testosterone but testosterone is derived from dhea so it's and dhea dhea is actually the most circulating abundant steroid so i see more value in tracking that as a precursor too uh my levels were useful 300 you know in youth uh 15 well i don't know you've but 15 years ago and now it's like 120 ish which is aged and i've done 21 tests looking at correlations and trying to push that higher with no luck so i don't know if you're tracking it but if that's one uh because androgen levels decline during aging so and now i'm trying to work my ass off to try to reverse that trend without taking you know trt you know which i that's uh yeah have you really fixed the problem if you're just taking you know some band-aid of of uh of uh you know so i'm gonna fix the problem what's the root cause so right yeah but i mean if you do it naturally then the natural is the decline is inevitable you can just slow it down to a certain point because if you know the recipe if you know the correlations if you know the broad spectrum i don't think that the client so i just to push back on that there are biomarkers that are quote unquote resistant to dietary change uh an intervention like lipoprotein a that's the narrative that i've heard for years and i believe that too i've seen i've been able to cut that in half at its peak by making dietary change and following the correlations so i think everything is malleable it's just a matter of do you again just do you have enough time right because right if it takes you 20 years to opt to figure out the recipe to figure how to optimize it you know maybe that's too late you don't live long enough to figure out how to optimize your biomarkers so some of these things are a race against time so yeah so do you think like it's possible to have the dhes of a 20 year old or 30 30 year old in your 70s or 80s or yes and and if uh rather than saying i think it's true knowing that my data has been in the 120s for the past 20 or so tests if and when i do actually push that in the right direction even if i get it to 180 200 knowing that i've had it so low for so many tests if and or when i get it there uh it'll be proof of concept you know so and i've got some hypotheses that i'm kicking around in my head and i should say i i kind of have inside insider info into this uh because uh i don't want to sound pretentious again but in my day job as a scientist i'm currently studying metabolomic data and our data set is centenarians up to 115 years old and their offspring in spouses so androgens do decline during aging um but the long story short is there's i don't know if you're familiar with tryptophan and conjuring that ratio so anyway that that ratio declines during aging that's uh basically a marker of inflammation and low nad without getting too specific i see a road where potentially increasing fish oil intake can increase dhea sulfate based on correlations in that study and we'll probably publish that data sometime either later this year or early next year but these are just associations i'd have to test it by actually doing the experiment and that's knowing that my fish intake is already i'm eating it every day but it may not be enough uh so i think it is possible to increase dhea sulfate um i don't know stay tuned right gotcha yeah what what are some of like let's say like a few key obviously many people don't have the means or curiosity to do like a full blood panel or something like that but what are some of the most like simplest and like most important ones people like everyone should kind of know like a handful of them yeah uh it all goes back to quality sleep because as i mentioned if your sleep is sub-optimal you probably won't won't be your best physically mentally and if you're not at your best physically and mentally uh you're not going to make long-term progress you know or you'd be less likely and there's even data too that sub-optimal sleep quality can affect overeating or the uh the urge to eat less nutritious foods the day after or days after so i think it all starts with sleep and optimizing that um that now what does that look like in terms of is your eating window three hours before bed is it six hours is it like brian who's i think he stops at 11 i've found that cutting the eating window by about one ish with very little food at about three so eating the majority of it as close to earlier in the day as possible has dramatically improved my sleep quality and quantity but that's for me for some people maybe they stop that eating window a few hours or four hours whatever it is whatever it is before bed so optimizing sleep but then again calorie intake um not overeating staying lean uh these are all parts of the and you know that's probably the common denominator between you me and brian even though your dunedin pace is outstanding i mean it's as good as you can possibly get and i bet you could even go a little bit lower than 0.62 and maintain it low you know not not so i'm planning on getting to where you are it's just a matter of time because i don't you're probably i don't know six six-ish percent body fat what's your you know yeah well the lowest i i haven't i haven't messaged the dixon scan but uh we've already guessed then the lowest i usually would be would be like maybe seven or eight i think or or i might be lower i just like i lose a lot of fat on all the other parts of my body so my back and my you know arms and everything are very lean but my abs are kind of the last part where they don't go so i still have like maybe seven to eight percent i think but uh on average i might be like nine nine percent so i i think that's a common denominator with the very low dunedin pace is leanness right maybe maybe muscle mass having a good amount of muscle see i don't know you'd have to to do that experiment you'd have to have people who are eight to nine percent body fat but then within a range of how much muscle mass but uh because we're all relatively lean you know so and you know yeah so leanness is a huge part of the approach and it's supported that uh dunedin pace in terms of its comparison against the other gold standard epigenetic clocks horvath hanum grimage uh phenowage in the calorie study which was a two-year uh calorie restriction trial in people that they ended up achieving about 11 cow restriction for two years dunedin pace one of the reasons why it's so uh important is that was the only uh test of those epigenetic tests to show it uh an epigenetic age reduction or slowing over those two two years whereas the other five tests didn't show any epigenetic age change over two years which uh they predicted you'd see an improvement in biological age just just using blood-based biomarkers so people on cr are getting leaner over two years they're not gaining fat so that may be in terms of quote-unquote biohacking don't need a pace that may be the golden ticket there uh you know the leaner you are the better data you'll have so yeah i think so too yeah yeah sleep calories leanness regular consistent exercise uh but then you know like i said that for me that's not specific enough i want you know how can i what's the recipe for titrating as many of these organ system biomarkers as possible to really slow it down and then even taking it a step further you know the telomere shortening and you know metabolites that are in blood and nad optimizing nad um you know so i'm really covering as many bases as possible not just you know cells and proteins but getting close to the molecular you know level telomere length and nad uh you know as possible yeah right but like if a person goes to the lab so like they they want to know like what what are some of the not for the biological speed of aging or current or the justice yeah like just they don't want to know the biological age but to go to the doctor and okay what are they like five or six or eight kind of markers like glucose or ldl or crp or something that is like the biggest bang for the buck to for them to know like how are they doing in terms of their health yeah so uh i always uh suggest the standard can panel and uh complete blood count which is a relatively cheap blood test it's like 35 usd um so that covers multiple organ systems and the basics right it covers uh kidney liver immune now in the u.s crp is an additional test so with those two which is about 80 usd you can use things like morgan levine's dr morgan levine's final age which includes nine of those biomarkers and you can get a it's a pretty good test because because just using four baths epigenetic test is a gold standard because it's chronological age correlation is like 0.94 to 96 with a score of one being as perfectly linear as you can get so it's very close levine's phenowage was also in that same ballpark so in terms of predicting uh chronological age levine's test for 35 dollars basically well eighty dollars with crp is as close to as good as it can get for predicting chronological age and it's been shown to be associated with all cause mortality risk so for people who don't want to get too extensive with the metabolomics and oral microbiome all all the other things that i'm doing right now just the standard ken panel plus uh um cbc would be a good place to start but then also just using the cbc that 35 blood test aging.ai is also free it includes 19 biomarkers so i use that regularly um so it's relatively cheap now it's correlation with chronological age isn't as good as levine's test but as a part of that it's because levine's test includes age in her model whereas aging.ai doesn't have age in the model so if obviously if you have age in the model it's gonna it's correlation with chronological age it's going to be easier so for aging.ei it's just 19 biomarkers there's no age in the model so the core overall correlation is a little bit weaker than levine's test but um you still get a pretty good output in terms of tracking uh quote-unquote biological age outside of the more expensive you know horvath and and dunedin pace and i've been tracking both of those too for a few years trying to keep you know my cortical biological ages there as low as possible and i've had pretty good success aging.ai have been around 30 years now for uh seven or eight years average level so basically keeping it flat not not getting older with age and uh yeah similarly for levine's test i've it was like i said it was 12 years younger now i'm down to consistently 16 years younger and the goal is to keep that you know at least 16 years younger for as long as physically possible gotcha right so even outside of that too just a just to beat that to death a little bit more i try not to focus too heavily on those tests you know because some people you know will say you know oh that's your biological age score it's the cutesy measure and then i'll respond with yeah but look at the published studies on correlations and all cause mortality risk you know so publishing it's got some but there are no rcts where if you reduce your your biological age using these tests you've now extended lifespan by x right so the other way i look at this too is for each of these organ system specific biomarkers whether it's creatinine for kidney function you know bun uric acid just using kidney function as an example you know how do they change during aging and tracking that over time so outside of the biological age test metrics you know knowing knowing how the major biomarkers change during aging and tracking that over time and making sure that they're not getting worse that's another layer to this that i add but that's that's you know know just the basics somebody can get it can get very far i think on uh you know just the standard blood test at least you know four times per year just to get a represent representation of year to year change and doing that for a very long period of time right yeah but i guess like once a year is also good enough granted that you don't change a lot if you are changing your diet a lot then your routines a lot then yeah like would need to do it like multiple times but you know if you're the kind of person who just follows the same diet all the time and the same exercise routine around all the time then maybe like once a year for them is kind of good enough for i i hear i hear you on that uh if nothing else changes but then that still assumes that that one test is representative of the full year data so i think in the beginning it's important to test a lot and then you can see all right what's my average you know so say you had six tests year one six test year two all right my average age here one is 35 my average age here two is 35. Okay if i take one test the next year do i get an average age of 35 if that average age is 37 maybe it's not representative you would have to test a few more times to see how many tests you need for it actually to be representative of your full year data um i think i think you'll be missing parts of the story with one test per potentially missing you know so yeah yeah um awesome well this is very uh very thorough and very i think people are gonna love it so is there anything else you want to add in the end that we're doing cover i think is very important of course there's a lot obviously like a ton of details and uh people can check out your youtube channel for for all the details and stuff like that but like overarching like is there like something that you think absolutely everyone should do for the stowing of speed of aging yeah yeah i think i think track you know test track and optimize i you know i can't emphasize that enough uh you know yeah and then it's conquer aging or die trying that's that's the that's the model right so yeah uh also before i ask my last question where can people find you and your work yeah on youtube conquer raging or die trying uh that's basically my hashtag everywhere twitter uh linkedin facebook i'm all over the internet so um yeah yeah we'll put the links in the description and my last question is uh what's this one piece of advice or a habit that you wish you adopted sooner yeah i wish um i wish i did all of this earlier you know uh i didn't start seriously until my early 30s and you know maybe from my early 20s i wish i started earlier and then even then you know it's kind of like a tree that doesn't have solid supports can grow sideways before going you know vertical my 20s were you know alcohol and you know the college lifestyle and lots of junk food i mean i i unfortunately i have competitive eater dna where i could just eat 10 000 calories of you know some of these youtubers are eating 10 000 calories or more i have those genetics where i a whole pizza and then a gallon of ice cream and i did that for a very long time you know into my 30s even uh and uh i wish i wish i had developed this mindset sooner where it wasn't just the last eight years or so a pretty strict uh and dedicated and focused you know i wish i'd done it a lot sooner um how much that affected my potential longevity i don't know but my i'm hypothyroid and that started in my mid-20s and my diet even in my youth you know it was eat whole box of cookies and cakes and then go to the park for three hours and play basketball or baseball or whatever it was so maybe i burned it off to stay lean but just that chronic you know deficient nutrient status maybe negatively affected my thyroid hormone function and so i wish i had done all of this sooner you know um and that's kind of one reason i put the youtube out and uh just like you i've got books on the horizon that i'm that i'm planning on on doing and putting all this into a story where people can read and maybe get started earlier on the journey than me um along those lines have you so i think you're doing is youtube and the books that's all your full-time full-time job yeah yeah i've been doing that for maybe six years or seven years something like that so when you first made that transition well difficult scary challenging in terms of paying all the bills worried about that that's the only thing keeping me back from doing it as a full-time thing right um well of course yeah like in the beginning i kind of jumped into it so like i um i i had like a um summer holiday between college and i came back from uh what was it the exchange student in the uk i came back to estonia for the summer and i didn't have like any money left so my option was like go back to the work where i had been working during the summers which is like a restaurant or like i i started my blog at that time where i was just you know in the beginning i was just doing regular kind of blog post about innovative fasting or my own kind of stuff and i just decided that i'm gonna plunge into it and i did like a little bit of freelancing i wrote some helped like ghost riding and writing articles and stuff like that on this fiverr and those websites so that helped me to make some income and then i created some some books myself about you know the fasting and keto at the time as well as some guys for that and that enabled me to like get some revenue and of course it wasn't much in the beginning but it was enough to kind of not need to go to another work and finish my college and after that at the college then i started to do this more full-time cool but uh yeah it's uh it's it's kind of you know the best work to work on your health and longevity yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of torn because there's cool stuff i'm doing as a scientist that i want to keep doing but academia is you know in many in many cases it's if you don't get great well not if you don't get grant funding if reviewers don't think your project is interesting you don't get funded you stop being a scientist and i hate that about it it's it could be six months of work on a grant which potentially can be that i find interesting that would have broad uh application but you know so so i'm but there's still cool stuff i want to do cool experiments i want to do uh it's just a matter of that that grant game versus i absolutely love making videos and can do it full time and like i said write a book and put all this in a book maybe you can get a book deal instead of self-publishing like i've done in the past too but uh only because the self-publishing versus the standard book deal i mean it's more credibility people you know what i mean but uh maybe you don't get as much revenue from self-publishing but it's just that i i'm just worried about that leap in terms of self-sustaining and uh anyway so yeah you've done it so you you're proof that it can be done right so absolutely well it was a really fun talking with you and uh yeah i think it's one of the like most exciting episodes i think people will listen and uh yeah i think they learn a lot thanks seem good stuff all right it was great same here let's see if i can get to 0.62 you know that'll that'll be some fun stuff so yeah absolutely i think you know how to get there just take some time if if i can get there you've already proved that you can get there i've had six tests and haven't gotten there yet so we don't know if i can get there yeah well my goal is to get below 0.6 so like they say that that's the lowest so i'll try to get 0.59 nice nice nice good stuff yeah all right well have a nice day all right ciao
