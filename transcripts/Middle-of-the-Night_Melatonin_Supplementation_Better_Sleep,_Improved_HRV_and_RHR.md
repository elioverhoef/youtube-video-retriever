# Middle-of-the-Night Melatonin Supplementation: Better Sleep, Improved HRV and RHR?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

I usually don't have any problems falling asleep but i have a tendency to wake up often between two to five am sometimes as much as three times during that three hour period now on most nights i can get back to sleep but the more often that i wake up the higher the probability that i can't fall back asleep so with that in mind in january i started middle of the night melatonin supplementation and did that result in better sleep and then also as an interesting aside it may have also improved my heart rate variability hrv and resting heart rate rhr so why melatonin so when there's a healthy circadian rhythm the pineal gland produces melatonin which then regulates the sleep wake cycle however when there's a circadian rhythm disorder a nighttime light exposure as one example for something that can impact melatonin levels results in irregular melatonin levels uh an awakening disorder which can induce poor sleep quality which then can increase the prevalence of sleep disorders and subsequent chronic illnesses now it isn't just nighttime light exposure that can impact melatonin levels aging also impacts nighttime levels of melatonin so here are blood levels of melatonin on the y-axis plotted against a 24-hour period starting from 8 a.m on the left to 8 a.m on the uh the next day on the right so first notice that blood melatonin levels are relatively low when awake for almost all of the age groups starting from 8 am up until about 10 o'clock at night however very young kids 5 to 10 years old have higher blood levels of melatonin not only during wakefulness from 8 to 10 at night but also up until peak uh the p when peak melatonins uh happen at around 2 am so 5 to 10 year olds have the highest blood levels of melatonin at about 2 in the morning in contrast people over the age of 70 for them their peak melatonin levels are five to six times reduced when compared with five to ten year olds so uh for someone of my chronological age i'm somewhere in the middle in terms of uh where mel blood melatonin levels would be so with that in mind uh that may be contributing an age-related decline for melatonin production may be contributing to these uh many awakenings from two to five am so with that in mind i started middle of the night melatonin supplementation as a means to potentially improve sleep quality so did it so here we're looking at sleep duration and note that uh sleep duration is measured with a fitness tracker and for those who don't know which fitness tracker that i use i'm not sponsored by them so leave a comment and i'll gladly indicate which tracker that i use so for sleep duration this is data from september 2nd of 2021 that's coincidentally the day of blood test number five in 2021 uh how far back i could go is debatable but i wanted to have a relatively recent period to compare melatonin supplementation with without supplementation so starting from september 2nd of 2021 and going through a data earlier this week february 13th of 2022 so we can see i have 162 days of data as indicated by the n so the data from melatonin is in re uh no melatonin sorry is in red and then data uh with melatonin supplementation so days with melatonin supplementation is in black so i have 26 datas 26 days of data with melatonin and 136 days of data without it so first we can see that on days without melatonin supplementation my average sleep duration was 7.2 hours and then with melatonin supplementation on days with melatonin my average was 7.7 hours so we can compare these two two groups of data using a two sample t-test and when i do that we can see that these two groups of data are significantly different which indicates that i got significantly increased sleep duration 30 minutes per day on days with melatonin supplementation so getting more sleep is good news but i also noticed interesting alterations for heart rate variability and resting heart rate and heart rate variability and wrestling heart rate seem to be improved on days with melatonin supplementation when compared with the 136 days without it so first starting with data for heart rate variability and again over that 162-day period from september of 2021 through earlier this week in february and again data for no melatonin supplementation in red versus melatonin supplementation in black so starting with the data without melatonin my average heart rate variability was exactly 52 milliseconds but with melatonin it was 54.2 milliseconds and we can compare these two groups of data again with a two-sample t-test and we can see that these two groups of data are significantly different so there's a small but significantly higher heart rate variability on days with melatonin supplementation so what about resting heart rate so that's what's shown here again over that same 162-day period data for a resting heart rate without melatonin in red and data for resting heart rate with melatonin in black so without melatonin supplementation in the middle of the night my average my resting heart rate was 46.7 beats per minute for as an average over that 136 day period and then for the resting heart rate uh on days with melatonin my average resting heart rate was 45.6 beats per minute and when using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data are significantly different so there's a small but significantly lower resting heart rate on days with melatonin supplementation now note that there seem to be two outliers those two red data points that are different from all of the rest of the data points and this is an elevated wrestling heart rate on the day of and the day after vaccine dose number three so that raises the question are these between group differences affected by these by these two data points so to assess that i removed those two data points and then compared between group differences for no melatonin with melatonin and after doing that the between group differences uh remain after removal of these two data points so in other words resting heart rate is still significantly lower and heart rate variability is still significantly higher on days with melatonin when compared with not no melatonin so how does a higher heart rate variability and a lower resting heart rate fit within the context of youth versus age so we can put these data into context so a higher heart rate variability and a lower resting heart rate are found in youth so first starting with heart rate variability it declines during aging and that's what's shown here so on the y-axis is the root mean squared of successive differences rmssd that's the version of heart rate variability that my fitness tracker provides and then that data is over the 20 to 60 year old age range so uh starting with the data for men in blue and but also note that the data for women in red is similar heart rate variability declines from values approaching 80 in 20 year olds to somewhere around 40 in 60 year olds and note that i looked at the data here for uh six in the morning before the solid lines because that's when my fitness tracker provides the data so it provides it during the last sleep cycle so it's pretty close to six in the morning when compared with the dash lines which is uh six o'clock at night but nonetheless the trend is the same where heart rate variability is declining during aging all right what about resting heart rate so that increases then decreases during aging as shown here for both men in blue and women in green so we can see that for in the data for men because that directly applies to me as it's the focus of the video we can see that resting heart rate increases until about the early 50s and then it declines from about mid 50s up into 80 up until 85 years old so note that youth is characterized by a relatively low resting heart rate but a high heart rate variability and in contrast advanced age is characterized by a relatively low resting heart rate and a low heart rate variability so in my case when when considering the melatonin data i saw a heart rate variability increase and a resting heart rate decrease on days with melatonin supplementation would suggest that these data are going in the right direction in terms of youth and not age now before saying that melatonin caused these improvements let's have a look at data for other factors that may be impacting heart rate variability and wrestling heart rate so first physical activity are levels of physical activity different on days with melatonin when compared with no melatonin and the hypothesis would be that i may have been more physically active during melatonin so the melatonin supplementation period that may result in better cardiovascular fitness and then potentially an increased heart rate variability and reduced resting heart rate so here we're looking at the average daily heart rate as an index of physical activity and again the fitness tracker provides this data so that's the heart rate over the whole day the average heart rate over the whole day and again this is over the 162-day period from early september of 2021 through earlier this week in february of 2022 no data for no melatonin in red and again for melatonin supplementation in black so first looking at the average daily heart rate for no no melatonin my average daily heart rate was 57.5 beats per minute as an average and then for the days with melatonin supplementation the average daily heart rate was 57.3 beats per minute and when using a two-sample t-test those two groups of data are not significantly different so from this we can conclude that average daily physical activity was not different when comparing days with and without melatonin supplementation so what about calorie intake is calorie intake different on days with melatonin when compared with no melatonin and the hypothesis there would be a lower calorie intake during the melatonin supplementation period may or may have resulted in increasing uh heart rate variability and reducing resting heart rate so here is calorie intake and as everyone on i'm sure on the channel knows that i track my food intake every day i weigh all my food i log it using an online app and then put all that data into an excel file so we're looking at daily calorie intake on the y-axis and again plotted against time that 162-day period the first 136 days in red no melatonin versus with melatonin in black so my calorie intake during the no melatonin period was 23.72 calories per day on average and then with melatonin it was 23.36 and when you when using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data are significantly different and from that we can conclude that calorie intake was significantly lower on days with melatonin supplementation when compared with days without melatonin so to answer the question is melatonin causing alterations for heart rate variability and wrestling heart rate we can more accurately assess that question by including sleep physical activity and calorie intake in multivariate models as shown here so here we're looking at the combination of those four variables total sleep average daily heart rate daily calorie intake and melatonin so their combination in association with heart rate variability and we can see that the the combination of those four variables are significantly associated with heart rate variability as indicated by the significance f which is less than 0.05 so from that we can conclude that the combination of these four variables is significantly associated with heart rate variability now more specifically after accounting for total sleep physical activity and calorie intake in this model we can see that a relatively higher melatonin intake is significantly associated with a higher heart rate variability so you can see the coefficient for the melatonin column for the melatonin row is positive which indicates a relatively higher melatonin intake is correlated with a relatively higher heart rate variability and we can see that the p-value that's a statistically significant association after accounting for those other factors all right what about resting heart rate so again when looking at those four variables total sleep average daily heart rate daily calorie intake and melatonin their collective association with resting heart rate we can see that the significance f is again less than 0.05 so from that we can conclude that the combination of these four variables is significantly associated with resting heart rate and again more specifically after accounting for total sleep physical activity and calorie intake we can see that a relatively higher melatonin intake is significantly associated with a lower wrestling heart rate as you can see the coefficient there for melatonin is negative which indicates a relatively higher melatonin intake is significantly associated with a lower resting heart rate and again when i said significantly we can see that the p-value is less than 0.05 so from these data we can conclude that melatonin is significantly associated with heart rate variability and resting heart rate in models adjusted for other factors that may be impacting these cardiovascular fitness metrics including sleep physical activity and calorie intake and then more specifically melatonin may be helping me get more sleep but also maybe improving heart rate variability and resting heart rate so we're considering these positive data for now melatonin stays in the approach so this this will be the third supplement that is in my current approach including vitamin d in the winter and then uh methyl b12 every third day all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
