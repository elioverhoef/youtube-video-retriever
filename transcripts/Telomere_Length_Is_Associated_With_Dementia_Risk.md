Telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging and we can see that here telomere attrition otherwise known as telomere shortening is included as one of the 12 hallmarks of aging more specifically telomere length declines during aging for both men and women on the y-axis we've got leukocyte or white blood cell telomere length plotted against age from 20 year olds up through centenarians or 100 year olds and for both men and women we can see that age-related decline more specifically we can see that in youth telomere length is approximately 7.75 kilobases whereas in advanced age it's shorter at 5.75 kilobases visually we can see that represented here so telomeres which are the portions of dna at the end of chromosomes are relatively long in youth and then in senescence or advanced age we can see that the telomeres the portions of dna on the chromosomes have shortened so why is telomere length important in a recently published study it showed that relatively shorter telomeres are associated with an increased risk for the incidence of dementia so let's take a look at that data and that's what we can see here and this study included about 32 000 people average age was 55 years and it had a median 13-year follow-up so starting from the initial assessment of telomere length what was the incidence of dementia over that up to 13-year period on the y-axis we've got that relative hazard for risk of dementia plotted against leukocyte telomere length or white blood cell telomylink wbc and then when putting up our hazard ratio of one remember when the shaded purple region is completely above one or below one we have a significant association and there we can see that as telomere length increases that that's associated with a significantly reduced incidence for the risk of dementia now to potentially minimize these risks this risk we can measure and optimize telomere length so with that in mind what's my data so to find out i used true diagnostic who just doesn't measure epigenetics but they also provide measurements of telomere length in white blood cells and for the first test my average telomere length was 7.02 kilobases and note that in youth that's we would expect to see 7.75 kilobases so i've got some work to do at least based on my first test similarly test two and three weren't much better at 7.07 and 7.04 kilobases so we can see that i have room for improvement based on those first three tests from may through october of 2022. Now fortunately for the last two tests data has been better 7.13 kilobases for the january 23 january 2023 test and also 7.13 kilobases for test number five march 6th so last month last month's test now for the last test note that i took nmn with an average of 340 milligrams per day from test number four through test number five and also i took one gram of nmn for the seven day period before this test and yet there was no effect on telomere length at least for me so would enemn improve telomere length for others i don't know but for me clearly there was no impact now with that in mind going forward i'll track telomere length and correlations with diet as i now have five tests and i have a corresponding diet for each of these telomere length measurements and i can start to look at correlations and try to see where i can improve my diet to potentially potentially get closer to youthful levels 7.75 kilobases so with that in mind can teal meal length be further lengthened beyond where i have it now we'll find out and stay tuned for that update video sometime soon if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that'll be in the video's description that you may be interested in including nad quantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
