# Low Total Cholesterol: Biological Youth Or Increased Mortality Risk?

Is it possible to have low levels of total cholesterol and also have optimal health so here we're looking at my values for total cholesterol for the past 15 years total cholesterol plotted on the y-axis against time and i've measured it 36 times during that period so my range for total cholesterol my lowest value was 114 and my highest value was 185. The average value during that time is 144 milligrams per deciliter now i also presented in an earlier video that uh lower levels of total cholesterol are found in youth and that's what we see here with values of 170 and 160 for women and men respectively but uh cholesterol levels also decline towards the end of life with the arrows the black hours here declining towards the oldest age reported in that study which was about 88 years old but cholesterol levels continue to decline past 88 which i presented in my last video uh including uh centenarians semi-super centenarians and super centenarians and that's what we can see here so looking at 85 to 99 years old we can see cholesterol values of about 201 and then as we get older than that in the columns to the right we can see cholesterol goes to 172 165 and 156. So total cholesterol values in the 160 range are found in super longevity but they're also found in youth now that total cholesterol levels are low in advanced age that's actually bad for health and that's what we can see here so uh just looking at the all-cause mortality data so risk of death for all causes for 75 to 90 99 year olds in women and men we can see that lowest risk of death for all causes is uh for cholesterol levels in the 210 to 240 range and then using the data that i just showed for the centenarians in the 160 range we can see that their risk of death for all causes is significantly increased now i also have values less than 160 in fact that that average value of 144 for the past 15 years and if in looking at the age group based on my chronological age for risk of death for all causes based on total cholesterol levels um optimal here too for this age group is in the 210 to 240 range and based on my values over the past 15 years i'd be at an at least uh 40 increased risk of death for all causes so uh but lower levels of total cholesterol also found in youth so which is it am i at a higher risk of all-cause mortality or are my levels indicative of biological youth so let's have a look at some data to help clarify the story so it's been shown that having high levels of albumin and high hdl in the presence of low cholesterol in this case lower than 160 those individuals have a similar survival when compared with uh subjects who have higher levels of total cholesterol so that's we can see here in this chart with survival up to six years after the initial baseline visit and in this study the subjects are about 79 years old so this is old subjects who have local low total cholesterol and high albumin and high hdl and how they compare in terms of survival and what we can see is that the survival of those subjects who have high relatively high levels of albumin and hdl have a similar survival to the other uh total cholesterol groups in this case 161 to 239 and greater than 240. So also note that higher levels of albumin this makes sense because higher levels of valuement and higher levels of hdl are also found in youth so high albumin high hdl high total cholesterol since all of them are found in youth it would make sense that that would also be associated with the best survival or similar survival to the other cholesterol groups now we can look at this even further in subjects that only in subjects that had total cholesterol levels that were less than 160. So how does it break down versus albumen and hdl for those subjects so first highest all-cause mortality risk was present when subjects had low total cholesterol low albumin and either low or high hdl which i've boxed here that's the highest risk group and then risk starts to decrease with higher albumin so high albumin but low hdl there's a 32 risk of decreased risk of all-cause mortality risk for those subjects but the maximally reduced risk of all-cause mortality for subjects that had low total cholesterol was for high albumin while relatively high albumin which is 38 grams per liter and relatively high hdl of 47 milligrams per deciliter so the long story short is for total cholesterol less than 160 lowest all-cause mortality risk acm risk when albumin is greater than 38 grams per liter and hdl is greater than 47. So if you remember my i showed my cholesterol data earlier but what's my data in terms of albumin and hdl how do i fit into this story so this is uh 25 blood tests over the past four years and uh you can see first that my average uh albumin level is 49.4 so i'm good there i'm way higher than the 38 and how about hdl so 45.4 so i'm close to that 47 cut point so i've got a little bit of work to do i'm going to go back into my data and look for some correlations and see what i can do to continuously keep my hdl above 47. So again the take home is if your tc total cholesterol is less than 160 making sure that your albumin and hdl levels are relatively high is important for reducing all cause mortality risk all right that's all i've got um you can find me lots of places online have a great day
