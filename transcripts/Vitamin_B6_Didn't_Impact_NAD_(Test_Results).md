# Vitamin B6 Didn't Impact NAD (Test Results)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Tryptophan is converted into nad by the day novo nad synthesis pathway but as we saw in an earlier video there's an age-related decline for vitamin b6 or more specifically paradoxify phosphate p5p that may limit the conversion of tryptophan into nad and it's in support of that we saw in that video that kind urine levels increased during aging in conjunction with the age-related decline for nad so that raises the hypothesis if i increase vitamin b6 intake can i increase nad so for nad test number four i sent blood to infinity and for those who are interested in doing the same there'll be a discount link in the video subscription on that test we saw that my nad levels were 30.1 micromolar which was going in the right direction when compared with test number one 25.6 micromolar and test number two 25.3 micromolar now note that for test number four my average b6 intake was 11.3 milligrams per day and note that i track my diet every day that's how i know the amount of b6 in my diet so that 11.3 milligrams per day was significantly higher than test then for test number one and two 3.2 milligrams per day so about a 3.5 fold increase in my average b6 intake so with that in mind for test number five i then raised my average b6 intake average daily b6 intake about 3x higher to 37.2 milligrams per day and that averages for the 32-day period in between test number four to the day before test number five so did a further three-fold increase for vitamin b6 increase nad and actually it did not so my data went from 30.1 micromolar down to 22.3 micromolar and in fact this is the lowest nad level that i've had thus far over five tests so to answer the question did a further three-fold increase for vitamin b6 increase nad it did not and in my case vitamin b6 i think it's fair to conclude that vitamin b6 even over these past two tests not just this most recent test did not increase nad now all hope is not lost as we saw in the last video quinolinic acid levels increased during aging which suggests that the block the age-related block in this pathway may actually be with quinolinic acid so with that in mind in that video i focused on the conversion of quinolenic acid to nad and how we may potentially impact that which involves grape seeds or grape seed proanthocyanidin extract all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics any dequantification with ginfinity as i just mentioned green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox which has a different panel than the at-home metabolomics diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or die trying brand that link and all the other discount links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
