# Blood Test #2 in 2023: Impact of NMN?

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades and if we track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so my apologies if i've said that a million times but that's a central premise of this channel and with that in mind earlier this month i blood tested for the second time in 2023 so what's my biological age so this is that data and this is where a march 6 2023 blood test and these data are using dr morgan levine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you're interested in measuring your own biological age using levine's metric pheno age that link will be in the video's description so when entering these data we can see that my biological age is 32.8 years which is 17.3 years younger than my chronological now note that for the ninth consecutive test quests high sensitivity c-reactive protein measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter so crp could be lower than 0.3 milligrams per liter but not higher which could would lead to a lower biological age using levine's test and besides looking at data from a an excel spreadsheet if you're interested in screenshots of the blood test report all that data will be included later in the video now note that this is just one test for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 and i have 24 blood tests over that period as shown here so from 2018 to 2019 i tested three times with an average levine pheno age of 36.1 years from 2020 to 20 21 over 12 tests i averaged 35.6 years over seven tests in 2022 the levine's pheno age was 33.8 years and thus far in 23 2023 the first test was 33 years and the second was 32.8 as shown there now why that most recent test is important is because my i supplemented with nmn for the majority of the 42-day period that corresponded from the first blood test until the second blood test and my average nmn intake during that period was 340 milligrams per day now maybe that may not seem seem like it's enough so for one week prior to this test for seven consecutive days prior to this test i supplemented with a thousand milligrams of nmn per day and as we can see there wasn't a major impact on my levine's pheno age or biological age so that suggests that there was no effect for nmn and in support of that note that i've had values at least as low as 32.84 times since 2021. Now this is one metric that i used to calculate biological age the other is another is aging.ai so what's my aging.ai age so aging.ai includes 19 biomarkers and when entering the data for these 19 biomarkers i get a predicted age of 27 years so and note that that's 23.1 years younger than my chronological so just like we did for levine's test for more context let's let's have a look at previous data using aging.aih and that's we can see here this is data from 2009 to 2023 and i have 39 blood tests that correspond to aging.aih over that time span now when i first started measuring over three tests from 2009 to 2013 my average aging.ai age was 32 years so then i had the idea our three tests over five years representative so i decided to start testing more often and in 2016 starting in 2016 through 2022 i tested 34 times with an average aging.ai age of 29.9 years all right so what about in 2023 so the first test was 28 and the second test most recently was 20 seven now that also suggests because 27 is pretty close to 28 that there was no major effect for anime on aging.ai age and in support of that i've also had values as low as 27 or even 26 four times since 2016. So that would suggest that i may not need nmn for either levine's biological age or aging.ai in order to further improve them so the story is not completely closed though on nmn because i also sent blood out for epigenetic analysis on the same day at that i got these blood test data done so it's possible that nmn supplementation affected epigenetic age and i don't yet have those results i expect to have them sometime later this month so expect the video at the end of march early april now at this point in the video i then ask what may be contributing to these biological introductions including diet and or supplements and supplements besides anime of course and i'll cover that in a future video probably in a week from today but let's dig into the full blood test report as there are some interesting insights that i'd like to go through and the first is homocysteine and we can see that at 11.1 and i have other videos on homocysteine that it increases during aging so the 11.1 is going in the wrong direction so with that in mind as soon as i got these results i started serine plus vitamin b6 supplementation on march 11th of 2023 2 grams of searing per day and five milligrams per day of vitamin b6 which is more than double my current b6 intake so in a future video we'll see if that's able to reduce homocysteine also note that a major weakness in my data is dhea sulfate so there was no major bump there it's at 129 still in the 120s despite nmn and despite the hypothesis that having or potentially having higher nad would impact dhea sulfate and i'll have more on that in the next video so also by by looking at searing or using serine plus b6 supplementation i've got a hypothesis a mechanistic driven hypothesis that i'll cover in a future video that i may not only be able to reduce homocysteine but potentially increase dhea sulfate so stay tuned for that if you're interested that will be in a future video all right so then for page two of the blood test report and then last but not least if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for any dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or a microbiome composition at home blood testing diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee and all of these discount links will be in the video's description as will the link for merch which you can see here so if you want to wear the conquer aging or die trying brand that link will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
