Spermidine extends lifespan in mice and in people is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and improves cognitive function in randomized controlled trials now the first study that suggested a role for spermatine on extension of mammalian lifespan was published in 2009 and that study is shown here now in that study which was started at 24 weeks of age in male jc1 icr mice these mice were fed three different diets either low normal or high levels of polyamines so what are polyamines poly means many and amine means the amino group so nh2 nitrogen and hydrogen now three popular polyamines are putracine which can contains two amino groups spermidine which contains three amino groups and spermine which contains four amino groups all right so back to the study so when looking at the average survival or the time when half the population was dead and half was still alive so 50 survival we can evaluate median lifespan so first we can see that there was no difference in survival for the low versus normal polyamine diets but then we can see a significant significant extension of median lifespan when comparing the high polyamine diet to the normal polymean diet so which poly mean may be responsible for the extended lifespan and to answer that let's take a look at the diet composition in terms of levels of the three polyamines putrescine spermidine and spermine and that's what's shown here so starting from the left to the right we've got data for the low normal and high poly amine diets now first note in terms of macronutrients there were no significant differences in the amount of protein fat fiber or calorie content for these three different diets but then we see differences for polyamine levels obviously between the three diets so first we can see that putrescine when comparing the high with the normal polyamine diet was 1.7 fold higher in the high polyamine diet when compared with the normal polyamine diet and then spermine was 2.3 fold higher in the high poly mean chao when compared with the normal polyamine chao but then the biggest differences for polyamines was for spermidine and we can see that first in terms of absolute content uh the highest levels of all three of these polymers was greatest for spermatine which had 1540 nanomoles per gram in the high polyamine diet when compared which would compared with putricine which had 1075 nanomoles per gram and then the fold difference when comparing the high versus the normal poly mean uh diets was greatest for spermidine which is 3.5 fold higher when comparing those two diets so what about blood levels of poly means when comparing the high polyamine diet with the normal polymer diet and that's what we can see here so starting with the spermine concentration after 8 and 16 weeks on the diet there were no differences between the normal and high polyamine diets and then although it looks like there's a doubling of the blood sperming concentration after 26 weeks on the diet you know 10.1 versus 5.2 micromolar that those differences were not statistically significant uh we can see by the p-value of 0.09 there were some variable the authors of the study reported that there was variability in the sperming concentration and the high polymean group which you can see by the standard deviation of 7.1 in the high poly amine diagram for spermine all right so what about blood levels of spermidine so once again after 8 and 16 weeks on the diet there were no differences between the normal and high polymer diets but after 26 weeks on the diet we can see about a 50 or close to a percent increase in blood levels of spermatine on the high polymer diet when compared with the normal polyamine diet now blood levels of putrescine were not measured so we can't rule out that uh levels of putrescine at least in blood may have contributed to the lifespan extending effect of the high polyimmune child versus the normal but when considering that spermatidine dietary content and blood levels were significantly higher in the high polyamine diet when compared with the normal polymean diet this suggested that spermanene on its own may impact lifespan and it does as we can see here so this study was uh seven years later in 2016. Uh female c-57 black 6j mice were fed spermidine in the drinking water starting at four months of age so starting very early in life this is close to about being a teenager in human years and when looking at median survival so again the 50 survival half the population is dead half is still alive we can see that signific significantly increased medium lifespan as indicated by the greenhouse in the mice that were fed spermanine when compared with mice that were not fed sperm in the controls now what about uh spermatine uh supplementation initiated later in life can that extend lifespan so the authors of this study also evaluated that and that's what we can see here so in this case uh both male and female c-57 black six j mice were feds against burmedin in the drinking water but this time they started it at 18 months of age which is closer to middle age for a mouse which has a usual maximal lifespan of about 40 40 months so once again we can see that the spermatidine supplemented group had an increased median lifespan well what about other studies one study is nice for being able to extend lifespan with first uh with spermidine but what about have other studies replicated spermadine's lifespan extending effect and they have so in a study published in 2017 uh in this case using 10 times the concentration of spermatine as in the previous study 3 molar in the drinking water and this time supplementing from birth so as soon as the mice were born they were supplemented with spermine in the drinking water so essentially for the duration of their lifespan and when uh comparing median survival again we can see that significant extension of median survival in the spermatine supplemented mice when compared with controls now although it looks like maximalizement may have also been impacted that wasn't evaluated or reported in the study but interestingly note that sperminine does not increase lifespan and rats and in this case it was a the study was initiated where spermatine was supplemented later in life in this case at 18 months of age and again it was supplemented in the drinking water and although there was an approximate doubling of the sperminene concentration in blood which showed that they were ingesting the spermidine in the water as opposed to not drinking the water and not having an increase in blood levels of spermidine we can see that there was no increase in median lifespan in the rats so to summarize poly means and more specifically spermidine extends lifespan and mice but not in rats so what about uh sperm dean's effects on health in people so in this study which was in people a relatively small study of 829 67 year olds or at least that had an average age of 67 we can see we can eval we can see the cumulative incidence of death so all cause mortality on the y-axis plotted against follow-up which in this case was 20 years after the baseline visit so with the baseline visit they assessed uh sperm we did spermidine intake by diet and then uh evaluated how many people died uh up to 20 years later so when looking at this data we can see that the lowest all-cause mortality was present for the group that had the highest permedian intake in this case greater than 11.6 milligrams per day significantly higher people died uh in the group that had lower amounts of sperminine so in this case 9.1 to 11.6 milligrams per day and the highest all-cause mortality was present for people who or was associated uh with uh sperm intakes that were less than 9.1 milligrams per day now in data from the same study but reported a few years later future risk for cognitive impairment was also assessed in relation to spermdine intake which is shown there so using those same cutoffs so less than nine nine point one uh nine point one to eleven point six and greater than eleven point six milligrams per day of spermatine so low medium and high we can see that the group that had high levels of sperm sperminine had about a 70 percent reduced risk for future cognitive impairment when compared with the group that had less than 9.1 milligrams of spermonine per day now note that these data are associations and we can get more direct uh potent we can evaluate more potential direct effects of spermidine by evaluating it in randomized controlled trials so does spermanen impact health in rcts randomized controlled trials so to date there are two studies two two rcts that have evaluated uh sperminine's effects on cognitive function in the first it was on memory performance in older adults at risk for dementia and this study was relatively small it included 28 people with an average age of 70 years and it was a three-month study so to increase sperminine in the intervention group the innova that group was given a spermidine supplement of 1.2 milligrams per day now note that blood spermanine or other polyamine levels were not different between the two groups so the group getting the supplement and that got placebo so no difference in blood levels of sperminine or other polyamines but nonetheless in this study they reported a positive impact for spermanene supplementation on memory performance in this older adult in this older adult cohort that was at risk for dementia now in the second rct whereas the first one was in older adults at risk for dementia in this one this was in older adults suffering from dementia and evaluating the effect on increasing spermatine intake and this was a relatively larger study that included 92 subjects a little bit older age 83 years and again a three-month study so to increase sperminine levels in the intervention group wheat germ was added to bread and then the intervention group ate bread rolls so in contrast the control group ate bread rolls that were not enriched with wheat germ and as we'll see in a minute wheat germ is a uh a very concentrated source of spermidine now that uh the spermidine in the intervention group resulted in an average increase of about one milligram more spermanene per day when compared with controls and that was sufficient to raise blood levels of spermidine from 42 to 58 nanograms per ml so about a 40 increase in the intervention group when compared with controls who did not have a significant increase in their sperminine levels over the three-month study and as a result there was a an improvement in cognitive performance in the spermidine uh supplement or ser the group that had the higher spermdian intake when compared with controls who had consistent or declining cognitive performance over that three-month study so collectively uh when considering the lifespan data the associate association data for all-cause mortality and cognitive function and then these two rcts these these data suggest an important role for spermatine on health so sperminine can be relatively easily obtained by a diet if we choose wisely so which foods are rich in spermonine so i've gathered a list here and note that this list is not comprehensive you can see by the three papers that are below the table uh this is where i gathered this information from and uh it's as i said it's not a comprehensive list if you're interested in the comprehensive list i'll put the links to those papers in the video's description and actually again all of the papers that are in this video will be in the video's description so i've only highlighted the most concentrated sources of spermanene and so atop the list is wheat germ and again this is milligrams of spermatidine in uh per 100 grams of food so we can see that by just eating about 30 grams of wheat germ per day we can get to that about 12 mg per day cut off that was associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk in the earlier study other good sources of sperminine are the fermented soybean product natto green bell peppers mushrooms which is where i get the majority of my spermatid intake so i get about 10 milligrams of sperm spermany per day just for mushrooms i eat a lot of mushrooms but then also pretty good sources are found in animal products too including chicken liver and grilled chicken so by choosing wisely we can relatively easily get that 12 milligrams of spermoni per day all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to buy a hack aging come check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
