Fruit and vegetable intake how many servings per day is optimal to help answer that question let's take a look at this meta-analysis of 26 studies that included data for 1.9 million subjects so first what's optimal for fruit and vegetable intake which is what's shown here we've got the hazard ratio of total mortality or all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against fruit and vegetable intake in servings per day on the x-axis and note that one serving was 80 grams of either fruit or vegetable so when compared with a hazard ratio of one when the shaded gray region is either completely above one or completely below one we have a statistically significant association so first we can see that less than two servings of fruits and vegetables per day is associated with a significantly increased all-cost mortality risk and then as servings of fruits and vegetables increases past two servings per day we can see that all-cause mortality risk is significantly reduced all the way up to intakes of 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day so what's driving this association is it fruit is a vegetable or a combination of both so first let's look at what's optimal for fruit intake and again we're looking at the all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis now plotted against fruit intake on the x-axis so for people that consume less than half a serving of fruit per day so less than 40 grams of fruit per day that was associated with with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk and then as fruit intake increased up to about three servings per day we can see lowest all-cost mortality risk and then although risk looks like it starts to increase with higher intakes of fruit six servings of fruit per day was still significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk all right what about vegetable intake so again all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against vegetable intake and servings per day on the x so for people who consume less than 1.8 servings of vegetables per day that was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and then for greater than 1.8 servings of vegetables per day we can see a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk all the way up to eight servings of vegetables per day so based on this meta-analysis it seems that 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day that may be optimal in terms of health but what about intakes greater than 10 servings of fruit fruit and vegetable per day is that optimal and i raised that issue because here we can see my average daily fruit and vegetable intake and this is since july of 2018 through september of 2021 so the three plus year period over the last three plus years my average fruit and vegetable intake is about 2 800 grams per day which equates to 35 servings per day now i've introduced how i track this i've been tracking macro and micronutrients since 2015. In 2018 i had the idea to track individual food amounts so that's how i know how much my average intake is every day so uh at the low end of my range i've consumed uh eat still even higher than the meta analysis 27 servings per day as indicated by the black arrow on the bottom there but then as high also as 40 servings per day and note that each of these data points is the average fruit and fruit and vegetable average daily fruit and vegetable intake that corresponds to a blood test and i've fully introduced this approach in previous videos entry if you're interested in that uh there'll be a link in the right corner so how does this 35 servings per day separate into fruit and vegetable intake just like the meta analysis so here's my average fruit intake over that three plus year period and we can see that my average is 15 servings per day and with a low uh end of my range being 10 servings per day and a high end of my range being 19 servings per day so still greater than the meta analysis all right and then because 35 servings per day total fruits and vegetables minus the 15 from fruit we know that my average daily vegetable intake is 20 servings per day at the low end of my range 14 servings per day at the high end of my range as indicated by the red arrows 28 servings per day so again i'm higher than the meta analysis data for both my fruit vegetable and total fruit and vegetable intake so is 35 servings of fruit fruits and vegetables per day optimal for health so to address that no as i mentioned each data point is the average fruit and vegetable intake that corresponds to a blood test so if this amount of fruits and vegetables 35 servings is bad neutral or optimal for health we'd expect that to be reflected for correlations with big picture blood biomarkers so that's what we're gonna get gonna get into here uh correlations for my average daily fruit and vegetable intake versus the big picture biomarkers and again if you missed uh the guts of this approach again that'll be in the right corner so first what are the big picture biomarkers just to quickly review that and they include glucose which should be in anybody's strategy aimed at extending healthy lifespan and potentially longevity longevity there are three markers of kidney function four markers of liver function all the major lipoproteins um the major immune cells including neutrophils lymphocytes lymphocyte percentage and platelets red blood cell related markers including total red blood cells red blood cell volume so the mcv and then the red blood cell distribution with rdw a marker of inflammation high sensitivity c-reactive protein and then the overall biological age score with levine's phenoage and aging.ai and note that over this three plus year period i had at least 10 blood tests which in this case would be for lipoprotein a and as many as 17 blood tests so for most of these tests i have 15 to 17 blood test measurements that correspond to the dietary data for fruit and vegetable intake over that period so what's significantly correlated how does fruit and vegetable intake compare against these biomarkers so here we can see that a higher fruit and vegetable intake is significantly correlated with lower glucose with lower neutrophils and with lower creatinine which are going in the right direction because each of those variables increases during aging and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cost mortality risk whereas the percentage of lymphocytes is positively correlated with fruit and vegetable intake and that's going in the right direction because lymphocyte percentage declines during aging so for fruit and vegetable intake we've got four biomarkers going in the right direction now conversely a higher fruit and vegetable intake is correlated with a higher alt the liver enzyme alt which is going in the wrong direction relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and lower red blood cells which is going in the wrong direction because red blood cells decline during aging and relatively lower levels are associated with al also an increased all-cause mortality risk so we've got four going in the right direction and two going in the wrong direction that net score for the effective correlative effect of fruit and vegetable intake on my blood biomarkers or these big picture biomarkers is plus two now note that with the p-value of for statistical significance of zero less than 0.05 that means that 5 out of 100 comparisons may be false positives or 1 in 20 so 5 divided by 100 1 and 20. So here we're looking at 22 comparisons so we can expect maybe one of them or around one of them is a false positive association sorry correlation so with that in mind when accounting for false positive correlations it may not be net plus two but net plus one in in other words one of the four green correlations may not be a a real correlation it may be a false positive so it could be net plus one or at best net plus three so maybe one of the red uh correlations is actually a false correlation a false false positive so it would be four green and then only one red so a net of plus three now note that if the net correlative effect was overall negative so more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than in the right direction i'd aim for an overall fruit and vegetable intake that was below my average intake now conversely if if my net correlative effect was zero so the same amount of biomarkers going in the right and wrong direction i'd shoot for my average intake but because the overall net score is positive so at worst plus one at best plus three that suggests that a fruit and vegetable intake that is higher than my average intake but not my but not my highest intake i still have some correlations going in the wrong direction maybe optimal for systemic health so that would indicate somewhere in the 35 which was my average to 40 servings per day range now this data doesn't indicate whether fruit or vegetables and or vegetables are driving these correlations so just like the meta-analysis divided their data into fruit and vegetables but also separately fruit and vegetables let's see how that compares for my data to see what may be driving these correlations for the combined fruits and vegetables so first we're looking at correlations for my average daily fruit intake versus these big picture biomarkers and just as a quick aside the fruit intake my average daily fruit intake that corresponds to this blood test data is shown on the right so what's going in the right direction so again a higher fruit intake a higher average daily fruit intake is correlated with three biomarkers going in the right direction glucose neutrophils and the percentage of lymphocytes whereas two biomarkers are going in the wrong direction so higher fruits and veg higher fruit intake is correlated with lower platelets that's going in the wrong direction because platelets decline during aging and relatively lower levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk and again lower red blood cells so we've got three going in the right direction two going in the wrong direction that's a net score of plus one and when counting four false positive correlations again we can expect maybe one of these would be a false positive uh it could be a net score of zero at worst or a net score of plus two so that suggests that uh at least my average intake since we're going from a net score of zero to plus two but not my maximal intake so somewhere in between 15 to maybe 17 servings of fruit per day may be optimal based on these data now now note that i can test that by changing my fruit intake now for this dietary period that's corresponding to my blood test on monday so that started from my last blood test until this blood test coming up next week so that's about a two month period i'm currently averaging about 14.6 servings of fruit per day so i'm close to my average right on track pretty close to on track with uh this prediction based on the based on the data all right so what about vegetable intake so correlations from for my average daily vegetable intake with the big picture biomarkers and then again as a quick aside i've i've listed the vegetable intake that corresponds to this blood test data over the past three plus years so if you're interested in the data on the right check it out all right so what's going in the right direction so a higher vegetable intake a higher average daily vegetable intake is correlated with lower ldl and i've already gone over whether relatively higher or lower ldl may be optimal based on my biomarker data in a previous video so that'll also be in the right corner if you're interested so lower ldl may be optimal so in my case so vegetables being correlated with lower ldl that's going in the right direction so i've got that as green conversely a higher vegetable intake is correlated with higher vldl so very low density lipoprotein and that's going in the wrong direction uh and i'll also link to why vldl higher vldl may be bad i have a video on that so if you're interested also right corner check it out so we've got one going in the right direction one in the wrong direction that's a net score of zero and again accounting for potential false positive correlations it could be a net of minus one at worst or at best plus one so that would suggest that somewhere close to my average intake 20 servings per day of vegetables or somewhere in the 19 to 21 range may have a net neutral effect on my biomarkers so to test that if i deviate uh far from that range i'd expect to see potential changes in these blood biomarkers or if it's a real neutral effect meaning if vegetable intake at lower intakes but also potentially somewhat higher intakes have a net neutral effect on my biomarkers we'd expect to see the the amount of biomarkers going in the right direction be the same as going in the wrong direction so to test that for this blood test coming up next week for the past about two months i've been averaging 14.4 servings of vegetables per day so we'll see how that affects the biomarkers the net systemic biomarkers going forward all right that's all i've got for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
