## Transcript

Which diet is optimal for health and more specifically which diet is optimal for health from the evolutionary perspective so in part three of our conversation with dr michael rose we're going to go through data from his lab that compares health span for fruit flies that were raised on an evolutionary recent diet versus their ancestral diet so first uh before jumping into the data it's important to define some terms so on the y-axis we're looking at p subscript x m subscript x which is defined as age dependent fitness which more specifically is equal to the product of the survival probability and fecundity which is the ability to produce large amounts of offspring and that's important because you don't want to have a longer lifespan and better health span but produce less offspring so this metric incorporates the ability to live longer and healthier and also produce lots of uh children so this uh is a health span metric so i'm looking at this health span metric on the y-axis plotted against the age on the x-axis we can see that on the evolutionarily recent diet which is banana these flies have been raised on banana for about a thousand generations over 30 years about 30 years now that may seem like a lot of generations but in comparison the ancestral diet for the ancestral diet these flies have eaten apples and the exact number of generations is unknown but it is known that fruit flies drosophila have consumed apple for at least hundreds of years so with that in mind what does it look like in terms of differences for health span on the recent diet versus the ancestral diet so first we can see that there is a better age dependent fitness at younger ages on the banana diet the blue circles when compared with the uh apple diet the red circles at younger ages so uh 15 days old or younger however at older ages the flu the flies that were raised on the evolutionary recent diet banana had a worse health span when compared with the ancestral diet the apple as you can see by the stars and the black arrows so with that in mind it seems like there's better health span on an evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary recent diet in youth but a worth health worse health span at older ages when compared with the ancestral diet so what does this mean for human diets in terms of uh the optimal diet for human health at older ages and also what's what's the importance of measuring systemic biomarkers to help identify the diet that is truly best for health span of people so with these issues in mind let's return to our conversation with dr michael rose and in 2020 with grant rutledge who i believe you've met and hello um it was his doctoral thesis we showed uh the relationship between evolutionary history both recent and long term and diet and speaking of somebody you know over 60 um who started down this journey about uh 10 years ago i have had far better results from tuning ordinary foods in terms of my particular evolutionary history um than i have ever had in your vein of intervention um so i my ancestry is mostly from the northwestern periphery of eurasia which means i'm not as well adapted to agricultural foods as somebody who senses foods middle eastern or salvation and um fairly early on in my life i started losing adaptation to agricultural foods and as i got older through middle age it got worse and worse and so for my ancestry as you approach as you get into middle age you have to eat fewer and fewer agricultural foods if my ancestry were entirely from australasia like original australasia before the europeans showed up um i should never have consumed agricultural foods you know like bread and milk are toxic for people with entirely indigenous australian ancestry and so there's a spectrum from the peoples who are wholly unadapted agricultural foods because they didn't eat them at all before 200 years ago which is like an instant and evolutionary time two people from you know places like iraq or pakistan would be very well adapted to grain-based and milk-based diets potentially into the 50s but i think by the time every human reaches their 60s they are no longer adapted agricultural foods because of the ways in which the forces of natural selection detune with age and a response to a recent evolution and change which if people go to my google scholar page and look up the most recent publications in 2020 you'll see two in my opinion fantastic publications from grant rutledge r-u-t-l-e-d-g-e on how to tune your diet according to your ancestry it's something besides your own personal anecdote in in how getting rid of the grains in your in your diet actually improved your intestinal health but beyond that uh what i guess you didn't mention was that uh you actually switched uh fruit flies who are raised on uh in lab diets i guess it's on banana banana based and molasses [music] closer to their ancestral diets which is what more apple-based or uh fruit fruit fly right so and that extended their lifespan relative to the uh lab-based diet of molasses or was it banana i can't can't remember it's banana and molasses and the banana and molasses diet is um a diet which some of our populations have adapted to for a thousand generations that's actually longer than the period of time since the revolution in europe substantially longer and nonetheless they sometimes those flies perform better when young on their version their agricultural diet meaning their recent evolutionary diet but at later ages um like our 60s or late 50s a diet they have not seen for a thousand generations is better for them which is if somebody had told me about this experiment 20 years ago i wouldn't believe it but but that's what the math suggested uh math done with mike called with larry muller um and that's what grant's experiments have shown is that long abandoned diets if you have if a species has recently changed its core dietary practices and by recently clearly means you know less than 10 000 generations so um and with respect to agricultural diets there's no human population which goes back more than a thousand generations an agricultural diet so the principles are very general because the math is completely general it's not there's not nothing specific about preflights or humans in the mat and it's very solid and grant's strong inference experimentation has supported that mathematical result um so that turns out to be a pretty fantastic um multi-supplement approach where those supplements are really foods and you eliminate the toxic things which for people over 50 are grains rice corn food derived from milk from any mammal and legumes and your health will get a lot better it should also be said that brand new industrial food products that are novel to the human diet since 1850 nobody's adapted to high fructose corn syrup nobody's adapted to processed seed oils um nobody's adapted to trans fats those are nobody's adapted to nitrites as a preservative those are somewhere in the toxin to poison the spectrum so so then uh when considering when considering all right so i get i get that after a certain age we're not evolutionarily adapted you know we can get away with eating those foods at a younger age but when you get to a certain age and then we're just not evolutionarily adapted because millions of years of evolution we grew up you know we existed on a certain diet so but you know not that i'm trying to justify uh including the the foods that we didn't evolve uh eating but uh you know just as there are you know uh about five percent of centenarians who can get there by smoking cigarettes not that i would recommend smoking cigarettes you know because ninety-five percent of the people get there are not smoking but exactly i think at the end of the day it's important to uh you know have some objective markers of health because if somebody can't just you know because if they enjoy eating in a certain way and they have biomarkers and health that suggests that overall it's either net neutral or beneficial then you know continue but i hear what you're saying for most people that is not going to be the case but it's region specific right as you mentioned
