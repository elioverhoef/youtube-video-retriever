# Diet, Supplements That Correspond To A 13y Younger Biological Age (Blood Test #6 In 2024)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In the last video when using dr morgan lavine's biological age calculator pheno age we saw that my biological age was 13 years younger than the chronological so what might be contributing to these data so first let's take a look at prescription meds for those who are familiar with the channel this isn't a surprise but for those who are new welcome and i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my early 20s so i've been taking leo thyroxin and the current dose is 137.5 micrograms per day so i've been taking leo thyoxin every day since my early all right what about supplements so the first is generally a staple vitamin d i live in boston so eight or 9 months out of the year i can't get adequate sun exposure so i supplement with vitamin d for the 42-day period that corresponded to this test and note just to define what that 42-day period is it started immediately after blood test number five which was on july 26th and it lasted through the day before blood test number six which was on september 5th so that period is 42 days in between blood test so for that 42-day period i supplemented with 1,000 ius for 25 of those days and then for three of those days 2,000 iuse so why did i increase vitamin d well in my data for whatever reason it's inversely correlated with the nighttime respiratory rate which i know is a marker of immune activation and that's a whole story for another day but to test that correlation i increase vitamin d to see if i could reduce the nighttime respiratory rate and potentially reduce immune activation potentially improve biomarkers like hrv and resting heart rate the next supplement that i supplemented with was nicotinic acid 50 to 60 mig per day as very low levels increase nad at least in my case so for this for this test it was for 28 of the 42 days that corresponded to this to this period i also supplemented with nmn for three of the 42 days at 800 to 1,000 milligrams per day for those three days and i should say that was kind of a messing around with nmn for those three days i just wanted to see if i subjectively felt different taking nmn versus lowd do nicotinic acid and i didn't so i'm happy to use nicotinic acid as as it's cheaper and it basically does the same thing as nmn raise nad but at a far lower uh concentration all right and that's it no other geroprotectors or senolytics for this test and the emphasis is is on for this test because those who follow me on patreon know that on september 10th i started rap ay and i didn't do that with the goal of hey let's just see what happens for whatever reason in my data candida antibody levels more specifically candida igg has been elevated for all of the tests in 2024 which suggests that i had an active infection at some point in the past and my body has to keep antibody levels at a relatively high level to suppress candida and i don't want that to be the case i want candida levels to be systemically low now rapy is a known antifungal so i took rapy specifically with the with the goal of reducing candy to igg i tested that on friday results will be in in about a week they'll be posted on patreon first so if you're interested in that check it out uh so note that the story for sub prescription meds will be different for blood test number seven as it will include rapid all right that's it for supplements prescription meds no geo protectors or scol linic which brings us to diet what diet composition corresponded to the 42-day period for this test and that's what we'll see here we're going to take a look at the average daily dietary intake and note that i weigh all my food i've weighed all my food since 2015 so this is as close to accurate as one can get for quantifying dietary intake the full list is shown here and you can see that 55 foods are on the list technically it could be 57 because i included nn but since i also supplemented with vitamin d and nicotinic acid that would bring it to 57 so 54 foods without the supplements the list is ranked in grams from highest to lowest with three exceptions coffee so that's that's not i wasn't drinking 7 ounces per day that's one 12 o coffee nothing fancy just uh black coffee that i made at home that's how i like it no sugar nothing else straight black green tea 20 ounces per day and i note that i use loose leaf organic green tea sourced from japan if you want to use what i use there's a discount link in the video's description and then also pizza which is ranked in calories and i'll cover the pizza when we go over the cheap meals or cheat cheat day section of the diet all right so what about experiments for this test now at this point when considering my biological age results using feno ag are pretty good 13 years for this test but for most tests in uh over the past two years it's been generally 15 to 16 16 years younger than the chronological so i'm not trying to blow up the system i'm trying to make small tweaks with the goal of optimizing weak spots while still keeping the core of the biomarkers relatively useful so what experiments did i do for this test so the primary one was reducing fructose intake and for this test i reduced it from 57 gram per day which was for the last test to an average of 48 gram per day for this test and that may seem like a lot but as we'll see later on that's my lowest fructose intake at any point corresponding to any blood test over 50 blood tests since 2015 so why why did i do that well i look at correlations for not just macros and micros and foods i look at correlations for all of that with biomarkers and in the case of fructose with a core of 25 biomarkers that represent major organ systems kidney liver metabolic health inflammation etc a relatively higher fructose intake in my case is significantly correlated with a net of six biomarkers going in the wrong direction relative to the right in terms of how those biomarkers associate with aging and all cause mortality risk so to test that correlation if i reduce fructose intake i should see at least six biomarkers improving so that's that was the the major experiment for this test and when considering that my feno age was 13 years younger and that's not my best data that's actually my worst data of the year one could argue that cutting the fructose may not be good for my biomarkers or at least being a part of the story for it not being uh good you know and pushing me towards the best data for my biomarkers nonetheless what did i cut so for those who have been asking for many videos why so many strawberries well we'll see because i actually cut strawberry intake from about 500 grams per day to 320 grams per day for this test and one way i include the strawberries in the daily diet is with a smoothie that includes beets beets also contain a lot of uh fructose as sucrose so half of sucrose is fructose and we considering i was eating about 300 gram per day of beets prior to this test for test number five i cut that to 127 gram per day which saved a little bit of fructose and then also in that smoothie is uh fresh fresh parsley so curly parsley so because i cut the smoothie i cut the strawberries i cut the beets i also cut the parsley from an average of 62 gam per day to an average of about 24 gam per day and note that the parsley's in there for the appenine with the goal of inhibiting cd38 trying to keep ned relatively high and avoiding any age related decrease i also cut a watermelon intake watermelon also contains uh fructose and then i increased uh tomatoes which i i didn't go through i didn't highlight with arrows on the list but i increased tomatoes to try to keep my lopine levels uh constant test over test nonetheless i cut watermelon from about 210 g to about 170 g per day all right so that's it for the major cuts but just as a note i also kept mushrooms relatively low or in the same ballpark as where they were for the last test because i had a hypothesis that too much nicotinamide for mushrooms may be increasing my homosysteine and i covered that in an earlier video and if you missed it that will be in the right corner so to test that hypothesis i repeated the experiment if i keep mushrooms low will i see homosysteine at my lowest level over the past 3 years or so once again and unfortunately that wasn't the case homocysteine did indeed go up by a little bit which suggests that it wasn't necessarily nicotinamide too much nicomide from the mushrooms it may be that a higher protein intake as i documented in that earlier video may be related to lowering homosysteine at least in my case and i plan on covering that in a future video so stay tuned for that all right i also increased oats so this is steel cut oats not the the the what is it the the steamed i didn't i didn't use the steamed roll do i use steel cut oats which i cook and i increase that from an average of about 1 gram per day to 53 gam per day for this test so why why oats well in my data relatively higher fat and protein intakes are significant correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right and we considering that i was doing the fructose experiment i couldn't increase fruit intake so that only leaves whole grains so i didn't go with barley barley also is a rich source of nicotinamide and i love barley whole grain you know the whole grain barley but i didn't want to push nicotinamide higher and potentially affect the homo homo cyan experiment with mushrooms so i kept barley relatively low and then included oats and even though i like oats a lot as we can see it was a part of a 13-year uh younger biological age but that's again not my best data so whether that was oats whether that was the fructose or parsley i don't know but this overall recipe wasn't great for my biomarkers so i've since shifted it back to where it was for prior tests a little bit higher fat less whole grains more nuts and seeds with the goal of trying to get closer to the average 15 to 16 year younger biological age relative to the chronological or even better if i can all right so cheap meals we already saw that pizza and that's one slice of pizza i wasn't eating 16.9 calories of pizza every day that's insane that's one slice of costco pizza uh over this 42-day period on two of the other days i also had uh close to the standard the standard for whatever reason i like you know homemade reese's peanut butter cups so chocolate mixed with peanut butter i did that on one of the days but i also mixed some uh mixed berry jelly for an additional sweet um and then on the second day i had just the peanut butter mixed with jelly now we can quantify junk calories to see how clean the diet is so the pizza the costco slice 710 the chocolate 550 mixberry jelly about 320 and that total is about 1,600 calories from quote unquote junk and when divided by the total amount of calories consumed for this uh 42-day period that's 1.8% of total calories in other words the diet was 98% clean now do i have to go even cleaner to get closer to the 15 to 16e average biological age reduction relative to chronological age that'll part that'll be part of the story for the next uh few tests to test that hypothesis all right so this list is ranked in grams and and as i show for each of these videos what what if we rank the list in terms of top contributors from calories and that's what we'll see here so this is the top 10 foods for the average daily calorie intake over that 42-day period that corresponds to blood test number six and note that this uh list is generated by chronometer if you want to track your own d own data own diet with chronometer discount link in the video's description so a top the list as it has been for many tests and will continue to be because sardines have a net positive score with those 25 biomarkers so i have no plans to take them out or reduce their intake actually i've gone higher for the next test to test its correlation with or to test the protein correlation with homoy so sardin is at top the list what about the remainder of that list so without going through all of the foods eight of the foods on this list are the same as they were for uh test number five and again not trying to blow up the system trying to keep the core while making small tweaks to try to improve weak spots so what what came into what entered the top 10 were oats and almonds and what left were beets and brazil nuts so i reduced braz brazil nut intake because i was testing the hypothesis that higher selenium may uh impact the free t3 to free t4 thyroid hormone ratio and it didn't so i cut it basically back in half because it didn't make a dent on that or other biomarkers all right what about macronutrients how does that break down for test number six in terms of average daily calorie intake 2145 this is close to my lowest intake since 2021 which was 2076 i may push it lower over the next few tests but for test number seven it'll the goal is to be pretty close to 2150 not go lower or higher just to stay at that level before deciding to go lower to see what is the lowest you know the bottom of the u-shape in terms of optimizing biomarkers average protein intake for the 42-day period was 100 gram per day for those who want to calculate grams per kilogram body weight my current body weight is about 141 pbs and note that i weigh myself every day that's not an estimate that's pretty close to accurate 140 and a half to be exact so uh in terms of kilog it's about 64 kg so this is about 1.6 g of protein per kilogram body weight which has been shown to maximize muscle mass and strength as a result of regular exercise so i'm right there in terms of the protein intake it'll be higher for test number seven though by about 10 to 15 grams per day in terms of percentage of calories from protein in the diet about 19% all right next up fat intake that's what we can see here average daily fat intake was about 82 gram per day which is 34% of of total calories the total fat was 34% of total calories for this test and then just for comparison let's take a look at test number five we can see that average daily fat intake was intentionally in the same ballpark 82 gam per day for this test 83 g per day for the last test and i did i did another experiment here though even though total fat wasn't uh was was basically about the same and that was saturated fat so as you may have have seen in recent videos for horvath epigenetic age and the dna methylation based estimation of tiir length for whatever reason coconut butter and its saturated fatty acids are significantly correlated with an older horvath epigenetic age and a shorter tiam length so to test that hypothesis i cut saturated fat int intake from coconut butter and following the correlation for two tests now you can see for this test that it's uh they're about the same so i did that experiment now for two tests i don't yet have that data to see if it if if the result was repeatable so keep sat fat low do i get good horvath and t length result results but nonetheless for test number seven i've increased the sad fat and coconut butter to do other experiments but again note that this small tweaks without blowing up the system and omega3 and omega 6 essentially the same test number six versus test number five and although monounsaturated fat was higher for test number six by 2 grams this is a pretty close to insignificant increase all right next up carb intake so that's what we can see here total carbs 291 g per day which seems like a lot but total carbs equals uh net carbs sorry equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake was 84 g per day and when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 207 g per day we can then multiply that by four calories per gram to get a 39% net carb percentage of total calories now also note that fiber contributes calories to the diet and that's because soluble fiber which is about 20% of the total fiber intake is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids so a fraction of total fiber is converted into fat and that amount is about 180 calories or 8% so now we can calculate the net macros that correspond to this test so 43% fat so the 34% without the amount coming from fiber fermentation by gut bacteria 34% plus that 8% around 8% we get 43 close to 43% 39% net carbs and about 19% from protein now also note that i don't track correlations with total sugars but just showing the fructose data so fructose equals a total fructose sorry equals fructose plus sucrose / two and when adding that together you can see as i mentioned earlier 48 g per day which is now my new my new record for lowest fructose intake over the 50 plus test since 2015 but again that doing that may have not have been great for the biomarkers and whether that was because i cut fructose or i cut other stuff whether it's it's cutting the beets or the parsley or increasing oats i don't know but that we'll test that hypothesis as i increase fructose back to the 57 or a little bit higher for the next few tests all right what about micronutrients so i'll just pull up the full list of vitamins and minerals and for anyone that's starting on this journey what i always recommend is always to try to make sure you can get at least the rda for all vitamins and minerals how high above the rda for some of the vitamins and minerals is debatable and very individual and i use the correlations which are on patreon all biomicro correlations with diet foods macros and micros are on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out but i follow those correlations to intentionally go higher than the rda for many micronutrients so without highlighting too many for example vitamin k that's about 20x higher than the rda or adequate intake which is about 100 micrograms per day nasin is about 5x higher and then you can see all of the carotenoids alpha and beta carotene beta considered an adequate intake or what's recommended you know based on what what we should be eating all right that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biack aging
