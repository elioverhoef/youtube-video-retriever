By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

In my last video we saw that my biological age was 35.4 years which is 13.7 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai my biological age was 28 years which is 21 years younger than my chronological so what's contributing to these data so in this video i'm going to go over what supplements and what my cardiovascular cv metrics heart rate variability hrv and a resting heart rate what those values are and how they may contribute to these biological age data so first in terms of supplements there are three main supplements that i've taken for a long time these are levothyroxine so i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've taken levothyroxine for more than 20 years 137 and a half micrograms per day and then in the winter i suffer supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day and then i've been experimenting with methyl b12 off and on uh once every three days to try to keep homocysteine at a reasonable level so a relatively new addition to my supplements are is melatonin and for those who are familiar with the channel i included that a couple weeks before the uh in the middle of january so uh that correspond to blood test number one but i included it more often during this period that corresponded to blood test number two and my average melatonin intake was 194 micrograms per day for the 49 day period that corresponded to test number two and if you're interested in why i included melatonin into my approach i leave i'll leave a video in the upper right corner all right so what about cardiovascular again cv metrics so here we're looking at heart rate variability hrv for test number one versus test number two in 2022 so for test number one so the black circles each circle corresponds to one day's worth of data and my fitness tracker provides these data automatically and if you're interested in which fitness tracker that i wear i'm not sponsored so i'm not going to give them a shout out so just leave a comment and i'll be glad to indicate which one that i use so for test number one that was the period from december 13th 2021 through january uh 23rd of 2022 so that's a 42 day period and during that period my average heart rate variability was about 51 milliseconds so what about for test number two so that period included from january 24th so the day of the blood test through march 13th of 2022 so that was a 49 day period so my average heart rate variability during that 49 day period was 55.7 milliseconds so we can compare whether these two groups of data are significantly different or not by using a two-sample t-test and when i do that or when i did that these two groups of data are indeed significantly different as we can see the p-value is less than 0.05 the threshold for statistical significance so from that we can see that there was a significantly higher heart rate variability for test number two when compared with test number one all right what about resting heart rate rhr so that's what we can see here and again comparing test number one data so that 42 day period versus test number two period so that 49 day period has shown here so first for test number one my average resting heart rate was about 47 beats per minute but then for test number two it was very close to 45 beats per minute and when using a two-sample t-test we can see that these two groups of data are also significantly different so a lower resting heart rate for test number two when compared with test number one so cumulatively we can see that i was able to significantly reduce my resting heart rate and increased heart rate variability for test number two when compared with test number one in 2022 so as a quick aside note that for test number one in 2022 i was 16.4 years younger so my biological age actually got a little bit worse for test number two using levine's phenotypic gauge calculator and then also for aging.ai i was 23 years younger for test number one in 2022 whereas i was about two years older or a little bit worse for test number two so slightly worse biological age data for test two versus test one but better cardiovascular metrics so that raises the question should improved cardiovascular metrics be indicative of a younger age so why would i think that may or could be true so to address that let's take a look at aging related data for resting heart rate and heart rate uh variability so first how does resting heart rate change during aging and that's what's shown here and this is a study of about 92 000 people and the link for this study and the next will be in the video's description so first we can see that the average resting heart rate increases during aging for both men in blue and women in green uh from about 20 years old to 50 years old and then after age 50 we can see that resting heart rate then declines during aging all the way up through 85 years old for both men and women now note that a relatively low resting heart rate of 62 can be found in youth in 20 year olds but it can also be found in seven-year-olds so that raises the question is the resting heart rate reduction from test number one to test number two indicative of cardiovascular aging or youth so age-related data for heart rate variability can can provide more context so how to for that context how does heart rate variability change during aging and that's what's shown here and on the y-axis we're looking at the rmssd that's the measure of heart rate variability that's provided by my fitness tracker and what we can see is when looking at the median values for men in blue which are just highlighted with the solid black line and as a quick note uh this is data for heart rate variability that's obtained at six in the morning and my again my fitness tracker provides these data automatically uh during the last sleep cycle which is very close to six in the morning um but also note there is data for heart rate variability the dashed lines which is people who had the heart rate variability measured at six o'clock at night so it's a little bit lower at night when compared with the morning data but nonetheless we can see that heart rate variability declines during aging from values approaching 80 in 20 year olds two values approaching 40 in 60 year olds so note that in older ages we can see that there's a relatively low wrestling heart rate but also a relatively low heart rate variability and in contrast in youth youth is characterized by low resting heart rate but then a high heart rate variability so to put my data into this context my average heart rate variability for this most recent test test number two could also be the median value for someone about 19 years younger so that would argue that heart rate variability could be a good measure of a younger age but also note that a heart rate variability of 56 milliseconds is also found within the shaded region which is the heart rate variability range for all age groups whether they're young or older so at worst i think it's fair to say that 56 milliseconds is at the high end of the range heart rate variability range for my chronological age so i seem to be doing better than the median uh value for someone at my chronological age for heart rate variability all right so what's contributing to the test to test improvements for these cardiovascular metrics so first let's have a look at body weight and how it may impact heart rate variability and resting heart rate and we're looking at body weight data for that corresponds to test number one versus test number two again in 2022 and i weigh myself every morning and then i record that data into a spreadsheet so first for test number one my average body weight was 154 pounds exactly 154 and then for test number two for that 49 day period my average daily heart uh um sorry body weight was 153.4 pounds and when using a two-sample t-test these two groups of data are significantly different so from that we can conclude that there was a lower average daily body weight even though it was a small difference it's still lower significantly lower for test number two when compared with test number one in 2022 so why is this important what's how how may body weight impact heart rate variability and resting heart rate so here we're looking at heart rate variability versus body weight bw starting from august of 2018 which is when i first started using the fitness tracker through march of through this month march of 2022 and the little n is how many days of data that i have so that's more than 1300 days of data during that span and each data point corresponds to one day's worth of data so for heart rate heart rate variability's correlation with body weight we can see that it's a an inverse correlation in other words as body weight increases heart rate variability decreases and we can see that that's a significant correlation because the p-value is less than 0.05 now conversely as my body weight has approached 150 pounds heart rate variability approaches 60 milliseconds which if you remember from the last slide is approaching youthful values so what about resting heart rate so that's what's shown here over the same time period of more than 1300 days and in this case we can see a positive or an increasing correlation so as body weight increases wrestling heart rate also increases and again that too that p value is lower than 0.05 so this is a statistically significant correlation so also note that at the end other end of that chart as body weight approaches 150 pounds my resting heart rate approaches 45 beats per minute so collectively that indicates that resting heart rate and heart rate variability approach approach youthful values as my body weight decreases so that's one aspect or one variable that may impact these cardiovascular metrics another obviously would be physical activity so how may that impact heart rate variability and resting heart rate so to assess that i'm going to look at the average daily heart rate as an index of daily activity so my fitness tracker provides not just the resting heart rate but my average heart rate for the whole day so how does that relate to heart rate variability and resting heart rate so here we're looking at the adhr for the first test versus the second test in 2022 and for the first test my average daily uh heart rate as an again is an index of physical activity daily physical activity was 57 beats per minute and for test number two it was 56.2 beats per minute now in this case these two groups of data are not significantly different even though the p-value is somewhat close to 0.05 it's higher so we can't conclude that these two groups of data are different we can't conclude that the 56 is significantly lower than 57 for test 2 versus test 1. So this suggests that daily physical activity amounts uh didn't contribute to improvements for heart rate variability and resting heart rate for test number two that it may just be that small reduction in body weight that may have driven the relatively small improvements for the cardiovascular metrics for test two versus test one so how does physical activity impact or average daily physical activity impact potentially impact these cardiovascular metrics so that's we can see here uh first we're looking at heart rate variability versus the average daily heart rate and note that the the date range starts from april 2020 through march of this year and that's because i didn't have the idea to start recording these data in my spreadsheet until uh april of last year i wish i started tracking this stuff you know when i started tracking everything in 2018 but unfortunately i just didn't have that idea so here we can see that the higher the level of my average daily average daily heart rate or the average uh physical activity the higher my physical activity each day that's significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability as shown there so to that suggests that too much daily activity is going to be bad for heart rate variability all right what about resting heart rate so now we can see a an increasing correlation rate positive correlation in other words as daily activity increases resting heart rate increases so that suggests that too much daily activity is bad for resting heart rate so to sum these two uh two groups of data up too much daily activity and too often may result in sub-optimal heart rate variability and resting heart rate values which then raises the next question what's the optimal amount of daily physical activity that can optimize both of these cardiovascular metrics so for me it seems like keeping my data for uh somewhere in the 55 to 60 range whether it's average the average daily heart rate 55 to 60 beats per minute that may be the best path for optimizing both resting heart rate and heart rate variability however it's easier said than done sometimes responsibilities of life get in the way and the average daily heart rate there'll be more activity on that day than than there should be uh so in that case i would have to try to better manage my uh average day hurry the next day to try to maximize recovery so that's an important point because finding the balance between active days and also rest days is important because as these data show if i'm too active too often that's going to result in sub-optimal cardiovascular fitness metrics all right what i haven't yet covered though is diet composition how does that contribute or what how does that correspond to blood test number two data and that will be coming soon so stay tuned for that in the next video alright that's all for now if you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
