# Microbes Affect The Hallmarks Of Aging: Mitochondrial Dysfunction (Part II)

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Microbes affect the hallmarks of aging in particular mitochondrial dysfunction uh so this is part two and if you missed part one of this series uh you can click on the video in the right corner so sars cov2 the virus that corresponds to the cova-19 disease when that virus enters cells that causes an increase in viral rna non-coding rna and rna transcripts to manipulate the mitochondria which causes the mitochondria to be hijacked and as a consequence mitochondria eject their dna some of their dna into out of the mitochondria into the cytosol now uh to look at some of that data here we're looking at uh mitochondrial dna for the cytochrome b gene y mt b on the y axis uh in blood and uh we're comparing how much of that mitochondrial dna is in patients that were alive at the end of an 87 day follow-up in patients that were diagnosed with the sars cov2 infection or that die so what we can see is for people that were alive at the end of the 87 or up to 87 day follow-up levels of mitochondrial dna in blood were less when compared with people who died after the up to 87 day follow-up so this suggests that the sars code cov2 infection is causing mitochondrial stress mitochondria inject some of their dna and we see an increase in that mitochondrial dna in in their blood now plasma levels of mitochondrial dna increase during aging is aging characterized by an increased vital burden so let's have a look at data so here we're looking at again plasma levels of mitochondrial dna so uh it mitochondria dna is supposed to be in mitochondria within cells it's not supposed to be uh out in the blood you know freely floating around so that's on the y-axis and it's plotted against age all the way up to about a hundred years old and what we can see is that starting in the 30s there's a significant increase in the amount of mitochondrial dna that's in the blood going all the way up up to 100 years of age so when considering the data from the previous slide does viral burden increase during aging as a potential explanation for why mitochondrial dna would be found at an increased amount during aging so uh one potential candidate for an increased viral burden during aging is herpes simplex virus 1 hsv1 also known as human herpes virus 1 hv1 uh and the seroprevalence so the presence of hsv1 in blood increases during aging so let's have a look at this data so this is a data from nhanes two two different studies and hence two and then hinge three and uh when looking at the sample sizes of these studies we're looking at about thirty six hundred and names two and about twelve thousand and nine h3 so about 16 data for about 16 000 subjects and what we can see is as a function of age starting from the 12 to 19 year olds all the way up to 70 to 74 year olds we can see that the presence of hsv and blood increases from 40 to 44 all the way up to more than 90 percent so a significant increase in the presence of hs hsv and blood during aging now this data is for uh people in the united states uh nhanes ii and nh3 were u.s based uh studies uh to to support this hypothesis what about data in other countries is there an increase in age-related increase in hsv in the blood during aging so here's data from uh two of those countries the top being poland and the bottom uh greece so first let's have a look at the pollen data and on the y-axis we're looking at the pre-serial prevalence of hsv in blood as a function of age on the x axis and what we can see is that 70 about 75 of the people who were 15 to 19 years old had uh hsv in their blood whereas people who are older than 50 had more than 99 uh hsv in their blood now similarly in greece we can see that when uh starting at less than one years old so babies that had 30 to 40 hsv in blood uh when compared with uh people over 60 or over 50 sorry uh the presence of hsv in blood hsv1 was uh almost 90 so again significant increases in the blood of hsv-1 during aging now although i showed the data that people who are infected with coronavirus coron virus have an increase of plasma levels of mitochondrial dna that doesn't mean that every virus is going to trigger that same effect so is there evidence that hsb1 uh leads to my increase in mitochondrial dna being ejected from mitochondria as a potential uh explanation for why mitochondrial dna increases in the blood during aging so there is data that that that shows that to be true so when looking at uh herpes virus one uh hsp1 uh when that infects cells that causes mitochondrial stress mitochondria in as a response to that release some of their dna uh that mitochondrial dna that's now in the cytosol that was supposed to be in mitochondria triggers a an intracellular signaling cascade that reaches the nucleus of the cell which then turns on antiviral gene expression and because of that the uh proteins are produced that lead to the inhibition of viral replication now as a further explanation this is just one example or two examples of viruses that impair mitochondrial function through ejecting levels of mitochondrial dna from mitochondria but as a further explanation for the age-related uh increase for mitochondrial dna are other viruses or microbes involved and this is an emerging field we need more data so that's all i've got for now you can find me lots of places online have a great day
