# Blood Test #7 in 2023: 15 - 21y Younger Biological Age

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic health can aging and disease risk be slowed so apologies if you've heard that a billion times but for people that are new to the channel that's the central premise of the youtube channel so with that in mind earlier this week i blood tested for the seventh time in 2023 so what's my biological age and we'll see that data here this is using dr morgan lavine's phoenix typic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you have blood test data and want to calculate your own biological age using this test that link it's a free downloadable link uh it's an excel file so you can use it any time will be in the video's description so when entering the nine component biomarkers and chronological age for this test i get a biological age of 35.6 years which is 15.2 years younger than my chronological now note that for the 14th consecutive test quest so the lab that i used their high sensitivity c reactor protein measurement was less than 0.3 mg per liter so that's their upper limit of detection they can't detect below that so crp could indeed be below 0.3 mig per liter but not higher so in other words the biological age of 35.6 years could be a little bit less because crp could could be less than 0.3 mig per liter and rather than looking at data entered into a spreadsheet screenshots of the lab report will be included later in the video now note that this is just one test and it's important to not just focus on one test year to year because does that truly represent changes year-over-year so for more context let's have a look at biological age results since 2018 as i now have 29 blood tests over that period and that's what we can see here so in 2018 to 2019 i only have three tests with an average age of 36.1 years and then i tested 12 times six each year in 2020 and 2021 with an average lavine age or phen typic age biological age of 35.6 years i was able to reduce that in 2022 to 33.8 years and note that i had videos on the channel for each of the tests over the past few years so if you miss that they'll be in playlist on the channel so 33.8 year average in 2022 and then for the seven tests in 2023 it was a bit worse than 2022 at 34.7 years but still better than the 35.6 from 2020 to 2021 now rather than looking at year-to-year averages we can compare by a two sample t test whether differences between these groups of data 2020 to 2021 versus the last 14 tests are significantly different and when i do that or when i did that using a two sample t test the 12 tests with an average age of 35.6 years was significantly higher than the last 14 tests from 2020 to 2020 2022 to 2023 so in other words i've been able to significantly reduce it over the past 14 tests relative to the 12 test in 2020 to 2021 so how good is this test i haven't yet introduced that and it's been a while since i've shown that data on the channel although there are older videos that have included it so how good or not is this test pheno wage for uh chronological age so to first assess that let's take a look at pheno age again this is a metric of biological age how good is its correlation with chronological age and that's what we can see here on the y axis we've got phenotypic age again this is the of biological age using lavine's test plotted against chronological age on the x-axis from the 20 to 90e age range and these data were generated using the nanes 4 study which included more than 11,000 people so in terms of the correlation we can see that it's almost perfectly linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 note that for a positive correlation a correl correlation coefficient of 1.0 is perfectly linear so that the lavine test has a correlation coefficient of 0.96 is very strong and close to as good as it can get now in a second study using the n hanes 3 cohort which included more than 9900 people the lavine test had a similar strong correlation with chronological age of 0.94 in other words lavine's test this pheno ag test again as a metric of biological age is strongly correlated with chronological age so to put this 0.94 to 0.96 into perspective this is as good as the best epigenetic clock which is the horvath clock for predicting chronological age and if you missed the horvath clock data i presented that in a video last week including nine blood tests so far for my own data so if you missed it it'll be in the right corner check it out all right so what about all cause mortality risk how something is associated with age as part of the story is is is indeed part of the story but how does it relate to uh risk of death from all causes all cause mortality risk and that's what we can see here so for every oneyear increase in pheno wage that's associated with a significant 9% increase for risk of death for all causes now what about cause specific mortality because all cause mortality breaks down into cause specific mortality including cvd cardiovascular disease so we can see that for a one-year fenal wage increase that's associated with a 10% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease similarly a 7% increase in cancer mortality it's not associated with alzheimer's disease related mortality a 20% increase for diabetes related mortality and a 9% increase for chronic respiratory diseases and note that the p value for each of these associations on the right are all less than 0.05 so pheno age lavine's test for measuring biological age is significantly associated with all cause mortality risks and many cause specific mortalities again p value is less than 0.05 with the exception of the alzheimer's disease related mortality now this isn't the only biological age metric that i use i also use aging. So let's take a look at that data so aging. Is also free to use and again i'm not affiliated or sponsored with morgan lavine or aging. These are just easy free uh tools that i use that that are actually good in terms of their correlation with chronological age and their association with all cause mortality risk which is why i use them so how good or not is aging.ai just like we evaluated lavine's test pheno ag so in terms of its correlation with chronological age it's not as strong 0.80 but still that's considered a strong correlation as higher than 0.7 is considered strong what about all cause mortality risk which is what we can see here so in this study and note that all the papers in the video will be in the video's description so if you want to check it out it'll be in the video description so for people that had a at least an at least 5year younger biological age using aging.ai compared to their chronological age they had a significantly reduced all cause mortality risk shown by that green rectangle as it's 95% confidence interval that's the horizontal line on both sides of that square is completely to the left of the hazard ratio of one conversely for people who had a 5-year older aging.ai age relative to their chronological age they had a significantly increased all cause mortality risk as you can see that the 95% confidence syal is completely to the right of a hazard ratio of one so aging.ai just like pheno ag is strongly correlated with chronological age and is significantly associated with all cause mortality risk theyby hide highlighting their usefulness and uh potential efficacy in uh uh predicting age and potentially mortality risk so with that in mind what's my biological age using aging.ai so when entering its 19 component biomarkers as shown here and i use the north american data set for anyone who wants to double check the numbers uh i'd get an aging.ai age for this test of 30 years which is 20.8 years younger than my chronological but note this is just one test so just like we did for lavine's test for more context let's have a look at previous aging. Data and that's what we'll see here so i have 44 tests dating back to 2009 but when i first started measuring in 2009 it was at most once a year as you can see that there are three blood tests uh from 2009 to 2013 nonetheless over those three tests my average aging. Age was 32 years and then in 2016 i i decided to start testing more often to get a more accurate representation of year-to-year changes testing 34 times over that 7-year period from 2016 to 2022 with an average aging aging.ai age of 29.8 years all right so what about 2023 so for the seven tests in 2023 including the most recent test with 30 years old my average do aging.ai age was 30 years old so what we can see from these data is that over the last 8 years my aging.ai age is stable at an average age of 30 years so it hasn't increased or it hasn't decreased either so potentially good news especially you know as we know my state of goal is to live longer than anyone that's ever lived and to do that i'd expect to be able to maintain biomarkers of many organ systems as close to flat as i can for an indefinite period of time how long i can do that we'll see but i'll be detailing it with videos for the next 70 plus years on the channel so stay tuned so at this point in the video i usually say what may be contributing to these biological age reductions including diet and or supplements and in the interest of time note that this is still a side job if you want to see that change make sure you like and and you know share and all that good social media jazz to support the video so i'll have the time to show that data in next week's video uh exactly a week from today but for now let's dig into the full blood test report as i'd like to highlight some strengths and some weaknesses so first let's take a look at my hdl which was 56 i've shown in earlier videos that uh hdl in the 50 to 60 range is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk in very large epidemiological studies but but getting hdl greater than 50 has been a challenge until relatively recently more specifically for the last five tests my hdl has been greater than or equal to 50 migr per deciliter whereas for the 43 or so test before that since 2015 it was an average of 45 milligram per deciliter so i've made progress on getting hdl into that quote unquote optimal range and i'll detail that progress in an upcoming video uh relatively soon so many videos to make though all right and then we can see the hr hscrp at less 0.3 mg per liter glucose is at the bottom of the page and then moving forward to highlight a potential weakness it would be creatinine as a marker of kidney function so creatinine levels increase during aging in part because kidney function gets uh worse at removing it from the blood now for the last five tests my average creatinine level has been 1.01 mg per deciliter in contrast over the previous 43 tests since 20 2015 it was 0.95 mg per desia now that may not seem like a big difference statistically using a two sample t test you can see the p value is less than 0.05 so they are significantly different but knowing that creatinine levels increase during aging and seeing that i do have a small but significant statistically significant increase it's going in the wrong direction and i want to get on top of that sooner rather than later and get that back to at least 0.95 or below if i can obviously without affecting muscle mass as creatinine can be is proportional to muscle mass what i'd also like to point out are nutrifil levels for a couple of tests in 2023 they were less than 2,000 and note that nutrifil is less than 2,000 is associated with increased risk of death for all causes so i i want to be in the 2,000 to 3000 range and with this test i am back just barely into the 2,000 range which is exactly where we want to want to be just above 2000 as nutrifil is increased during aging and relatively higher levels again are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk now there were other tests that i also measured that i don't yet have data for but that data should be coming in very soon soon including free testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin so once that data comes in expect to see a video on the channel about that and on the same day as this test i also sent blood for nad epigenetic and tmia testing and metabolomics so expect upcoming videos on all of those uh topics data breakdown all right that's all for now if you're interested in more of my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at uh epigenetic and teir testing any de quantification or a microbiome composition at home metabolomics which i almost said first but it's an it's in a different order today at home blood testing with scifox health including apob green tea diet tracking with chroner or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or die trying brand as i've got on here that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day he
