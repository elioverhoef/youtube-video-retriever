# Blood Test #3 in 2023: Supplements, Diet

By Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! 


## Transcript

For blood test number three in 2023 we saw that my biological age using dr morgan levine's biological age calculator pheno age was 16 years younger than my chronological similarly when using aging.ai it was 17 years younger so what's contributing to these data so first up let's take a look at supplements and for those who are familiar with the channel the first two shouldn't be a surprise i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s so i've been taking levothyroxine since then and then also in the non-summer months i supplement with vitamin d a thousand ius per day but then what's specific to this test is that i supplemented with serine the amino acid serine and vitamin b6 or more specifically paradoxal 5-phosphate for the 49 day period that corresponded to blood test number three in other words the day of blood test number two which was march 6 2023 to the day before blood test number three on april 23 2023 for that 49 day period my average serine intake was 1.9 grams per day and my average vitamin b6 intake including from supplementation was 11.3 milligrams per day which is a 3.5 fold increase over my previous average for test number two so why serine and b6 well first i expect expected that syrian and b6 would potentially reduce homocysteine and i have a video on that so if you missed it it'll be in the right corner and then similarly b6 can potentially increase nad and if you missed that video that too will be in the right corner now note that in the presence of syrian and b6 which were new supplements again that corresponded to blood test number three there was no dramatic improvement or worsening of levine's biological age data in the presence of these two supplements so you can see that although my most recent test which was 16 years younger is a little bit worse than the first two tests in 2023 it's still at the lower end of my range since 2022 and even be up before then similarly actually not similarly but although aging.ai data it seems like a far stretch from the 27 and 28 that i had for test one and two to jump to 33 33 is still within my range since 2016 from 26 to 34. So i'm not convinced that serum plus b6 dramatically affected my aging.ai age either so with that in mind the plan for blood test number four and that test will be in june of 2023 is to go higher for serine and b6 and just as a some info before we get that test i'm going to double my serine intake to about 4 grams per day and my current b6 intake is about 35 milligrams per day so i've tripled that to see if i can further bring down homocysteine and also increase nad while potentially not messing anything else up all right what about diet what diet composition corresponds to test number three here we're going to take a look at my average daily dietary intake and again this is the 49 day period from test number two that right after the blood test number two to the day before test number three and that's we can see here so as i've done in previous videos i ranked the foods from most abundant in terms of intake to least up on it so for this test there were 50 different foods and then the list is ranked in terms of grams now if you're familiar with the channel you may notice that these foods and their amounts have been purposely consistent for the past few tests and that's because after 40 plus blood tests since 2015 this diet including macro and micronutrients is consistently associated with relatively useful biomarker data in my case with a few exceptions of course including horvath sepiogenetic age homocysteine nad and dhea sulfate but i'm working on improving improving those two now my diet does include cheat meals i try to limit it to at most two cheat meals per cycle into in terms of the time in between blood tests for this test in immediately after the blood test i had a chocolate bar 130 grams mixed with peanut butter and jelly and then on the second i had cheesecake on my daughter's birthday now in terms of the junk for this test including chocolate jelly and cheesecake i'd include it didn't include peanut butter as it's whole food and the ingredients were peanuts and salt these three foods are 1.1 percent of total calories so in other words it's a 99 clean diet all right so this list is ranked in grams which foods are top contributors for calories and that's what we're going to see here top 10 foods for average daily calorie intake for that 49 day period that corresponded to test number three in 2023. And note that these data are generated with chronometer and i track my diet with chronometer and if you're interested in tracking your own diet with chronometer there'll be a discount link in the video's description so atop the list in terms of calorie intake the food that contributes most to my daily calorie intake is sardines and then for the other 10 foods it's the same 10 foods that i also had for test one and two in 2023. Albeit in a somewhat different order all right so what about macronutrients and calorie intake so first in terms of calorie intake or energy intake my average daily calorie intake was 21.74 per day which is tied from my lowest average daily calorie intake since i started tracking diet in april of 2015. Note that 2177 was my previous low and i'm not intending on going lower yet i'm getting away from my body weight to plateau before deciding to make a further cut all right what about macronutrients so first starting with protein intake 96 grams per day when multiplied by four calories per gram we get that protein intake was about 18 of total calories what about fat intake so average daily fat intake was about 82 grams of fat per day and when multiplied by nine calories per gram that yields 34 about 34 of total calories and if you're interested in how that fat breaks down including monounsaturated polyunsaturated omega-3 omega-6 saturated trans fats and cholesterol that data is all provided there all right next up is car intake that corresponds to test number three in 2023. So first we can see that total carbs were 300 grams per day and that might seem like a lot but note that net carbs equals total carbs minus fiber average daily fiber intake for this test was 85 grams per day and when subtracting that from total carbs we get a net carbs of 216 grams per day when multiplying that by four calories per gram we get a net carbs of about 40 percent of total calories now within total carbs note that i also track total fructose intake including total fructose but then also sucrose because half of sucrose is fructose now i eat a lot of fruits and vegetables so that's one reason to track total fructose intake but also total fructose is significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers going in the wrong direction than right so i try to limit my fructose intake as much as possible and i'll have more on the correlations between diet with blood biomarkers in an upcoming video if not a live stream sometime in the summer so for this test total fructose intake was 58 grams per day which might seem like a lot but that's close to my lowest fructose intake since starting diet tracking in 2015 and my lowest was 57.5 grams of fructose total fructose per day now note that if i i've had fructose intakes that are double that amount since 2015 so that it's half that for this test is progress albeit not perfection now note that for fiber fiber provides calories 2.2 calories per gram and that's because with thin fiber it's comprised of insoluble fiber which is not provides no calories both by human digestive enzymes or gut bacteria but also soluble fiber which degrades fiber which gut bacteria degrade soluble fiber thereby yielding that 2.2 calories per gram in other words soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short chain fatty acids or scfas so that provides 187 calories when multiplying 85 by 2.2 and that 8.6 percent uh which is fat converting fiber into short chain fatty acids can then be added to total fat and there we can calculate my net net macronutrients that corresponds to test number three in 2023 of about 43 fat 40 net carbs and about 18 percent protein all right what about micronutrients how does that correspond to test number three and first let's take a look at vitamin intake and it's a little bit small so you may have to go full screen to see it and a couple of highlights for this is that note that there is full rda coverage for all of the vitamins on this list but then even beyond rda coverage note that many of these micronutrients are purposely higher than the rda and that's because i'm following their correlations with blood biomarkers and again i'll have more info on that if you don't already know from previous videos on this channel about how i use correlations between diet with blood biomarkers to optimize not only the blood biomarkers but then also my diet now a couple of notes on this vitamin list we can see that my niacin intake just from whole foods without supplementing is about two and a half times the rda but note that there aren't any hard and fast rules about being higher than the rda because we can see down below my vitamin k intake is 17 times higher than the rda and then last but not any not last but not least is my mineral intake all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before we go we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a dequantification green tea epigenetic testing or microbiome composition at home blood testing and note that the at-home blood testing with cyphox health is different from the at-home metabolomics diet tracking with chronometer or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer aging or diatrine brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching i hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
