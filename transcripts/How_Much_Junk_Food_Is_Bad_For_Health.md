How much junk food is bad for health to address that let's take a look at this recently published study that looked at ultra processed food consumption and risk of dementia and alzheimer's disease so first what is ultra processed food by definition upf or ultra processed food is an industrial formulation that's made with no or minimal whole foods and processed with additives such as flavorings or preservatives and visually what that looks like is what you'd expect soda chips cookies chicken nuggets breakfast cereals alright so on to the associations what's the association for upf with risk of dementia and that's we can see here so on the y-axis we've got the hazard ratio for all dementia so this is alzheimer's dementia vascular dementias and all other dementias and then on the x-axis we've got ultra processed food intake which i'm just going to call junk food going forward in servings per day and adjusted for calorie intake so to address significance we put a line at the hazard ratio of one remember with the dash black lines are completely above or completely below one we have a significant association and that's true for more than one serving of junk food per day now that's significant because we can see that at all intakes above one serving per day the dash black lines are completely above that hazard ratio of one now interestingly at high relatively high intakes for junk food risk doesn't increase by little it increases by a lot and for this study we can see that dementia risk for someone eating close to seven servings of junk food per day had a five times higher risk for dementia the incidence of dementia compared with someone eating no junk food all right so how is serving size defined that's important to know so that we can limit our junk food intake to minimize risk for dementia at least starting off with this study and that's what we can see here on the left we've got food groups on the right we've got calories or energy per serving so note that one serving of crackers 20 calories but one serving of english muffin and english muffin 270 calories one serving of a commercially baked cookie was considered 24 calories which is like one bite but one serving of a hamburger 427 calories so a little bit of scurry data in terms of all the foods on the list weren't homogeneous in terms of their calories per serving nonetheless junk food or upf intake is also associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality risk so first ultra processed food is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events and that's what we can see here cardiovascular events included atherosclerosis stroke heart failure and cv or cardiovascular mortality and this is a meta-analysis of eight studies that included more than 278 000 people the link for this paper and the previous paper will be in the video's description so on the y-axis we've got relative risk for having a cardiovascular event plotted against junk food intake in servings per day and this and the serving size for junk food was standardized better as one serving was equal to 50 grams of junk food per day to assess significance we put up the line at a hazard ratio of one and then once junk food intake gets to one serving per day after that we can see a significant increased risk for having a cardiovascular event and note that the dash black lines are completely above one so we have a significant association ultra processed food is also associated with an increased risk for all cause mortality and that's we can see here in this case this was a meta-analysis of nine studies that included more than 296 thousand people so to assess significance once again we put up that line at a hazard ratio of one and here there's a little bit more leeway it's about one and three quarter servings per of junk food per day we see a significant increase for all cause mortality risk and we can see that because the dash black lines are completely above that hazard ratio of 1 as indicated by the red triangle so to answer the initial question of how much junk food is bad for health based on these two studies more than one to two servings of ultra processed food or junk food per day is associated with an increased risk for dementia cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality all right that's all for now if you're interested more about my attempts to biohack aging check us out on patreon and before you go we've got got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at-home metabolomics and a de-quantification green tea epigenetic testing also telomere testing oral microbiome composition at home blood testing with cyphox health and note that their panel of biomarkers is almost exclusively different from the at-home metabolomics including april b diet tracking or if you'd like to support the channel you can do that with the website buy me a coffee we've also got merch so if you're interested in wearing the conquer agent or diatrine brand that link and all the other links will be in the video's description thanks for watching hope that you enjoyed the video have a great day
