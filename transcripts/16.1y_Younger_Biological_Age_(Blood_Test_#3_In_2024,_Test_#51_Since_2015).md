## Transcript

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades so if we track and optimize wellestablished biomarkers of organ and systemic function can aging and disease risk be slowed so that's the central premise of the youtube channel and with that in mind two weeks ago i blood tested for the third time in 2024 and note that this is blood test number 51 since august of 2015 so with that in mind what's my biological age and we can see that data here this is is using dr morgan lavine's phenotypic age calculator as a metric of biological age and if you have blood test data and want to calculate your own biological age using this test there's a downloadable excel link in the video's description so when entering these data i get a biological age of 35.2 years which is 16.1 years younger than my chronological note that 51.2 minus 35.2 should be 16.0 but with rounding it comes to 16.1 now the lab measurement quest diagnostic lab measurement for hscp was less than 0.3 mg per liter so that's their detection limit so the data could actually be a bit below 35.2 as it can't be higher than3 but it could be lower than3 and rather than looking at data entered into a spreadsheet the screenshots of the lab report are included on patreon so if you're interested in that check it out now it's generally not uh a good idea to get too excited or two down about one blood test so so for more context let's have a look at biological age results using this test since 2018 as i have 32 tests over that time period which is what we can see here so from 2018 to 2019 i did wasn't uh measuring hscp at every test and actually i wasn't measuring it at all prior to this calculator becoming available so over three tests in 2 years average feno age or biological age was 36.1 years and then starting in 2020 i started testing a lot more more often a lot at least six times per year so for six tex tests each in 2020 and 2021 average biological age using this test was 35.6 years over those 12 tests and then in 2022 seven test average was 33.8 years so i did much better than 2020 2021 uh not as well not as good in 2023 to 34.7 and including this 35.2 in 2024 thus far over three tests average biological age is 33.7 years so we can see from these 32 tests that i've potentially slowed biological age i've never claimed to quote unquote reverse biological age or reverse aging that's not what this approach is all about it's the live long enough to live forever approach slowing biological age as much as we can with exercise diet and you know targeted uh amounts of macro and micronutrients so at best i'm slowing it potentially giving myself a a long enough time for real rejuvenation tech to become available all right so what i haven't yet showed is how good or not is this calculator and i covered that in an earlier video so i don't want to go through that through that again in this video if you missed it it'll be in the right corner but for now i want to use a different approach to show how good or not that this calculator is and that's by looking at how do these values compare against age expected data and to illustrate that i'm let's take a look at five of these biomarkers albumin glucose c reactive protein percentage of lymphocytes and the red blood cell distribution with rdw so first starting with the rdw percentage and as a quick aside that's a measure of the variability for red blood cell volume mcv so when looking at the plot for rdw per versus age and note that this is a relatively small study of only 707 people if anybody's come across age related changes for the rdw that are have a much larger sample size as that will be expected to be more representative of what's going on on in the general population please post it in the comments i' i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video so in this plot we've got the rdw per on the y- axis plotted against age and you can see that there is a trend line there and when highlighting it in red we can see that the rdw per increases during aging now based on the age expected data so where my chronological age extrapolates onto the trendline rdw should be 14% or an average rdw for my chronological age would be 14 %. In contrast for this test it was 11.7% which is an average value that would be more likely to be found in youth relative to older ages so what happens to biological age if we change the rdw to age expected 14% and that's what i've done here changed it there to 14% and we can see that there's a big jump for biological age an 8-year increase to 43 and a2 years now note that this is just one test how well have i done since i started tracking blood biomarkers consistently tracking them in 2015 so what's my data since 2015 so i have 48 tests for the rdw over that 9-year period and we can see that here and when using uh when looking at the linear correlation between the rdw per with chronological age we can see that there's a significant inverse correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 and a p value that's less than 0.05 in other words i've significantly resisted the age related increase for the rdw percentage all right so next up let's use the same approach and go through glucose so glucose we probably all know increases during aging we'll see that here on this plot which is a plot of average fasting glucose or mean fasting glucose plotted against age and this is a much larger study relative to the rdw study of 12.5 million people so as i mentioned glucose increases during aging with average values in youth for both men and uh green green and women in red around 85 mg per dcil that increased to more than 100 mig per dcil in 88y olds now based on age expected data and highlighted with that red arrow glucose level should have increased since 2015 with a an average of 99 milligrams per deciliter for someone of my current chronological age 51 years in contrast for this test glucose was 88 milligram per deciliter which is an average value that would be expected to be found in someone approximately half of my chronological age so just like we did for the rdw what happens to biological age if we change glucose to age expected and that's what i've done here now glucose is 99 and in conjunction with an rdw that's 14 we can see that biological age has now increased to almost 45 years but again this is just one test how well or not have i done in resisting age related changes for glucose since 2015 and that's what we can see here over 49 tests now here this isn't a clearly a linear correlation we may there there may be two things going on here and actually it's an inverse j j shape so i used a polinomial function in excel to uh derive this this plot so we can see that i i was increasing in terms of blood glucose levels up until around 48 years old now some of that may be related to age but another side of that story is i was making dietary changes uh and one aspect of that is going too high fat in my case for whatever reason there's associated with higher glucose so it could be some related to diet change and and trying to have a variability in my data so i can look at correlations for which aspects of diet may impact glucose and there may be some aspects of age up to 48 years but over the past 3 years we can see that i've been able to reduce blood glucose levels nonetheless when looking at all data since 2015 average glucose is 892 years and when putting that back onto the plot on the right would be an average value for what we'd expect to find for someone that's about 20 years chronologically younger all right next up alumin and in this plot for alumin versus age it includes about 1.1 million people so on the y- axis we've got serum alumin and on the x we've got uh h now alumin levels as you can clearly see decline during aging with peak values for women and men around 45 and 46 gr per liter that decline to about 36 g per liter in 100y old centenarians now age expected albumin based on my chronological age you can see the red arrow it should be declining over that 9-year period that i have data so age expected alumen should be around 43 g per liter or 4.3 g per deciliter in contrast for this test we can see that abin was 4.9 which would put me closer to youth and we considering a declines during aging that's where we it would be more likely to to be found and just like we did for the other biomarkers what happens to biological age if we change albumin to a age exp expected so that's what i've done albin is now 4.3 glucose is uh age expected at 99 mc uh rcw also age expected at 14 now we can see the biological ag is up to 47 just by changing three of these biomarkers to age expected but this is just one test so how well or not have i done in resisting the age related change for abent since 2015 and i have 50 tests for abent over that uh time period and that's what we can see here and we can see that there isn't an obvious trend in fact the trend line is basically flat and my average albumin levels over this 9-year period 50 tests is 4.9 g per deciliter which once again would be more likely to be found in youth relative to older ages or an average on on average it would be more likely to be found in youth relative to older ages all right next up is c reactive protein and in this plot of high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp vers h this is a study of about 6,100 people this is the largest study that i found that has you know quote unquote pretty pretty picture to show in videos so if anyone's come across uh pictures of age related changes for hscrp in a larger with a larger sample size please post it in the comments again i'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video on the yaxis we've got hscrp plotted against different age groups and this is from younger than 18 to older than 70 and we can see here that hscrp increases during aging now based on age expected data average uh hsc crp for someone of my current chronological age would be 1.4 mg per liter in contrast for this test it was3 milligram per liter and actually as i mentioned earlier for 17 consecutive tests it was3 mg per liter which would be below the range for each of these age groups even the youngest age group all right so just like we did for the other biomarkers what happens to biological age if we change hscp to age expected 1.4 mg per liter and i've done that here in conjunction with with the other biomarkers being age expected now biological age is up to 48.6 years now we're getting pretty close to my current chronological age and we've only changed four of pheno ag's biomarkers but as i mentioned this is just one test how well have i done in resisting the age related increase for hscrp since 2015 and for hscrp i mentioned i only started measuring it in 2018 i have 35 tests over that six-year period as shown here and i probably should have used a polom polinomial function to ill rate uh potential trends because it looks like there's an increase and then a decrease again starting at around 48 years but nonetheless there is a significant linear correlation inverse in other words uh as i've aged chronologically i've significantly reduced hscrp in other words i've resisted here too the age related hscrp increase all right last but not least let's go through the lymphocytes divided by total amount of white blood cells so in this plot of lymy percentage versus age it includes almost 378,000 people percentage of lymphocytes on the y- axis plotted against chronological age on the x and here we can see that the lymy percentage declines during aging for both men and green and women in blue uh yeah i had that right i thought i had backwards with relatively higher values in 20-year-olds relatively lower values in 90y olds now b based on age expected the average value for age expected data for the lymy percentage it would be 24.2% for someone of my current chronological age in contrast for this test the lymph asite percentage was 36.6% which would be off the charts and more be more likely to be found in youth relative to older ages we considering that the lymy percentage declines during aging so just like we did for the other biomarkers what happens to biological age if we change the lymy percentage to age expected and i've done that here now the lymy percentage is 24.2 in conjunction with age expected uh data for alumen glucose crp and the rdw now we can see biological age is just one year away from my chronological age so just by changing five biomarkers using this biological age tool and using age expected data that it's pretty good for you know uh predicting your chronological age based on age expected values all right so this is just one test what's my data since 2015 how well have i resisted the age related or not how well have i resisted uh the age related decline for the lymy percentage and i have 48 tests over that 9-year time period as shown here and here too there's a j j-shaped curve so within my own data there was a decline for the lymy percentage up until again 48 years after which i've been able to increase it now in terms of three of these biomarkers where it seems like around 48 years that i've been able to resist or better resist age related changes what did i do so over the past 3 years i've had a slow and steady intentional uh weight loss mostly fat loss um with the goal in getting as lean as possible to see what that would do to my biomarkers so for at least three these three biomarkers being leaner has a may have a positive effect now my average lymy percentage over these 48 tests is 41.9% which when looking at the plot on the right would still put me at relatively youthful as when considering that the lymy percentage declines during aging now in addition to body weight the diet and supplements or maybe not supplements may be contributing to these data so how how does diet or what is the diet and supplement approach that corresponds to blood test number uh three in 2024 and in the interest of time i'll cover that a week from today uh on may 19th so if you're interested in that come back and check it out all right that's all for now if you're interested
